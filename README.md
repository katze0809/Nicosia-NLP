## Identifying City Phenomena using Natural Language Processing and Geo-location Technology
<div style="text-align: justify"> Travel review sites are used by travelers and locals to provide rating for facilities, services and attractions around a city. Though most of the time the reviews target the specific venue the reviewer is acquiring the services of a lot of time information about surrounding contexts is also mentioned. Such information might refer to the city, the country or even the immediate location of the venue. In this work we will try to extract some information for the surrounding contexts to get an idea of the "quality" of these contexts. Such data will be very useful for smart city related applications to identify issues and perceptions around the city neighborhoods  but also for traveling applications for identifying new places or unknown events around the city. </div>

This project has been conducted for the completion of my internship in RISE (now CYENS Centre of Excellence), a research company located in Nicosia, Cyprus. The company focuses on research and innovation in the field of multimedia, technology and smart solution. This particular project is one of the branch project of MRG DARE (Digitally Enhanced Urban Environment), where I spent my 6-months part-time internship within the organization.
