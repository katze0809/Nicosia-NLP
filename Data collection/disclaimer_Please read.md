The web scraping code is highly derived from https://github.com/giuseppegambino/Scraping-TripAdvisor-with-Python-2020, with some modifications.
Requirements:

- Python 3
- Selenium library + web driver ( I used chrome web driver, check Selenium documentation to learn how to install the web driver)
- Time library
