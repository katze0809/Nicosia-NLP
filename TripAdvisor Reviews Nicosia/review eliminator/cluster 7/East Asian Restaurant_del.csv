50,The Indian cuisine especially is delicious. Recommend the Chicken Jhalfrezi. One portion of pulao rice is more than enough for two. Have it combined with garlic nan.,East Asian Restaurant

10,"I am used ti very tasty and cheap Chinese restaurants and I chose this with a friend because of the good reviews that they had.We were shocked for the prices: 2,50 euro for one spring roll, 2,90 for some shrimp puffs that usually come for free at the beginning of the meal, 9,50 for some noodles...We were expecting at least a very good quality. But NO NO NO. The spring rolls were so oily and came with the wrong sauce, and the noodles were just boiled, nt even stir Fried.Such a disappointment. NEVER AGAINBut what can you expect for a restaurant that offers Chinese, Japanese and Indian",East Asian Restaurant

Restaurant always very clean and deco is super.,East Asian Restaurant
10,"First time visited this restaurant with family and last! The buffet was very poor sweet and sour plates were sour only pieces of chicken and pork tiny lost in the terrible sauce. Spring rolls cut in half , no duck plates or chicken . Rice only steam choice and the prices outrageous. When order a meal out of the menu was awful, sour chicken , with no good taste or smell , never again going back . Prices on the menu are extremely high compared to better quality Chinese restaurants with much lower prices . I don’t understand how people review this and give false informations by rating this with 4 or 5 stars .",East Asian Restaurant
40,Very nice quality buffet on Thursdays! Went for a buffet on a Thursday and I was impressed by the quality cause usually on buffets the quality is not as good as the dishes themselves. The manager came to welcome us and asked if there was anything we didnt find on the buffet and we said 2 dishes. After 2 minutes he brought the dishes on our table for free. Amazing crispy honey chicken and naan bread,East Asian Restaurant
30,"Trying to cater for Indian and Chinese cuisines, but sadly turned out to be neither here nor there. My bench mark indian and chinese dishes did not make the grade taste wise.

50,"East Asian is by far the best Indian/Chinese restaurant in Cyprus. Delicious food, great service, nicely decorated restaurant. Once you have been there you won't want to go anywhere else!",East Asian Restaurant
50,This was an unplanned visit to the restaurant so no previous reservation was made. Possibly that was the reason that it took them about an hour after we arrived to serve us. Under normal circumstances that would be a very big minus. But the food was excellent and prices better than average! The selection of food is very big and possibly unsustainable so in order to keep the freshness and excellence of their plates they may have to cut a big part of their menu! Definitely we will be returning to this restaurant not just for their excellent food but also to check that the delay in serving us was a one off,East Asian Restaurant
50,"Excellent place to be with surprisingly tasteful cuisines, friendly staff and very reasonably priced. Highly recommended!!!!!",East Asian Restaurant

Just when we enter the staff gave us a warm welcome which was nice.Me and my wife decided to have some indian and children went for chinese.After our order was taken drinks arrived to our table fast. Our food was more than delicious and children loved the chinese.Both starters and mains were cooked to perfection and food at last wasn't one of the same cyprus-asian style. Staff were very polite and offered us some complimentary dessert. The place is very relaxing either you sit inside which is prestigious either you sit on the balcony where is more casual. Our night out was fantastic and soon we are returning back because of children that they absoloutelely loved it.,East Asian Restaurant

The service and setting was absolutely lovely too.The real kicker was that one of our guests for the evening wanted an Indian dish that wasn't on the menu. The owner came over and politely asked what our guest wanted. He then spoke to his chef and they prepared it for him, even though it wasn't on the menu!We'll definitely be going back to East Asian.Perseus and his team did such a great job with the restaurant and we'd all like to thank them for catering to every need we had last night!",East Asian Restaurant

30,"uninteresting, and even odd, flavors (felt like the chef is inexperienced).unattractive texture, e.g. the sweet& sour is oily, the coconut sauce is too creamy&heavy, you just can't take down more than a few bites, the so-called szechuan was definitely not szechuan.The beef quality is below average.Dim-sum dumplings still need loots of work. Especially the outter part.Salt&pepper squid was good, spring rolls were ok.Naan bread OK though too thick.",East Asian Restaurant
