10,"the Asty is a bad bad bad hotel. without a doubt the worst ever. My night stay there was an ordeal in keeping my sanity as one thing went wrong after another. we called our travel agent on the phone and they were not surprised at what we told them. The area of town is very shady; esp at night. Guests or ""customers"" are going in and out of the rooms at all hours of the night ; there must be an hourly rate for the rooms. The A/C didn't work at all and the place smelled so bad it made me sick to my stomach. Yes the price is cheap - but you are getting what you pay for and the dump rates only 1 1/2 stars. Oh what a wonderful feeling it was to get into that air conditioned cab and pull away from the curb of this nightmare.",Asty Hotel,Review 326 Similarity,0.236066843,Review 262 Similarity,1

20,I had the night from hell as we came in very tired from a long bus ride and the lobby was filled with cigarette smoke which lingered in the halls. The hotels overall image was not as they had advertised and I couldn't wait to get to Limasol to get some rest away from the rude staff. Yes I say rude when they argue with guests. They seem to have the impression that it is the best hotel in Nicosia. Well the pipes in the showers made this howling noise before dirty water came out if you tried to use hot water. Our overall feeling was after being woken up three times during the night that we were getting what we paid for and was beyond exhaustion to argue with the staff anymore.,Asty Hotel,Review 361 Similarity,0.206835076,Review 276 Similarity,0.507833375

All I wanted was a quiet sleep and not to be worried about noise and safety concerns by hourly patrons making good use of the hourly rate. When I think of all the places I have stayed on Sales and Study trips - the ASTY will live forever in my mind as the one where I was fooled by head scratching reviews. At first it seemed like a run down but quiet inn - our room was a bit in disrepair but you get what you pay for. Then as night fell - noisy ""couples"" started to check in and out. Our shower didn't even work properly (kept going from cold to colder). The only thing good about the place was that there was cabs waiting to take me out of town and away from this place.

We've stayed twice and both times the rooms were spotless with good thick curtains which meant I didn't wake up when the sun came up. Good air con kept us cool, good double glazing meant it was quiet. Balcony on both of our rooms. Plenty of hot water. Comfy beds. Fridge to keep the drinks cool and tea/coffee making facilities. Interesting, well done, decor (we had the colourful and Indian rooms; don't stay if you want corporate bland). Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast buffet plus cooked-to-order English breakfast. Free tea, coffee, water, juice, milk, fruit, biscuits etc., (hope people don't abuse this). Nice public rooms. The shuttle to the town is excellent so there is no problem with the location. Free parking and use of bikes! Free wi-fi! We also got a free late check-out (to 6pm) which was offered without us having to ask; we just commented that we had a late night flight. How many other hotels will do that? I can't think of anything negative and I haven't even listed everything great about this place. In addition, Lefkosia is a very interesting place to visit (both sides) with good restaurants, shopping and historic places. If you go to Lefkosia you must stay at Asty.

However as I type my parents (in their seventys) are staying at the hotel as it is near to the Oncology hospital where my father is having daily treatment. My mother is a keen clean freak some would say she has OCD, therefore finding a spotless place is difficult the first thing she did was check the pillow - spotless. Not a fault to be found. Regarding the staff - They can not do enough for them anything is possible, my father's diet is limited and yet they have gone out of their way to accommodate their requirements. Polite, friendly they two can not be faulted. The food is plentiful and delicious according to my mother - last night they had a free BBQ. If you need somewhere to stay in Nicosia this is it.

20,"my review of the asty consists of two main concerns. you get what you pay for and while the price is lower than the other larger hotels in Nicosia.. it doesn't come close to being a place where I would ever want to come again. Its too far away from everything and to walk into town is not a good idea. You should be prepared for the noise was loud from the avenue and another couple refused to stay with us - you don't get friendly service that you get in a bigger hotel. This is in my opinion a small poor hotel that survives off online bookings from people that have never been there. Well I stayed here and wish i could have spent my money at a better place but there was comfortable but there was nothing i could do about it. I had a great time in the center of the city which is very beautiful, but I dreaded leaving and when you arrive back to the asty - it is like you are in the bad side of town. - Reba 2012",Asty Hotel,Review 366 Similarity,0.382157853,Review 154 Similarity,0.426014323

It is farther to old town than I thought(about 30 minutes walking)but we enjoyed the excursion to dinner one night.

50,"The friend that I was vacationing with chose this hotel and I doubt that I could have chosen better. My room was on the 5th floor and was street-facing. Low noise (but we did go at the end of the summer season), well-functioning A/C (the cleaning staff turns it off if you forget, but it's strong enough to quickly cool the room when you return), comfortable bed, and clean and spacious bathroom. My friend's room was on the 4th floor and I would say the same about that one.The owner and his wife are friendly and helpful. Each morning I was there, they were in the lounge talking with guests and helping as they could. They gave us excellent recommendations and directions on places to go. When my friend made an off-handed comment about hoping her phone had enough charge for the drive into the mountains, Michael went out to his car and brought back his personal charger to lend to us. Although I did not take him up on the offer, Michael also offered to cancel my last night without a fee and book me a room closer to the airport so that I could sleep a bit more before my early flight.I've looked at the few negative reviews people have left here and I can't say that I recognize the Asty in them (although I did not visit the exercise room). The staff (older men and a couple of young women) were pleasant and helpful, and did not seem ""dangerous"" at all. I also never saw anything that made me think the premises were unclean or in a bad neighborhood.If I had to complain about something, I would make two points. 1) One of the times the elevator failed and locked us in, but the man attending the desk didn't hear us ring the alarm a couple of times until we called. 2) If you're planning on not returning to the hotel from outside the city until late at night, be aware that Nicosia's streets make the drive to the hotel a bit twisty; this isn't the fault of the hotel, but if you anticipate getting in late and already being a little tired, it's something to keep in mind.I've already recommended this hotel to a couple of friends.",Asty Hotel,Review 267 Similarity,0.309690052,Review 221 Similarity,0.329045098

50,"Good travel experiences are more often about the people you meet, than the places you've seen. Nicosia offered us both. We were warmly welcomed by the Asty's Receptionist, Andreas and given a quiet, non-smoking room at the rear of the hotel - as requested in our booking. It was light and spacious and had a great shower over the bath (best water pressure I've witnessed in many years of travelling). Sadly my mattress had seen better days, I rang Reception and within 15 minutes I had a replacement mattress and couldn't have been happier.Our first night's dinner was a few minutes' walk down the road at the neighbourhood taverna. Simple fare, good service and Cinnamon Ice Cream on the house! Don't bother travelling into the CBD if you arrive late afternoon/ early evening.The Asty's owners, Michael and Bobbie really know what guests require when travelling and have created a home from home. They were often in the lounge area themselves: open to have a chat with the guests: my Mum loved discussing the Embroidery Bobbie was working on.An ample buffet breakfast fuelled us for the day ahead plus there was complimentary Tea & Coffee, sweet treats, fruit and even Rice Pudding in the communal fridge incase we were peckish - just as you'd hope to find in a relative's fridge.Asty's complimentary Shuttle Bus Service dropped us in and out of the city centre each day, then delivered us to the Bus Station for our return journey to Paphos. Michael, his family and staff really do welcome you as if their own family. Don't be put off by the Asty being a little bit out of Nicosia's centre - if you require a good night's sleep and a warm welcome it's my recommendation.",Asty Hotel,Review 85 Similarity,0.39808585,Review 138 Similarity,0.32854123

I was 5-10 mins walk away from the hotel when Mr Michaels drove up in the Asty branded car and offered me a ride. That excellent customer service continued throughout my 2 day stay. The family provide snacks, tea, coffee and juice et al for free; you just help yourself. The breakfast is excellent where they will make eggs to order. The large shared space has plenty of sofas which encourages you to engage with other guests. It's 20 minutes walk to the old city but it's pleasant, and safe. If you don't want to walk - the family will drop you off and pick you up. Rooms are comfortable. My advice - ditch the large hotel and come and meet the Michaels family.

I stayed at the hotel yesterday and now I must admit I was wrong. From now on it will be my favourite hotel in Nicosia. No, it is not a five star hotel, it does not have a swimming pool or a spa or dancing monkeys, but it offers something more: they make you feel at home. And they are extremely friendly and understanding. When I arrived I found out that I had made a mistake and reserved a room for…. the next day. Thanks to Mr Andreas I was given the last available room (for three). The hotel’s décor is rather outdated, but the rooms are clean, the bathrooms quite big, the bed is comfortable, the air-conditioning works well. The towels are fluffy and smell nice and never before had I seen in the bathrooms brand new sealed sponges for all the people in the room. They even thought about installing European sockets! There are tea and coffee sets in the rooms, but they are not really needed as you are welcome to have not only coffee or tea, but also juices, fresh fruit, cookies and cornflakes all day long for free! As if this were not enough to make this hotel unusual, when I asked for a taxi in the morning they offered to give me a lift to where I was going in their hotel shuttle.

I would commend booking somewhere through the staff at the hotel, since the popular restaurants were full. However, we walked up to the commercial district at the end of the road and ate a very good meze at a modern restaurant.The price of the stay was very good value for money indeed.

Handed me my key and showed me the snack bar, as well as handing me an invite to a barbeque been hosted by the hotel.The room was big and comfortable, so too the bathroom. I have stayed in many hotels around the world, more expensive and better grading, but none compare to the Asty's rooms.The barbeque was amazing. The souvla was delicious and the eating area had a wonderful aroma of the meat on the spit. There was an excellent spread of salads, rice, potatoes and pilafi (try that with yogurt!). The hotel owner, Mr. Michael was a most gracious host, mingling with the guests and ensuring everybody was comfortable and had a drink in their hand. A very socialable and friendly person. It felt like I was amongst family, not a hotel.The next morning I needed to drive into Nicosia to deal with some famliy business. The receptionist showed me where to go on the map, and asked how I was getting there. I said by car, and she handed me a GPS/Sat Nav device, after entereing the address where I needed to be. The car rental company wanted to charge me 10 Euros per day. The hotel charged me nothing. Such a kind and wonderful touch. I used the GPS for the duration of my stay in Nicosia, and it saved me many times from getting lost.The dining room has a coffee machine and a well stocked fridge, so you can help youreslf to coffee/tea at any time. The fridge contains snacks which you can also help youself to. And again no charge. I recommend you try the rice pudding, and I challenge you to have only one.Wifi was available throughout the hotel, and again no charge and no limits placed on usage.Whenever I walked into or around the hotel, I was greeted by name, and the staff would stop and have a quick chat, asking how I was and how I had spent my day. I really felt I was amongst family and friends and was treated as such.Across the road is a bakery, if you want to try some Greek/Cypriot delights. There is also another bakery about 100 meters up the road, as well as a small supermarket for any odds and sods that you might require.I am hoping to visit Cyprus again, sometime soon, and I will definately be staying at the Asty again.Book this hotel, you won't regret it.",Asty Hotel,Review 293 Similarity,0.442807443,Review 87 Similarity,0.300662186

The price was increadibly cheap, compared to most other Nicosia hotels. The breakfast buffet left nothing to be desired. There were bread, eggs, fruits, all kind of sweet stuff, in a pleasent ambience with much space. The best thing about the Asty Hotel is its great service, however.

Breakfast was simple but ok comparing the price and internet was free at good speed entire the hotel.A 24 hours self service with fruit, coffee and juices was available in breakfast room, a very good idea for the guests when arrive in hotel too late from the work.Location to me was not fine and I didn't see restaurants or shopping area nearby.This hotel is recommended for those people who intend to stay in Nicosia for long time more than 3-4 weeks, reasonable price wise perhaps.",Asty Hotel,Review 41 Similarity,0.4639052,Review 62 Similarity,0.290784545

This 2* hotel is runned by a sympathic family Michael and Margarita and the staff is as good as family as well I believe. Rooms were clean,large enough, airconditioning,good bed and nice bath/shower. Breakfast was great, eggs baked as you wish,the fridge with fresh fruit and drinks for free when you want. On request they will go and buy some fresh fish and they cook it for you in the evening if you want to eat in the hotel.Hairdresser and lovely restaurant in front as well . Bikes for free to use.Wifi works perfect everywhere in the hotel ans very easy to use, no complicated registrations. Wifi, click and done!The free shuttle was the cream on the cake because whenever you want they will drive you till the centrum of the town which is +- 3 km away. We calles and there they were Always with the biggest smile. And believe me the 6 strong Cyprus girls as we were called were not the easiest clients I think. :)Nothing was too much and the prices for the hotel are crisis economic prices for everyone.Next year the Belgan footbal team probably plays again against Cyprus on 6/9/16 so we will be back and we will bring 20 new guests to the Asty Hotel for shure!Only few things to concider Michael and Margarita:pillows on the terraschairs, more afterdrinks in the bar like Amaretto or vodka or Irish Coffees and maybe some large French fresh bread to cut with the breakfast.perfect organisation",Asty Hotel,Review 154 Similarity,0.486152793,Review 32 Similarity,0.288319929

We didn't try the lunch and dinner that were offered but used the shops nearby. There is also washing services walking distance away. There is a bus stop (infrequent) near the hotel, but not many places to go out to around. Rooms are spacious, nice and clean, not luxurious, with cable TV and Wifi. The hotel has many pleasant areas to socialize / study / relax as well as a gym and nice balcony. There is always someone to advise you about where to go, what to do in the island, and a small van to take you there. On holidays they held celebrations and we were invited as part of the family.

They have a shuttle that drops tourists to several spots and picks them up when we call which makes it much easier to stay at the Asty since it is about 10 minute drive from most places and not so easy to walk to Ledra Street where much of the action takes place. One of the best points to staying here is their delicious hot breakfasts; the eggs are cooked to your liking. The office staff are all very friendly and courteous.

50,"We stayed at the Asty for three night during a trip round Cyprus in October (on which we stayed in 5 different hotels), and this hotel was easily the best.We were greeted with enthusiasm and obvious pride by the proprietors on arrival. They offered us a (free) drink, showed us the dining room, and encouraged to help ourselves, at any time, to drinks, fruit, rice puddings, and other goodies from the fridge. Then they told us we could help ourselves to drinks - whenever we liked - from the small but well stocked and unmanned bar!! Our eyes just about fell out of our heads, as offering this to two Scots is asking for bankruptcy. I presume it's just an off-season thing, but this would be worth clarifying.The freebies just kept coming. Free Wifi (albeit slow) in all rooms. Free use of bikes to explore the city. Need to go somewhere? We'll drive you there in the hotel taxi, free. Minigolf on the roof of the third floor, free. Free computer room, gym equipment, on and on and on.We were given a map, had the main sites plotted, and an itinerary suggested, some of which we accepted and some of which we ignored.We were given ""the colour room"". It was large, vibrantly decorated (see photos), and spotlessly clean, with en suite, powerful shower, minibar, safe, balcony, air-con & ceiling fan, and a flat-screen TV with a few English channels.A bus from the main bus station in Nicosia will take you to the hotel (no. 172 if memory serves), but ask the driver to tell you when to get out. However, if the hotel taxi is free, they will come and pick you up free of charge. Note that this isn't always the case - sometimes they'll be on other jobs and it may take a while for them to get around to you. If your in a rush, ask them to phone a cab.Breakfast is a Cypriot buffet (various cheeses, cold meat, toast, fruit, olives, and cooked eggs) which was never in danger of running out. Can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat there.The only, very minor quibbles I could think of: 1) The hotel is a bit out of the way. However, between busses and the hotel taxi it's not hard to get to the centre - either will take about 10 minutes 2) The Wifi is slow - don't bother trying to download a movie 3) no hair-drier or iron, though there was an ironing board. I have no doubt that they would have provided these had we asked, and anyway, who needs to iron on holiday?!As an extra tip - the shop across the road is an outstanding delicatessen, well worth a look. The only nearby restaurant, however (turn right out the hotel and walk 5 minutes) - is a disappointment and should be avoided.In summary, the hotel had all you'd expect from a budget hotel in the UK, but I have never experienced so many add-ons and such enthusiasm from a hotel in the UK (or anywhere else).

There were smoking rooms nearby, but the smoke didn't penetrate my room. The heating was adequate. The tap water was not for drinking (as is common in Cyprus) but a good supply of bottled water was provided.The bathroom was clean, but there was no bath plug and the bath (a shade of blue fashionable in Britain around 1960) and the grouting of the tiles were stained and needed replacing. The shower attachment on the bath was easy to use and had good water pressure. A hairdryer was provided.The staff were friendly and chatty.

50,"We stayed at the Asty while visiting our daughter who was doing a semester abroad in Cyprus. We got the 'Zebra' room and while we chuckled over the theme aspects of the room, we loved how large it was. The bed was extremely comfortable, the room has a sitting area with couch & chairs, a large balcony, small refrigerator, and plenty of room to spread out. Everything was very clean, loved the free WiFi which offered great connections whether you were on the 5th floor balcony, the front patio, the breakfast room, or throughout. The neighborhood was mostly residential, quiet and safe, and I'm extremely puzzled on how a couple reviews mention a bad, unsafe area (Huh?) We rode the free bicycles around the area and saw all the embassies, churches, and other sites. Walking both day & night, we never felt unsafe or that it was in a bad area. The free hotel shuttle bus saved us some serious Euros and they graciously brought us into the City Center for sightseeing, to the bus station to connect with buses heading to Ayia Napa and Larnaca, to the campus where our daughter was studying, and to the crossing border to catch a Turkish taxi to Ercane Airport for our flight to Istanbul. I highly recommend the Asty as a great place to stay. While I love fancy hotels as much as the next person, it's hard for me to spend the 100's of Euros more when the Asty provides such a clean, large, welcoming place to stay with a great breakfast, free shuttle, bikes to borrow, and a great, friendly, and helpful staff.",Asty Hotel,Review 367 Similarity,0.353153217,Review 183 Similarity,0.256230024

And Asty Hotel is a good addition. Interior of the hotel is not very fancy, but still quite pleasant. Spacious lounge, dining room and library room on the ground floor. Tourist materials like maps and folders are available. Also good selection of daily papers.RoomsFirst impression might be that they are worn down, however everything works perfectly fine and remains in good condition. My spacious room had TV, fridge, AC, phone, small desk. Apart from that, it was very clean. Room is more than satisfactory, as long as you are not used to top class chain hotels.FoodBreakfast is served from 6.30 till 10.30. I would say it is “continental extra” breakfast. Fair selection of bread, ham, cheese, yoghurt, vegetables. Overwhelming selection of fruits, sweets (also home-made), muesli and eggs. Huge range of juices and coffee available. Quality of everything is proper. Apart from that, the breakfast room stays open 24/7 with all the drinks and some snacks available. This is very convenient and not typical even for family run hotels.Other facilities and highlightsFree shuttle – within 2 nights I have spent at the hotel, I have used it 4 times, including picking me up from the place where Larnaca Airport bus terminates, which is not very close to the hotel. I have never been denied this service and a car has been always available on stand-by. Brilliant.Early check in – I got a room as early as at 10 am. Truly nice.Roof terrace, bike rental (I didn’t use), gym (I didn’t use).The only Asty’s drawbacks are a bit ageing facilities, but this hotel is still an awesome place of great atmosphere with very helpful, polite and friendly staff.

40,"B&B with an en-suite WC/shower for 43 Euros per day (in January) for two people sharing a room, with complimentary tea, coffee and juices, among other things without limit, is incredible value. Most of the staff were friendly, but one man at one reception one evening was grumpy. The accommodation is simple, and it is reasonably comfortable and clean. The en-suite bathroom in room 213 desperately needs a make over, as the fittings are old, and the walls and floors not very pleasant. It is definitely budget, rather than luxury, accommodation, but there is a kettle in the room, and you can take up what you wish to make from the dining room downstairs. Only polystyrene cup are provided in the bedroom, but there is nothing to stop you taking up cups or glasses from the dining area downstairs. Face flannels are not provided. We asked for a room with en-suite bathtub, and had an email saying that this should be possible. Although we had an en-suite bathtub, no plug was provided, and reception would not provide one (apparently to save water, but as the other two hotels we stayed at in Cyprus with a bathtub had a plug, we found this to be a weak excuse). We found ways to block the plug hole, and had a bath anyway! Breakfast was satisfactory, but nothing special. The 'hot' food was tepid, as there were no lids to the receptacles they were kept in. The free wi-fi was very slow at times, making it next to useless at these times. The other main drawback was that the hotel is a 25 minute walk from the town centre, and situated in any area with few restaurants and no bars. The hotel does provide transport to the town centre, which can be useful, but is not ideal. Free car parking is provided.

50,"This family run hotel in Nicosia is not your modern box in the sky, where customers are just another face in a day's business. From the very start, this hotel and its staff differentiated itself from most hotels we have stayed in.We were flying in from Antalya, Turkey into Ercan airport, in Northern Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus-TRNC). I emailed the hotel asking about how to get from Ercan airport to the hotel. I got a prompt reply from the owner, Michael, telling me that if we telephoned the hotel after we had crossed into the Greek speaking side of Nicosia (Republic of Cyprus), they would happily pick us up (free of charge) from the Ledra Palace crossing point. Once over the crossing, we called the hotel and they picked us up within 5 minutes.We stayed at the hotel for three nights. Our room rate included breakfast. The breakfast included breads, cereals, sliced meats, cheeses and choice of eggs cooked in various ways - hard boiled, fried, scrambled or omelette. In the dining room, there are two hot drink machines providing a variety of drinks. There were also other cold drinks - milk, juices, flavoured waters, and yogurt, rice pudding, and a couple of desserts such as gateaux. All of the above are available free, 24 hours a day: you just help yourself.The hotel also has some hand held GPS units that you can borrow for the day, on a first-come-first served basis. There are also about 8-10 bicycles you can borrow. All of the above are provided free of charge.There is also free WiFi in the hotel with excellent coverage - no dead spots. This is because they have basically implemented a Wifi network on each floor. To use the WiFi you need to connect to each network to maintain Internet access, but this is not a major problem because you basically only use it on the floor you are on, the lobby and the dining room.The hotel staff will drop you into the Old Town and they will come and pick you up if you call the hotel: again, free of charge. We found that even if we were just standing in the lobby, the staff would come up to you and ask if you needed a ride somewhere. The transfer service runs from 0700 to 21:30.Our room was clean and comfortable. We had the room with the 12"" muti-coloured wall tiles and the multi-colored toilet seat, which made sure you started your day immediately you went in the room :)There is also a fully equipped fitness room in the basement, which we didn't use. There was also a table tennis table down these and a foosball machine.While the hotel is an older building, it is well maintained throughout, and our floor (3) had recently been completely repainted.When we left the hotel, they dropped us off a few metres from the Ledras (Lidras) Street border crossing; they recommended this crossing point because they knew we needed to get a taxi on the Turkish side back to the airport. After crossing, we found a taxi right away at the end of the street, so we did not have to hunt one down.All in all, I was very impressed with the hotel, and I felt it was good value. Most importantly, Michael and his family and staff did everything they could to make sure all our needs were met, and they provided lots of good advice about things to see and do in Nicosia, and reasonably priced places to eat.We would have no hesitation about booking the Asty again, and we will recommend it to family and friends travelling to Nicosia.",Asty Hotel,Review 177 Similarity,0.474451488,Review 49 Similarity,0.190570743

If you wish to do this, I suggest reading more on this website (http://www.northcyprusonline.com/North-Cyprus-Online-Travelling-Bus-Services.php) and asking the tourist info after you cross the border for more information (8 Turkish Liras each way to/from Famagusta and 4.5 Turkish Lira each way to/from Kyrenia from my experience but seems like you can buy a day ticket for 1 Lira less)Also, this is an excellent website where you can get info of how to get around the cities on the Cyprus side - http://www.intercity-buses.com/ (there is an English option on the web page).There were a lot of inaccurate information that I got when I googled for the schedules and costs so use the above website!",Asty Hotel,Review 250 Similarity,0.392046158,Review 148 Similarity,0.18074257

The booking agencies state the room type is 23 sq metres but ours was a fraction of that.  We asked to move room but the man on the desk said they were full for both days we were staying.  There was no offer to do anything or help in any way.  The room was a smoking room despite our request with the booking for a non smoking room.  The whole corridor smelt very strongly of smoke despite there being only two nominally smoking rooms.  When we asked for a lift to town, an advertised service, it was provided in such a surly and unfriendly manner that we were made to feel quite uncomfortable.

50,"We had only a few days in Nicosia the last few days of May, and were fortunate to stay at the Asti! We were treated like family! The room was great. Any questions we had were answered right away, and the service we received was wonderful. The breakfast in their breakfast room was a great start to our day, and there were refreshments available 24/7. We spent some time in the old city, and were able to arrange rides to and from there with the desk. When we had some down time (in the early morning, and late evening), we were able to use the balcony to just sit and relax.

The room is a touch on the smaller, sort of Euro sized, but ample. The room I was in didn't really have a desk so for biz travelers, this could be a bit of a difficulty. The wifi was pretty good and since my cell phone didn't work in Cyprus, I pushed that a little. The room was sort of artsy with tiled pieces throughout and colorful tile in the bathroom. The Atsy taxi service doesn't go everywhere but since I was working at the University, they took me two days which was nice. I didn't use the bikes but that is a nice touch also.

You can have it in their big lounge area or on the balcony just in front. The staff is wonderfully nice and caring.
