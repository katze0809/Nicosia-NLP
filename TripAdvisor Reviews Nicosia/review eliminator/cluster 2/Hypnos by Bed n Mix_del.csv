10,I tried to ne in this hotel in October. I made my reservation by the hotel website. I received the confirnation e mail bit unfortunately when I was there the didn't find my reservation. The hotel was full so I was forced to search another hotel. Badly organized!,Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 22 Similarity,0.316227766,Review 18 Similarity,1
50,"This is a brand new 3 star boutique hotel located just under 2kms from Nicosia.As soon as we arrived at the hotel I was pleased of its location, which is off the main road. On entering our superior twin room which was automatically upgraded by the Reservation Manager I felt at home.The contemporary wooden furniture with matching door and furnishings were pleasing to the eyes. The contemporary and clean lines continued on to the bathroom. Double size shower with an optional hand held or a large size rose hanging from the ceiling with high water pressure. The complimentary toiletries ‘Zealots’ are made of natural products. A variety of coffees and herbal teas available around the clock on the top floor where breakfast is served. Your have a choice of cereals, English cooked breakfast, pastries, plain local yogurt and more. Everything cooked freshly onsite.The staff and owner who I had the pleasure of meeting were very professional and helpful throughout our 4 nights stay.On site parking and fast internet is available with your stay. I highly recommend this thoughtfully designed hotel.My congratulations to the owner.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 10 Similarity,0.461690258,Review 4 Similarity,0.5
50,"This hotel is really nice peaceful. The room is very comfortable, the breakfast was lovely, the decor was warm.It’s kind of far from anything, so a minimum of 30mins walk to the old town or around 6-7 euros by taxi. I had work to do so I didn’t mind just hanging out at the hotel for a day or two, but also, it’s so nice that staying out of the town is worth it.The staff were also very friendly and helpful, so big plus there too.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 6 Similarity,0.353553391,Review 13 Similarity,0.447213595
50,"We spent five days here. What a wonderful hotel! It’s new - just ten months old. It’s small. The modern design is beautiful. There is tremendous attention to detail in every aspect.The rooms are comfortable, beds excellent, work area convenient, a pleasant balcony. The room includes a small refrigerator, a sitting area, excellent lighting, ample electrical outlets and even a plug converter.The reception staff is superb - friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, gladly responding to any requests.Breakfast is very good and free access to fine coffee and tea all day is really nice.The hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood, about 2.5 kms from the Old City. It takes half an hour or so to walk there. We used taxis which were not expensive. Taxi drivers were all familiar with Hypnos and presented no problem getting here. Restaurants and shopping are not in close proximity to the hotel.A super special addition is a smartphone in each room to use while here for local and international calls as well as internet and google maps at no extra charge.A wonderful place to stay. Highly recommended and would gladly return.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 11 Similarity,0.426401433,Review 6 Similarity,0.428571429

50,"As a traditional 50+ traveller we hadn't yet encountered the modern world of travel.You get not only free WiFi, you get a Smartphone with 5G for use in- and outside of the hotel during your stay, which is also your 24/7 access to e.g. services.Besides that, it's a modern style clean and pretty new hotel a little bit outside the city center, but still in 20-30 min walking distance to the old town.Room is equipped with what you need, a fridge is always helpful, the bathroom is a little bit to small and lacks place to pur your things and towels. Balcony was nice to relax and gives a perfect view on the entertaining evening soccer match of the local team nearby.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 20 Similarity,0.372104204,Review 10 Similarity,0.4
50,"We stayed for 5 nights and I can honestly say we had a wonderful stay. The hotel has a very modern and elegant decoration while in all common spaces there is an extremely pleasant scent. The room was spacious, nicely decorated with all amenities we could wish. The bed was as we like it firm and comfortable. The breakfast was splendid too, even though due to Covid-19 policy there was no buffet, we had various options to order from , all of which delicious. Highly recommended.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 1 Similarity,1,Review 1 Similarity,0.353553391

Design features in and outside are pretty brilliant.Breakfast with a view at the top of the building and they have a very good selection to.I would 100% stay here again, I wouldn’t even look at staying at anywhere else.Well done to the team here.And now I can recommend a hotel to friends and family now in Nicosia.The city falls short of any quality city hotels.

50,"I’ve just returned from a five day break at this hotel and would highly recommend.Location: Situated in a quiet residential area, the hotel is close to a great Greek bakery and close to the old town as well.Rooms: The rooms are immaculate, very well cleaned on a daily basis with the most comfortable beds and pillows I’ve ever had - and I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels! Excellent toiletries supplied, soft fluffy towels and clean bedding. Aircon and heating (it was chilly so hearing was needed at night!) made the rooms even more comfy.Phone: you get a phone in your room which you can use to make calls anywhere. This is a very clever and useful feature, especially as you can use the internet on it as well.Breakfast: The breakfast is just what you need, simple but with a lot of choice nonetheless. Coffee and tea is served all day. You can also order in from local takeouts in the day and a menu is provided.We booked for 10 people as we were going for a family wedding, and the owners and staff couldn’t do enough for us - not just during the stay but before we even got there.They are wonderful, kind, helpful...just brilliant!They have recently opened the bar on the 4th floor. We made sure to give them as much custom as possible by bringing the whole family (about 50 of us!). The staff didn’t even bat an eyelid at the amount of people turning up so last minute. Drinks were served without a hitch and they were happy to chat to us all. They were very welcoming. The drinks choice is great as well!WiFi is free and not flaky at all.A perfect stay and a perfect hotel.

I was amazed at the whole concept of this unique hotel. Super clean and a breakfast with a view. Super relaxed sleep with the Coco-mat mattresses, perfect to beat my jet lag. I will definitely come back in 2 months time since the owner, Savvas is super-friendly and he even gave me a list of the best Cypriot food restaurants in the Region.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 33 Similarity,0.353553391,Review 14 Similarity,0.223606798

King size bed, great linen, fresh smelling towels, efficient a/c, good Wi-Fi, free parking, good breakfast.

50,"Stayed one night and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff are friendly, the room is well appointed with a very good big super-king sized bed. It was very clean and the bathroom was small but modern and the shower was very powerful. Easy to regulate the hot water which came through quickly both in the evening and next morning.There is a coffee/tea machine on the 4th floor where guests also have their breakfast. There was plenty of choice at breakfast time - cereals, dried apricots, almonds, fruit, cheeses, different breads, jams, marmalades, honey, croissants, cold cuts, tomatoes, cucumber, yoghurt as well as a small selection of hot items...bacon, eggs, potatoes etc. Also halva, cake, juice and coffee from the machine. Tea bags are available and cold and hot water. There's a toaster to use if you want toasted bread but don't use it on top whack. It's powerful and easy to overdo your toast. We were very happy with our breakfasts!The room also contained an A.C. unit, hairdryer, safe and small fridge as well as a wall mounted television. The location isn't central but it was quiet overnight. Very good value - there are cheaper hotels but this is worth the extra few euros - recommended.

50,"This is a very modern, high-quality accommodation. The decor oozes nordic minimalistic charm with quality accessories and finished to perfection. The rooms are well apportioned, spotless, with firm beds (my priority), ample reading space, roomy wardrobes, comfortable sitting and top notch wifi connection.Finished off with a free top range 4G phone to make free calls to anywhere. Unfortunately, my phone did not work, though I did not really need it, just wanted to try all the facilities.Our room boasted American style walk-in shower with high pressure dual powerful shower heads. My wife did not want to leave the shower. It was so nice. The only very minor issue I had was the toilet roll holder was behind you when on the stool. A very minor inconvenience. Apart from that, this is excellence personified. The towels are of rich Egyptian cotton, so plush and soft. I love it.Service was excellent. The receptionist was helpful, accommodating with a ready smile.The rooftop breakfast area is a great idea and perfect for socialising. I spent a whole evening there just soaking in the view and enjoying my tea (free all day and night)There is a minor issue with parking, but that is typical of Nicosia as a whole. It is not a parking friendly city.The location is perfect. It is close to the old city and not far from the new. So ideal for business and pleasure. There are eateries of all tastes and dispositions at walking or short driving distances. Ideal for a short or long holiday.I highly recommend Hypnos and I shall be back.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix,Review 24 Similarity,0.196116135,Review 26 Similarity,0
