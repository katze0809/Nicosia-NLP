The kebab on the skewers was tasteless. Also, instead of it being served on a pitta bread spread with tzandziki and source, it came on bare pitta bread – the tzandziki and sauce were contained in a small cup each, in what was not even a sufficient quantity.The place was spacious, clean and tidy.

50,"I've visited Elliniko many times in the last 6 months. I waited until now to write a review because nornally all new restaurants try their best at first until they are established and then they try to cut costs on the expense of the quality and quantity of the food. This is not the case with Elliniko. For six months I noticed that the food was improving while the prices were not changing. For example the smoked pork was a bit salty and gradually they managed to control the amount of seasoning. Additionally the quick lunch menu was a nice surprise with a variety of dishes, meat, salads, poultry paying aproximately 9 euros per person and have a full meal.The food is really not expensive. The secret is that you have to be careful about the amount of food you are ordering. The menu has an incredible variety of dishes and it can be confusing. First time I visited the place with my wife I paid around 30 euros per person and there was plenty of food left untouched. I had them pack it for take away and my wife and I had it for lunch the next day and there was still leftovers. Next time I visited, I asked the waitress to help me with my ordering and the bill was approximately 15 euros per person and still had a small amount of food left on the table. Bottom line ASK THE STUFF TO HELP YOU.The stuff is mainly young people acting exactly how I like to be treated as a customer in a greek taverna. Friendly but also professionals. Attentive but also discrete. Well done boys and girls!On the downside the place can be really noisy and crowded during the weekends and people who like peace and quiet should prefer visiting the place during the week. Additionally they should consider adding more options for desserts.Overall I believe that this is a restaurant that fits my needs and I hopefuly they will continue maintaining their high standards.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio,Review 198 Similarity,0.365977656,Review 41 Similarity,0.390566733

Yiaourtlou was just a joke, with over salted meat on plain pitta and a tiny side sauce. Small fried fish gavros, served plain without anything aside, no salad, no chips, not even lemon! Chips are pre-fried of course, forget the fresh. Tsipouro was served in the correct tall glass but with ice in it, which is wrong if you are not asked first, because many people (like me) drink it straight.

At that point I thought that maybe that was a fluke and the rest of the food would be decent...but unfortunately it was not the case. My pork souvlaki was pink, the fries smelled of burnt oil, the 'politiki' salad was completely wilted and had too much salt. The list goes on. However, my most serious concern relates to misselling- we also ordered a 'mosxarisia brizola' (beef steak) which I am quite convinced was in fact a pork chop of some description put on the menu at at a considerable mark-up (€16). The waiter reassured us that it was beef however I remain unconvinced. I can't recommend this place I'm afraid.

As part of our wedding we therefore wanted to organise a dinner (a day before the actual wedding) at To Elliniko for 60 of my friends. Spoke to the owner beforehand to discuss a budget and gave him freedom to create a menu that would suit locals and foreigners.From the moment we entered drinks arrived at the table and soon after the food came out. It was simply delicious. The starters to share were so good .. my friends kept on raving about them! Then the mains arrived and again people were so happy. The quality of the meat was sublime ; not dry at all and perfect in taste! The chef has really taken the Greek cuisine and put his own mark on it without losing any of the traditional elements. He must be so talented.What surprised me most of all was the consistency of the dishes and the way how logistics were handled. Every dish arrived at the same time at the table, looked stunning and tasted the same....for me it is mind-boggling how the chef and kitchen managed to deliver such high standard for such a big group of people.I can't thank the waiters, staff, chef and manager enough for adding such a special touch to our wedding!I will return , maybe not with such a big group :)) ...

20,"The location is easy accessible. Plus it's a positive fact that it is not directly adjacent to the main road and parking is easily accessible and free which is not the case in Nicosia anymore as many parking spaces are unfortunately privatized. The interior design is suitable for a Greek mezze place, the waiters are polite and attentive and there is a good display of gourmet products to purchase if desired. However it would have been nicer if there is a bigger variety of products focusing more on Greek produce or from Thessaloniki region which directly relates to the food instead of yet another place that also sells Cypriot produce. A further speculation and study on the products provided for purchase. In regards to the food which explain the poor-rating is that the portions are very sufficient for a mezze but the quality of food is very average. We would rather pay the same price for their dishes, but have a smaller portion and invest more in the quality of the ingredients used. The flavor component needs a lot of work to be satisfactory. We felt that it was lacking a lot on seasoning, the use of Mediterranean herbs and good olive oil. We also felt that some of the components of the dishes were prepared a lot of ahead of the serving time and were just assembled therefore not as fresh before they are to be consumed and for the amount of people in the kitchen this did not justify it. They were well executed in presentation but the quality has a lot of faults. It has an interesting menu and an interesting choice of dishes put up together so we would really like to try out more of the dishes but for the meantime we won't be going back until we hear from word of mouth that the quality and freshness of food has elevated itself. Also if we compare to a lot of the new pop up local restaurants in Nicosia, for the price we paid, we can get better food, better quality and more quantity elsewhere. We couldn't finish all the dishes because they were huge portions for mezze and at some dishes it was unnecessary to have such a large portion especially when it's a dip as a starter, and this didn't give us the chance to get a more variety to try because of the expense and portion size of every mezze dish.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio,Review 206 Similarity,0.282528966,Review 77 Similarity,0.201007563

Yes, we agreed a menu up-front so the kitchen knew what to expect .... but it usually takes time for a kitchen to get up to speed. Not here ! .... delicious dips and small starters were put on the table in no time, the drinks arrived .. and people were getting comfortable ... having a great time.From there onwards .. it went only crescendo! Given that we had many foreigners in our group, we decided to go with a nice selection of typical Greek food. I don’t know if a Greek restaurant finds it harder or more easy to please foreigners (as they don’t know what to expect) ... but I personally was very happy to observe that all the Cypriots present (I’m Dutch myself) were really impressed by the food. And our foreign friends were also blown away.To put a long story short; we had a great evening.

50,"One of the four or so restaurants in the Hilton Park Nicosia is the To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio, offering Greek mezze dishes. It was always my understanding that mezze are small dishes, hot or cold, spicy or savory, similar to Spanish tapas. The operative word is “small.” The dishes I ordered were anything but small – but humongous!Before ordering, I was given bread and a small complimentary dish of potato salad with a light mustard dressing. I normally do not like potato salad with mustard dressing, but I found this version to be quite tasty and would order the appetizer version listed on the menu (€5.50) if I were come again.For what thought would “small” dish appetizers, I ordered the Armenian pastourma - highly seasoned, air-dried cured beef (€5.50) and an order of pan fried fresh mushrooms with cognac and balsamic vinegar (€6.50). This would be followed by my “main course” of horiatiki – a country style salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, olives and feta cheese (€7.00). I also ordered a 650ml bottle of domestic Keo beer .When the pastourma arrived, there were 8 pieces on top of a huge amount of what appeared to be politiki – a cabbage salad with carrot, celery and red peppers. This was surely enough food for 2 or 3, after all, I expected this to be an “appetizer.” The pan fried mushrooms were hot and very tasty. I would have ordered another if I didn’t already have the pastourma and the horiatiki salad was still to come. The horiatiki salad, like the pastourma was quite large, enough for 2 persons sharing.The offerings were tasty and the service was fast and efficient with no mistakes in my order. I could only finish the mushrooms as the two other plates were large. My waiter offered to put the remains in a take away container. I later placed it in my hotel room’s mini bar cooler to keep it from spoiling, so I could eat it the next day.I would definitely come again, if just for the pan fried fresh mushrooms with cognac and balsamic vinegar.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio,Review 148 Similarity,0.499445369,Review 3 Similarity,0

Loved the dips in the appetizers section, especially the Fava and the Melintzanosalata which are unique and different from what you will find elsewhere and honestly the Kolokithokefte was the best i have ever had! I had fish for a main and the waitress recmmended the grilled Sardela which is one of their most popular dishes and i believe it was totally worth it. I also tried the Kritharotto with seafood on the other occassion i visited, which was good overall, although i believe it would have been better if it was combined with tomato sauce.

50,"To Elliniko has come to join other contemporary Greek cuisine inspired restaurants in Nicosia like Pantopolio and Souxou Mouxou. Yet its rather more casual atmosphere makes it not so much of a rival as a welcome addition, occupying its own niche. And in spite of it being part of a franchise, Ellinikon has enough character and style to make it just right for a business lunch as well as a family lunch, dinner with friends or a romantic dinner. The crowd (and it is crowded) is mostly young and well healed.While they make a point of informing one that one serves the wine/drinks oneself, service is friendly, efficient and very polite without it being intrusive.The menu is quite extensive with sections for cold starters, salads, hot starters, fish and meat grills and pot/oven cooked main courses. The food on offer is generally traditional dishes with a contemporary/imaginative flair.A tomato and green chilli dip comes with the complimentary slices of crusty country bred.The Village Salad is crispy, properly dressed and comes with very large slices of excellent fetta cheese (creamy and fresh, not the variety that curdles your stomach). Our starters were delicious - cheese baked in filo pastry and drizzled with honey, fried courgette balls (kolokithokeftedakia) oozing with Greek aromas and fresh mint, served with a yoghurt dip.We were so full that we shared a main of grilled calamari. The calamari was perfectly barbecued on wooden skewers (tender and juicy), lightly drizzled in olive oil and lemon and served on a bed of salad.I tried two deserts. Kazan Dipi or burnt cream (no Creme Brule, this) and a cinnamon dusted, cream cheese covered, syrup soaked sponge were good but betrayed the franchise nature of the establishment.All washed down with an averagely priced Greek red (Paranga) the meal came to €30 per person, a generous tip included.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio,Review 245 Similarity,0.189388505,Review 125 Similarity,0
