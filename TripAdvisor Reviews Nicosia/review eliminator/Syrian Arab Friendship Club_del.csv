The meal was just wonderful; it's very big restaurant and you need to be good with that; the service was really attentive and helpful though. There was some dreadful football dross on the TVs while we were there (and there are a lot of TVs) but it strangely seemed quite good and the food was the reason we were there.And the food... oh, the food!

The pitta was not fresh, the dips you couldn't tell easy what they were as they had very mild taste and wasn't something special...their falafel wasn't something special also, we had much better elsewhere... In overall, for such a vegetarian friendly cuisine, their meze was very poor and not great...Another thing we didn't like it was that when you sit they bring you a bottle of water, for each you pay for it later (2 euros), without ordering it or want it...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club,Review 141 Similarity,0.412478956

They do a vegetarian meze (which is actually the normal meze minus the meat, but €6 cheaper) and of course if you've a particularly healthy appetite you can always add in a couple of other dishes like spinach pies and breaded cheese. We did this and there was still far more than we could eat.Other positives include a car park, fair value for money and very nice Syrian coffee (which we inadvertently ordered after asking for the bill, so they said the coffees, which should've been €6, would be 'on the house' - you really can't complain about that!).The only downside (and the reason it gets 4 rather than 5 stars) is that, despite giving us free coffee and lovely food, the waiters (all male) were just a little bit stand-offish. I wouldn't go quite as far as saying they were unfriendly, but in comparison to the vast majority of restaurant staff in Cyprus, they were significantly less friendly.

We thoroughly enjoyed the felafel and the fried bulgar wheat stuffed with minced lamb starters and were really pleased with the mixed grill. I tried the Syrian sweets, but they don't look like the picture on the menu and for me, they were not quite crunchy or light enough. I prefer the ones I had in an Israeli Arab village several years ago and have never found any to be quite as good.That said, we decided to come back again the following evening and really went to town on the order, making our own mezze, in effect: felafel, hummus, spinach pies, and lamb sausages, two different salads, chicken kebabs and lamb kebabs: all thoroughly enjoyable but definitely a case of eye bigger than stomach. No worries: the remainder was packed up for us to take away for tomorrow's lunch.

For a starter, I had Shawander (a beetroot, tahini and yoghurt dip) with pitta bread. My main course was Shish Tawouk (seasoned chicken pieces) with salad. Both courses were delicious - in my opinion, the best food we had on our stay.This would be a five star review but for one slightly irritating feature. Like most of the diners, we were seated in the smoking area of the restaurant, which may technically have been exempt from the smoking ban in Cyprus but was a covered area which appeared to be enclosed. The ventilation was fairly good, but the smell of cigars and shisha was noticeable while we were eating. There was also a non-smoking room, but only one table was being used there.
