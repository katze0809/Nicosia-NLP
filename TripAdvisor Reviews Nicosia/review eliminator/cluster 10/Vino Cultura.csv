Unfortunately one of the tapas was not served hot and therefore we complaint to the waiter. Immediately the waiter escalated this to the manager that insisted of serving something else. He did not give any excuses or justifications but he gave attention to customer care. In addition, they served us two more glasses of wine, and therefore made our evening even better.I don't remember ever a cypriot bar/restaurant manager that took so much attention to rectifying a situation than to make excuses for it.Very professional, excellent approach!

You do not find this in Cyprus and the times i have been there, everything remained over and above average. At one point i thought they may have dropped the ball by not admitting to a mistake made within the kitchen, they came through, worked as a team and made it up to their guest.

Having sampled various dishes, including their amazing platters, I was amazed to find out that the chef, Andreas, did not study abroad but here locally in Cyprus. He himself is a real treasure, very inventive and creative dishes. For me, eating inside the Cava area itself is a joy, wonderful atmosphere and to be surrounded by bottles of nectar is so delightful!

Still the bar and the two tables are in direct communication with the rest of the place where smoking is allowed. Went there with my pregnant wife but could stay long due to the stink.

After looking through the menu, our party decided on ordering one of the three complete meal menu options. After that, the food seemed like it would never stop coming. Don't think of this as a dinner, rather as a dining experience served with all of the experiences in a more more upscale restaurant. The tapas-style dinner was a delight, the variety and pairing of the food was genius, and our server knew the menu and made some superb recommendations. The courses were part food and part art, and we had a spectacular experience. The only downside . . . it was our last evening in Nicosia and we would not have another opportunity to experience Vino Cultura again. Go, eat and fall in love with this bar-restaurant. It will be impossible to be disappointed.",Vino Cultura,Review 113 Similarity,0.142133811
50,"I went there for a dinner with my girlfriend and we were really impressed in every aspect. In terms of service, it really was extraordinary and the manager made us feel welcomed. The food also beat our expectations, I did not expect it to be that good. I recommend to get the Set Menu in order to enjoy a lot of small plates (Tapas), especially if you are hungry. You pay a little higher than the average restaurant, but it really deserves every penny.Some things I would like to recommend to the owner and/or chef of Vino Cultura:1) I found the portion of some plates quite small. This is not a problem if you get the set menu, but individually I believe it is. I am not disappointed at all, but I think they could be a little bit bigger (e.g. octopus)2) In my opinion ceviche should be cured/marinated a little longer in citrus juices in order to get the texture right. Other than that, I enjoyed this plate to the maximum!3) Orzo should have been cooked 0.5-1 minute less. Again it was fantastic as it was.4) It would be nice to update your menu provided online in order to match the actual menu on site.5) Please don't take my comments/recommendations as bad. I really believe that by making these changes you could make the best dinner experience. Wish you all the best :)",Vino Cultura,Review 66 Similarity,0.136082763

The decor, menu and service all all spot on.I usually manage to make a booking a few days in advance for 8-10 people. We get a great table and I'll always start with one of their fabulous cocktails. The drinks menu is seemingly endless and there isn't a cocktail they can't make!The food menu is designed for sharing and come in fairly large portions for 'tapas' style. My friends and colleagues aren't so good with sharing so we order two dishes each and are very satisfied. I should add that the service is superb and they do advise you that the dishes will arrive at various times as and when they are ready.I've yet to take anyone there and not have them rave about the atmosphere, quality and choice.The menu is very reasonably priced and I'd recommend anyone try their Makers Mark Old Fashioned!Considering I've only been a few times now it's always nice to be recognised by the friendly team there.I look forward to the next time.",Vino Cultura,Review 134 Similarity,0.089087081
40,"I have been to Vino Cultura on several occasions, mostly with friends, the last time being a month ago. I am not a ""bar person,"" meaning that I do not like the idea of sitting on stools all night, but i make an exception for this place since I absolutely love the food. The portions are small and rather pricey but if you go with the mindset of tapas, of trying different types of food in small portions, you are set. See it as, you nibble on fantastic food! My favorite is by far the halloumi with the pommegranet juice. Exquisite! The other food is good also, from the chicken to the steak. There is nothing really that was short of amazing. My biggest complaint with the place is that they really do not adhere to smoking regulations in a strict way. They are not illegal per se, but the smoking section from the non-smoking is really just a foot away since the now covered and enclosed veranda (which counts as outside and thus ok to smoke) is only a few cm away from the indoor tables where smoking is prohibited. So it was a big disappointment that we came home with stinky clothes and hair and I had to shower all over again.",Vino Cultura,Review 166 Similarity,0.065372045
