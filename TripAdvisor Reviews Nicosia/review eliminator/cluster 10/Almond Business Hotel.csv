20,"Hotel has large rooms, old furniture back from Seventies, I had the misfortune to have the room very close to a new building under construction and there was a lot of noise.The reception was kind of ""I-don't-care"" people, not smiling and neither saying hello when we entered in the hotel.Breakfast is very very cheap, not at business level at all.The zone is full of empty shops and very very shabby, far from the center.I don't recommend it for a business trip",Almond Business Hotel
40,"spacious and elegant with all you need for a business apartment but could do with updating. staff very friendly and helpful. location central and within easy reach of restaurants and shops, local supermarket close by",Almond Business Hotel
40,"I have stayed here as I had a very quick 2 day meeting in Nicosia and as such its clean, its convenient, the breakfast options are acceptable and got a good nights sleep. If you are looking for somewhere to spend your days in however then this is probably not for you as the setup is not designed for this type of break.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"I had been staying in that place several years ago. I was definitely happy to be back again. Located in a quiet street, you can enjoy the relaxed atmosphere; even if the aparthotel is fully booked you never find it crowded: neither in the lift, in the breakfast room or in the lobby ! Rooms are very large ... big sleeping room connected to a living room with kitchen. Bathroom with a large shower. Very clean -I appreciated a lot the perfumed towels. Large table where to work. Nice and helpful staff. The only negative side of my stay was the hot water which -considering I was staying at the last floor ( provided that was the real cause of it)- took always a while (some minutes) to arrive. Excellent price/quality ratio.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Located a regular neighborhood, the hotel is by no mean spectacular on the outside. Once inside, you discover a well kept and comfortable hotel. Everything is spotless and the staff always tries to assist.Rooms are big and comfortable. Although my stay was for business, the hotel is obviously appropriate for families and couples on holiday.Breakfast is basic but more than appropriate.",Almond Business Hotel
30,"This hotel is something of a budget version of Marriott Courtyard properties. I stayed in a 1 BR suite, which has a basic kitchen (small electric stove, sink, mini-fridge). Property was clean, but not particularly luxurious. It's what you pay for - a basic place to sleep. Hot breakfast is nicely done.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Booked for two nights for a business trip. Looks basic but rooms are large, beds comfortable, AC included, balcony and the breakfast went over my expectations.Everything is very clean, which is what you would want as a first thing on your list of requirements! Am due to return in a few months and will be happy to stay again. Good location.The only things that didn't make me give them a 5stars rating are the reception staff - Not very warm, we booked airport transfers (45€) via Almond Suites and I wasn't told we needed to pay the driver cash, that could have been awkward. I mentioned it was my birthday when booking and no little gestures. They recommended the local Monaco cafe for dinner but they didn't have half the drinks we wanted there although there's a more upbeat place called Aperitivo right opposite the Monaco cafe. No bar at Almonds suite which is a shame when sitting on their terrace outside.",Almond Business Hotel
30,"My travel agent booked this room for me but this was a mistake. This is a hotel for families on holidays – I really do not understand the word “business” in their name. Very spacious suite with a full kitchen BUT an empty fridge, a closed bar in the lobby and an automated vending machine for water and minerals are not what you need if you overnight on a business trip. You should watch it if you expect a normal “business” hotel.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"very nice hotel situated 5 minutes from city center, with big rooms and nice showers, free parking and nice breakfast. Recommended for business travelers and families. There is a kitchen and nice breakfast.",Almond Business Hotel
30,"The hotel is well situated in Nicosia, in a quiet neighboorhood. It is a very functional and clean place, with friendly staff.The reason why I don't give it a higer rating, is that it is a very cold place, with almost no decoration, the room in a plain beige colour, and the corridor to reach the room is like an old school, grey and cold.The breakfast is good. It might be recommendable for families, as the rooms are like appartments with a kitchen and a separate living room, but staying alone in this place didn't make me feel at home.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"It is located in a quiet area, at about 20min walk to the old town.A bit bland but very clean, big room, comfortable bed, very good bathroom, fairly good breakfast, free parking, good restaurants nearby.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"the hotel is well located.The room is big, includes both living room and bedroom and both rooms are big. Breakfast was good but good have more choices.Inside you had a microwave, a small kitchen and a table so you could prepare some meal if you wanted",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Nice, peaceful and perfect suits for business trips.clean swits with daily cleaning services, fast internet, easy access to the downtown and acceptable prices.There is parking lot in case you have a car.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"I'm staying in Almond Suites since January 16th, and I am planning to spend another week there, and it is probably the best choice if you are staying for a long time in Nicosia.It is basically as if you live in a 1 bedroom studio with a small kitchenette and a very spacious bedroom.Room is super clean, and they will get you anything you ask for, you have a stove, microwave, fridge, plates, and you can even cook if you wish too.Staff are super friendly and friendly, and you can have free Espresso at the lobby at any time.I definitely recommend it.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Every time I come to Nicosia, I stay at this hotel.A nice, convenient location, very spacious and clean rooms.The breakfast has not a lot of varieties but good choices from eggs to cheese and jams, fit to a fast and fulfilling breakfast.Highly recommended place for a business trip.",Almond Business Hotel
30,A nice business hotel with spacious rooms. The location is good. The personnel is polite and helpful. The breakfast was very good with some traditional choices e.g.haloumi. Unfortunately the sofa was not clean as there were stains on the pillows.,Almond Business Hotel
50,"Very good experience,lacking only on tv channels! Style is modernBig and roomy,queen comfortable bed,separate kitchen and huge sitting area that can accommodate more people, big and clean bathroom. Good for family and business stay.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"This modern, renovated hotel is an excellent choice for families. We stayed here with our 3 kids. Plenty of space for all of us. Very good location. The room is big, cozy and nicely decorated. We even had live flower on the table. The bath gels/ lotions are from very good quality. The only goof was the toilet brush as it was very rousty. Otherwise the rooms was great. The reception area is very nice too. Breakfast had big variety from fried eggs to fried hallumi and fresh fruits. I highly recommend it!",Almond Business Hotel
50,"We have just stayed there for 2 nights whilst on holiday in Cyprus. The room was superb,more like a suite with kitchenette area,dining table,lounge are and good size bedroom & bathroom. Everywhere was also vwry clean & tidy. Would be more than happy to stay there again and recommend to friends.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"It is impossible to rate this hotel highly enough. We spent a week there and we could not find anything that was less than excellent - the size of the lounge, bedroom and the bathroom, the comfort of the bed and the sofas, the cleanliness of the room and bathroom, the equipment in the kitchenette and in the rooms - it was all perfect. We needed WIFI (for work) and each room has its own router with superfast connection speeds. We needed a safe and the safe is big enough to put a Surface Pro 4, camera and documents in. We needed free parking and there was lots of that. We wanted a balcony to sit out on at the end of the day and there was one. (We didn't need a TV but it looked impressive anyway!) And the very effective aircon unit has to be the quietest I have ever encountered in any hotel. There was a good supply of toiletries and the room was meticulously cleaned each day. The breakfast was very good with a huge variety of hot and cold food and the presence of a kitchenette meant you could eat in your room if you wanted. The staff were really friendly the manger available and approachable. To top the lot it wasn't expensive! If it sounds too good to be true, it certainly isn't! We spent ages trying to find something to criticise and failed. Next time I need a hotel in Nicosia this will be my first choice.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"This is a superb boutique hotel just outside of the congested center of the city of NIcosia. Five minutes from the ""old city.""Room was large, like a full one bedroom apartment, complete with a kitchen.On a nice quiet street with parking in the rear, too. Easy and convenient.Free WiFi was ROCKET fast. Each Room has its OWN router so no trouble with signal strength, too !!Kitchen table makes great work area. Staff efficient and courteous.Elevator actually works, and is BIG enough to actually have space for your luggage, too. A welcomed feature !Breakfast was simple, elegant, complete. REAL eggs, too. REAL expresso too, with a coffee machine that works. Not a mob of guests queueing up for food, either. Nice.I would stay here again, for sure.",Almond Business Hotel

50,Whilst on Holiday in Paphos my husband became ill and needed to go into hospital for an operation. By sheer luck l booked this hotel. Being business suites it was quite and a brilliant place for my husband to rest. The staff were extremely helpful and could not do enough to help. The room was an apartment with large lounge and kitchen (Folding doors to hide kitchen away) huge bedroom and good size wetroom. Walking distance of restaurant monnaco which has an extensive menu. Town centre very close.Nothing but praise for this hotel! Thank you for all the staff for your help.,Almond Business Hotel
30,"The room was ok, it was clean and provided all that was needed for a business trip, but it just lacked any vibe or....soul!Breakfast was good each morning, but it had the noise level of a Library and the staff seemed as serious.It was cost effective, the room looked onto a car park, its a little too far from the centre to be walkable but there are amenities nearby so that any traveller can be self sufficient.Did I enjoy it, no not really, would I stay again, no not really.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"It’s a ‘business’ hotel but quite good for tourists as well. The best part about this place is the room size. It’s a very large 1 bedroom apartment. There’s a full kitchen, dining table and sofa set. This makes it a great place to stay if you want to ‘spread out’. The front desk staff were REALLY nice especially ‘Adrian’. Definitely a great place to staff in Nicosia.",Almond Business Hotel
30,"Great little apartments in a pleasant street not far from the centre of Nicosia.Well presented, nicely furnished good size.Served us well for a night stay from Paphos while my partner had a school reunion. Only down side was the air conditioning units vented out onto the balcony, not that the balcony has a nice view but still. Breakfast was also poor on the cooked side of things.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"The hotel is very clean with very big rooms and very fast wi fi. The breakfast was very nice also and the stuff very helpful. The location was also great (walking distance from city center), and was also great that we had free parking.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"it is always a very pleasant and welcoming place. Service is excellent, rooms are spacious and clean. Very suitable for business stays.Staff is extremely nice and helpful; high speed internet available and always reliable",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Spacious appartment well equipped and clean.A little bit outside of thevery city center and not so easy to find, taxi is strictly necessary.Typical neighborhood (Nicosia style 80ies and 90ies) but quiet.",Almond Business Hotel
50,We had very pleasant time at Almond business suits...Rooms are awesome and very clean...The hotel is located just 5 min ( with car) from the old town of Nicosia... Very friendly and helpful staff... Free parking and internet as well...I would definitely go again!!!,Almond Business Hotel
40,"We had a very pleasant stay in Almond Business Suites while we stayed there discovering Cyprus. Ours was a nice, one bedroom apartment, very clean with good, reliable wifi and a nice small balcony.The hotel has a free private parking, and is just 3-5 minutes drive from Old City Nicosia with an easy access to highways to Larnaca, Limassol etc.Additional plus (and quite rare in Cyprus apparently), the heating was working well even on the coldest January days when we had a bit of snow.The breakfast had an ok choice of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for a small hotel (nothing impressive, but ok).The staff was very helpful, especially Adrian at reception.As an improvement I can suggest only following, nothing major:- investing in a proper coffee (espresso) machine (as current coffee machine at breakfast produces instant Nescafe only)- having radiator heaters as an option (instead of heating with Air Conditioning unit) for people who have health problems like asthma and allergies...To sum it all up, if and when we go to Nicosia again, we would not hesitate to stay on again in Almond Business Suites.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Locate not far away from Nicosia center. Suites actually are small apartments really big and spacious, you have the feeling that you rent a apartment. No room service (like you have an apartment) but you can always ask for a delivery service from nearby restaurant. Breakfast is good. My only complaint is the old and noisy air conditioner, I think need a replacement.For business especially if you plan to stay for more than two days it's a nice option.Room price are also a plus.",Almond Business Hotel
50,Room:the room is spacious. has its own living room and dinner area. value for money. The room has its own balcony.its will be great for family to book the hotel here. 10/10Breakfast:it has good spread of food. 8/10Gym & Sauna24hr at your own convenient.

50,"The hotel is situated in a good location, within walking distance of restaurants, bars, etc. The rooms are very spacious and provide great facilities. Breakfast is somewhat limited but of good quality.",Almond Business Hotel
30,"My room was awesome, very nice and large. I didn't like the breakfast though. But the staff were extremely friendly, and when I checked out and forgot a vest in the closet of my room, they were very easy and helpful, even packed everything in a box and sent it to me via mail. They only charged me the postal costs, which I think is a very nice way of helping guests.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"We spent 11 nights at this hotel. The price was good and included a nice breakfast.The suite was very comfortable and spacious with free Wifi with daily maid service. It is centrally located in Nicosia in a quiet street. There is a very good tavern 2 minutes walk away with excellent souvlaki. The staff are very courteous, friendly and helpful like most people in Cyprus.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Stayed two times at Almond Business suites on business. Spacious rooms, staff is polite and helpful, good breakfast although I preferred the mandatory room service breakfast. Overall is a great hotel for business travelers, offers great WiFi in rooms, clean spacious rooms.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"Solo business trip for 2 months fantastic rooms, like an apartment in a hotel... Spacious clean and quiet perfect and couldn't ask for more! Staff extremely helpful and friendly felt like home as extremely modern, wifi throughout and tv with English channels! Great location and lots of restaurants nearby or lots of choice for a takeaway! Highly recommend!",Almond Business Hotel
40,"I have chosen this hotel because it was close to Nicosie town center.Hotel is nice, room are very big and cleanful.Regarding the breakfast, it is good as wellI definitely recommend that hotel if you come in Nicosiethe team is pleasant",Almond Business Hotel
40,"it is a well located hotel: it is close to the down-town and far away from the noise of the traffic.rooms are clean and big enough for a family: the facilities are good also for long stayingthe crew is polite and the service provided is also goodso, if you are planning a business trip to Nicosia...it is the right solution.it is not the luxury hotel but is good and kept clean",Almond Business Hotel
30,- Rooms feel a bit dated / tired- They are clean- Beds are descent - not very comfortable but not bad either- Bathroom is descent size- Living room is spacious and there is a small kitchen if you want to cook something on the go- Service could be better but overall is not bad- Location is not bad either - 15 minute walk from the center- A huge plus is that there is free parking and no booking in advance is needed- No restaurant or bar facilities available which is a big disadvantage- Good value for money- Average breakfast- Overall I would recommend it if you want a value for money and you are not bothered about bar or restaurant facilities within the premises,Almond Business Hotel
40,"Clean and tidy with a functional kitchenette, spacious bedroom and longe/dining area. Well situated for town and the old town. Free wifi, very helpful and friendly staff. Rooms twice the size of the Hilton at less than half the price. It's a no brainer. Breakfast getting better each time I stay, could be a bit hotter though. Thoroughly recommend.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"Visited this hotel several times for business reasons, room mostly located in 5th floor, this time breakfast changed,No more breakfast to room, but breakfast room, which is quite nice, there is more choicetherefore, also eggs and fruit salad, this is a fine improvement. The “security” in the breakfast room had a very cleareye on all things going on, and as soon as the plate is empty he comes to gonna take it away, so in the beginning youmight feel observed, but it is for service reasons, on Friday he was quite easygoing however and the female service ladytook the dishes, so fine hotel in the center with huge rooms and increased breakfast quality and also free and proper Wifi :)",Almond Business Hotel
40,I have stayed in this hotel before as well and my feeling is the same. The rooms (suites) are very convenient and very spacious and you really feel like being home. However i miss the mini bar in the room (it's available upon call) and the bathroom is of average quality overall. What has changed recently is that the breakfast is not served any more in your room but in a room close to reception. The breakfast itself is of poor variety but at least of good quality. Most probably i would stay again despite the fact that recently prices are not as low as it was.,Almond Business Hotel
40,"The suites here are huge and clean, but poor ergonomically. The bedside light is below the level of the bed so reading is hard, the main light switches are only beside the doors (none by the bed) and the air-con is positioned to blow straight at you if you are in bed or watching TV (only in the lounge - no TV in the bedroom). There is no restaurant, so breakfast is brought to you in your room, where you also have a fridge and cooking facilities. Breakfast is OK, but nothing special. Staff are universally helpful and reception staff speak good English. There are banks, shops and restaurants nearby.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"I have stayed in this hotel for more than one time and was always satisfied with the quality of services and offered facilities. Very nice rooms, with kitchen part and open air balcony. Air conditioned. Free wifi and parking area. Very helpful and friendly staff.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"I stayed in this hotel for a week and could not have been happier about my choice. The hotel is excellent, big spacious bed room, living room, kitchen facilities, dining table. The reception stuffs were very nice, polite and helpful. The hotel has free wi-fi which is strong enough to support streaming. Breakfast is brought to the room every morning. Though it gets little bit of repetitive over a week, but the amount and quality is great. From Larnaca airport, I took a taxi direct to the hotel. But you can take the Kapnos shuttle to Nicosia and then a taxi to hotel which would be less expensive. The hotel is not far from the city center. It is around 6/7 minutes in a taxi. I'll definitely stay here if I go to Nicosia again.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Stayed in Almond Business Suits for 5 days. It is situated in 15 minutes walk from Nicosia's business center and shopping streets, and in 20-25 minutes walk from the old city (venetian walls). The rooms were very neat, comfortable, clean and modern. Had room cleaning every day. The neighbourhood is quiet and silent. Service staff is very helpful. Wifi, a number of english language tv channels, etc. Overall, everything was excellent. The only exception is that they do not have a restaurant and serve the breakfast in the room, and though quite a good breakfast, it is repeated every day, and at the third day you can't see that breakfast again. But apart from this - really enjoyed my stay in this hotel.",Almond Business Hotel
40,Rooms were clean and very spacious. Just like an one bedroom appartment. The hotel is sutuated in a relatively quiet area. Breakfast was served in room every day. Staff was friendly and willing to assist on any enquiry. Could recommend it especially for business trips.,Almond Business Hotel
40,"We arrived from Larnaka with a taxi that the staff from the hotel offered to send for 45 euros. The driver waited for us. The rooms are spacious and clean. Good Wifi. Helpful, efficient and smiling team. We had a very pleasant stay. The receptionist recommended a good restaurant. Breakfast is brought to the room, nice, intercontinental and quite moderate. On the whole, if we go to Nicosia again, we'll definitely book this hotel.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"If ever back in Nicosia, I would stay at Almond Suites again. Staff is very friendly and helpful, even lent us a laptop to keep in our room for a bit. Breakfast is delivered to your room. Rooms are very clean, and very large. Spacious balcony, I highly recommend this place.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"Amazing service ,very kind people ,very clean environment .The internet works everywhere it's free for the guests!!It's wonderful to see smiley faces at the reception!The breakfast was great!!Different choices of coffee and tea....Again very clean!!The rooms are big luxurious and warm!The bathroom big.Great choice of bath foams and shampoo!Fantastic kitchen and a lovely couch .The towels are soft and they smell nice.Thank you so much for your hospitality !!Looking forward to see you again very soon!!Best RegardsDemos Beke",Almond Business Hotel
30,"Booked the Almond having previously not stayed here before primarily to keep the cost down of a recent trip. Located reasonably close to Nicosia but probably a 20min walk to the old town. Room is spacious with a small kitchen facility and whilst the lounge and bedroom area were well laid out there were a few drawbacks - No TV in the bedroom area, poor lighting, power going off at night (even when key card left in power switch by the door) meaning gadgets etc were not charging over night. Breakfast was brought to the room but for three days was a little repetitive. The plus side though is the cost at 80 Euro a night that needs to be balanced against the overall facilities.",Almond Business Hotel
30,"You get a modest suite, including a small kitchen.A modest (but nice) breakfast is served in the room.Advantages:spacious.Drawbacks:- The internet connection is extremely poor. The signals are so week that you cannot use skype. It is only useful for checking email.- The safe was looked and I could not use it.",Almond Business Hotel
40,In general very good with almost every need covered. Good wi-fi connection but only in living room (or at least the signal had strength there). Lacks room service and restaurant but this was not such a problem since very nice nearby restaurants have delivery service to accomodate any food needs. Very polite staff. Good location.,Almond Business Hotel
40,"We have stayed a number of times at the Almond Business suites whist traveling on business. The hotel is in a central location with easy access to the city center. The rooms are comfortable, spacious, functional and clean, with a small kitchen which is very handy, especially for long stays.There is also a small gym which can be used for a quick work out.The reception staff are very helpful and polite.Highly recommended for a pleasant stay in Nicosia",Almond Business Hotel
50,"I stayed at the Almond Hotel with three colleagues last week and couldn't have been more pleased. The rooms are clean and tidy, with plenty of space to work. Any problems we had were quickly ironed out by the staff.The breakfast they bring to the room is a real treat and it was nice to have plenty of tea and coffee in the foyer.Without a shadow of a doubt, the best thing about the hotel is the staff. From bringing us cups of coffee early in the morning, to helping us plan our day, they were all brilliant, cheerful and friendly.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"I booked here because I wanted flexibility to be able to cook for myself and not rely on restaurants every night, so the lack of an on-site restaurant was no problem. Anyway, Nicosia has plenty of restaurants. The suite was a good size - main room with kitchen/dining area and living area, plus a large bedroom and adequate bathroom.The in-room continental breakfast was quite substantial, so I saved some for lunch !Price was good and it's well situated near to the main shopping area and most businesses.I will go back when I next visit.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"I stayed at the Almond suite for a 3 day business trip having previously stayed at the Semeli I was unsure as to what to expect.The Internet connection is the best I've experienced in a hotel and best of all free!The rooms are more like apartments, so a much nicer experience than writing emails from the bedroom.The hotel lacks room service, however offers a take away directory that deliver direct to the room, slightly expensive I paid €16 for a pasta dish.Breakfast is delivered to the room-at a time convenient to you, you just need to inform reception. Within the reception area fresh tea and coffee runs all day too!All in all a very good hotel If staying for business, I would definitely stay again.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"We spent two nights here for a wedding and the hotel was booked for us by the hosts. It was lovely, very clean and very well provisioned. There is a living room and kitchen and a bedroom and bathroom. Everything was clean and orderly. There was coffee/tea and cakes available in the foyer for anyone who wanted them. It is a modern and tasteful hotel and the staff were friendly, helpful and professional. If you are staying in Nicosia for a few days this is an excellent place. It is a little outside the old centre but not very far. We enjoyed it very much. There is a supermarket just across the road from the hotel - very handy.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Although there is no restaurant and the whole building only remotely reminds hotel, ABS is a very well placed and ran establishment, with the capacity to cover satisfactorily most of the requirements of its guests. Breakfast is served in room on pre-agreed time and was a bit far from what i'd select but anyway it was rich and with a decent variety. Rooms are actually suites with a spacious living room, a (hideable) kitchenette and a dining table. Plus a balcony and individually controlled A/C. Also in area there are some restaurants and some of the hottest bar-clubs of city. Old city however and traditional hot spots are NOT in walking distance - so consider a cost for required taxi(s).",Almond Business Hotel
30,"It all felt very basic. It didn't start well, when I arrived with a colleague and the receptionist insisted that we only had one room booked - and didn't seem to share, or be sorry, about the embarrassment we experienced in explaining that while male and female, we had booked two rooms. It seemed a great concession that he actually managed to find us another one (the travel agent subsequently confirmed that they had definitely booked two rooms). The nibbles in the hall were a nice touch, but the rooms were sweltering when we arrived (admittedly the air conditioning, once turned on, was fierce enough to cool the place down fairly quickly). The space was good, but all very spartan and the breakfast was very ""plastic"" (processed cheese, cold toast). I accept that prices may be high in Nicosia and it has limited availability of business hotels but I will be trying somewhere else next time.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"good size rooms, clean, quiet, 2 space-room, good location, ideal for business accomodation.decent breakfast served in room.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"This is the second time I am staying at almond and again, I hv not been disappointed at all. Rooms are really spacious. Reception help is very good. Place is very modern, clean and professional for meetings etc. they even hv boardrooms available for useI surely recommend it.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Very nice hotel, exceptional service !The rooms were big and clean, and the staff very friendly and helpful.The area that the hotel is located is not so close to the commercial centre of Nicosia, so in case you want to go shopping you need to take a taxi or walk at least 20 minutes.The rates were also very good compared to the services that the hotel provided. Very good value for money. Recommended for business travellers and for long-stayers.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"Friendly staff, clean with Free Wifi. The rooms are like little apartments, Dining/living room witha small kitchen and a bedroom with ensuite shower/toilet. There is limited facilties but this is more a business hotel. Breakfast is served in your room at what ever time you would like and even a little bit later than their regular hours.Located fairly centrally but would be a fair walk to the city centre or 3 mins in a taxi. I think it's reasonably priced for what it is. Would stay again and have done so.",Almond Business Hotel
20,"Eventually this concept did not work out for me.First, I did not like the fact that I had to be served breakfast only in my appartment.Second, I stayed there during winter period, and the heating system was terrible. Actually there were two airconditions, very difficult to be regulated. When I was in the room it was very warm, when I was out they were off together with the electricity!Third, the place has no character and gives an unfriendly feeling. The very modern decoration of the reception room just made this place show colder and more remote.When you are in Cyprus you do not expect to get such a dull stay!",Almond Business Hotel
40,"I stayed at Almond suites for my business trip to Cyprus. The rooms very good neat and the service was good since this is a no-frills hotel. I was always helped by the staff since I was new to the country. The location is real good with various excellent restaurants & sports-bars around. Definitely a very good choice for business trips.There is no pool in the hotel, but there is a gym available.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Limited facilities such as a gym (decently equipped) and free wifi (good bandwidth). Centrally located in the CBD of Nicosia. Large rooms with 'nothing to rave about' view. Breakfast is quite elaborate and could get you past lunch. Room has a full fledged kitchen, which is quite handy when you are in for a long stay.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"We were very happy during out stay at this hotel.The staff are a great asset here...they are practical, helpful, professional and friendly. We checked in with emergency after leaving another hotel and ending up with nowhere to stay. Reception attended (George I believe) even came to meet us at nite with his motorcycle so we wld not get lost!Rooms are extremely spacious. In fact, they are all suites. The price george gave us was extremely competitive and we even saved eur 700 from the previous hotel.Rooms are spotlessly cleaned daily. One even has a sitting area and kitchenette.This was a business trip and we urgently needed a boardroom to hold various meetings. We we allocated a boardroom even though we had not booked it before, the receptionist even ended up assisting us from an administrative point of view and prepared coffees etc. All this and we were not charged an extra penny for all this 5* treatment.All in all, we would not even consider choosing any other hotel in Cyprus.",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Almond Business Hotel is a nice hotel, well situated in Nicosia in a very calm and peaceful street. It will take you about 20 mn walk to go to the historic center.Service is good and the staff is very professionnalThe hotel is comfortable and the rooms are very nicely decorated. Breakfast are served in the rooms in the morning. And rooms are equiped with kitchen. You can thus prepare your own meals if needed.The only thing we missed there was a swimming pool as we went to Nicosia in August when temperature was really high...",Almond Business Hotel
40,"Almond Business Suites is a reliable and practical business hotel. The suites (actually mini-apartments) are large and divided into three rooms: living room that is combined with a dining hall and kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom (with shower only, no bath).I stayed a full week during a business trip. The staff is very helpful and polite, the rooms are quiet and clean, and breakfast is basic/adequate and served in your room. There is excellent free Wi-Fi internet in the lobby and in the rooms, which is very important for the business traveler.There are also two air-condition units with thermostats and remote control (one in the bedroom and one in the living room), and big flat TV with cable channels. The hotel is close to Nikis street and is about ten minutes walk from Nicosia's downtown. There are several cafés and restaurants in the vicinity but the selection is a bit limited.",Almond Business Hotel
50,I stayed with a colleague of mine in the hotel for three days. The rooms are really clean and spacey and the stuff is very polite. Breakfast was a bit poor and you get served in your room so you can not really choose what you like or not. I would recommend this hotel with best attribute its value for money.,Almond Business Hotel
40,"I was in town for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by this brilliant apartment suite. Friendly staff, excellent quality finish, spacious room, separate sitting/dining room, quiet air con with proper thermostats. A very nice breakfast is served to the room or can be eaten on the front deck. This is a great place to stay for business or for a great central hub but it doesn't have a pool so would not suit people who are on a resting vacation.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"We stayed for 5 nights in Almond Business Suites and much enjoyed it. Rooms are spacious, modernly furnished and clean. Well equipped kitchen (except for the kettle which has to be replaced :). Big flat TV, nice sofa & beds, quick service. The hotel is located at the 25th of March street, which is close to Nikis street and the downtown. Would definitely come back.",Almond Business Hotel
10,Booked this hotel for 5 people in 5 seperate rooms. Hotel was booked for a 5.5 week stay per person. Unfortunately all persons on the eigth floor had roaches in their rooms and one person had to be moved. Any requests to speak to the hotel manager were not honoured and staff was terribly rude to the point where one guest was told that they didn't believe that he had roaches in his room and if he did they were probably from his collection????. Fortunately(or unfortunately) the night that one guest was moved he had CAUGHT 4 roaches under glasses to show the management......still has received apology! Totally unacceptable for a business suite hotel which caters to the business proffessional traveller. Left the hotel and found another for all people staying there two weeks into the 5.5 week stay.Will never stay there again and feel sorry for those who do!,Almond Business Hotel
50,"We stayed at the Almond for Six nights in March. The hotel was great. The suites are very big, comfortable, modernly furnished and very clean. There were Three of us in one suite and there was more than enough space for everyone. There is also a well equipped kitchen. The room service breakfast was very good.The hotel stuff was very nice, friendly and helpful, making you feel at home. The hotel is located in a quiet street but close to everything.We enjoyed our stay and will choose this hotel again next time we visit Nicosia.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"I consider Almond to be my home away from home. This hotel is all that you can wish for when you are in Nicosia on business or leisure. The staff is extremely friendly and will go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable. The Rooms are exceptional, very spacious and well equipped and more importantly, extremely clean. WIFI is available in the entire hotel for a relatively good price.I have stayed there several times for business and lived there for 3 months during the summer of 2006.There are a few things that can be improved and i am only saying this because i wish that Almond keeps and improves its service record.A- Slippers and bathrobe in the roomB- Coffee, Sugar,Creamer and a bottle of water to be in the room upon check in. Many poeple arrive late at night for any supermarket to be open and hence it would be very nice to have at least the above mentioned basic items. This is almost standard in all hotels.C- Bigger and better TV, the current tv is very small compared to the room size. An LCD TV would go very well with the elegant rooms and would have a nicer picture quality.Notwithstanding of what i mention above, it is in my opinion the best hotel available in Nicosia and i would recommend it to any one visiting the city.",Almond Business Hotel
50,"This is the second time I stay at the Almond, coming on business to Nicosia, Cyprus, I was looking for a centrally located hotel which will also be quiet to work in and recieve business guests.The suites are lovely, roomy and have all the facilities, the hotel is totally wireless internet, lobby offers also printing, fax services. the cleaning stuf is great and friendsly and the hotel manager is more then welcoming.I also held a presentation at the hotel conference room, and the hotel supplied me with everything for the presentation, including their technical man to help set up the projector.all in all, I highly recommend the Almond....Nili Glazer, directorEDAS org.

50,"This is a great hotel. It is on a lovely, quiet street very closed to Nicosia city center and is brilliantly located for walking all round the city. I would consider Almond Business Suites as the best place to stay, as it is away from the crowded and noisy streets. The staff in the hotel are nice - very friendly and helpful. The room was perfect and big, very clean with modern design. Breakfast which was room service was a good selection of cold meats, cheese, lovely toasted bread and fruit, which really does set you up for the day. All in all, this is a definite recommendation - great location, nice spacious room, good rate, helpful staff.",Almond Business Hotel
