10,The room that i had smelled like mold. It was the rugs that they had on the floor. Cleaning service is terrible. the AC was shut off for the winter even if its 90f. The breakfast was always the same and not enough selections.,Hilton Nicosia,Review 17 Similarity,0.46291005,Review 69 Similarity,1
40,Booked an Executive room and was very impressed by the size when entering the room. Furnishings are a little old but still OK. Had the worst nights sleep ever. My room 209 was overlooking a function room. I arrived back at 12:00 AM after dinner with my business partner to hear alot of commotion outside the room and the room pounding from the music in the function room. Saying to myself this will not go on for much longer I tried to sleep but it was impossible and too late at night to move rooms. Eventually it must have finished at around 2 AM. I later found out that this was a graduation party. Next problem was that I was awoken at around 6 AM with bright sunlight pouring into the room as the curtains would not close properly. Not a good start to a business trip.Food is very good and Executive facilities also good with nice snacks and a 2 hour happy hour for HHonors and Exec room guests.Although didn't use the other facilities the pool did look very inviting. I usually stay at the other Hilton in Lefkosia and will think twice about returning here.,Hilton Nicosia,Review 622 Similarity,0.454344111,Review 81 Similarity,0.509524665

40,Stayed here for three nights in July 2016. Hotel facilities and staff are excellent. Buffet breakfast is wonderful. Unfortunately our room had a strong cigarette smell. Hotel was 'fully occupied' so we didnt have much choice. They changed our room next day and the new room was OK. Suggest they might ban smoking within the hotel as guests appear to smoke on their balconies with sliding doors left open.,Hilton Nicosia,Review 449 Similarity,0.455842306,Review 78 Similarity,0.481543412
40,Check in was great and I had an executive room on the 2nd floor facing the car park. The room was large and seemed fairly modern but the bathroom felt a little more dated but clean. I was given some water in the room on the 1st day but this was never replaced during the whole stay which seemed strange as I was in an executive room. The lounge access area was not that impressive as the menu was limited and also it was not set in an exclusive area like some hotels as it was on the ground floor near other public areas. Breakfast was good with a wide enough range although I could not tell if fresh omelettes or poached eggs could be ordered. The staff were very attentive and smiley. Only other incident was that I could not seem to park in the customer parking when the barrier was down. I did speak to concierge and they said there was a problem and I would need to get out of my car and then ask concierge to open the barrier or drive up to the front of the hotel and ask them and so then park the car. I ended up parking on the public areas and all was fine.,Hilton Nicosia,Review 362 Similarity,0.400891863,Review 176 Similarity,0.481125224
50,"I visited this beautiful hotel with my husband for our friends' wedding last week and stayed in for 5 days. Perfectly located in a peaceful area, very close to the city center, with many trees around, it is ideal for relaxation. Every single corner is perfectly decorated. The venue bar offers exceptional drinks, coffees and food, all fresh and delicious. The various facilities, gym, beauty salon, japanese and greek restaurant covered all our needs. The breakfast area was just amazing and there were plenty of best quality food options. The room was spacy, extremely clean, the mattress and pillows very comfortable! Best sleep in my life.. We could operate the room temperature as we liked. I cannot remember even one person of the staff not being helpful and willing to help with anything we asked for, from room and laundry services to general pieces of information about the city. For those who would like to plan am event, there are various halls for any kind of event and people who perfectly organize all the special occasions. We enjoyed the wedding party of our friends, in a big hall, perfectly air- conditioned, with great service and delicious food! The only thing somebody could complain about is the fact that there is free wifi only into the public areas, but sitting in the luxury lobby to surf is just enjoyable, so I don't think that's a real problem..I can't wait to be back sometime soon!

10,"When you hear Hilton you expect luxury and enthusiasm!Well not this time don't get fooled by the name and the flashy sing from the outside. The room is not a 4 star hotel and definitely not 200 Euro euros per night. Our visit to Hilton park was combined with a business seminar we had at the hotel. The venue of the seminar I can say it was well organised and everything looked clean and fresh. A little bit cold outside for a smoke and no heating at all. After the seminar we went to the Reception to check in. The receptionist was bored and he didn't give us any information at all, not even about breakfast time. He's concern actually was that we were 2 girls and there was a king bed in the room, and he said that with the offensive way. He gave us the keys to the room in a small envelop that my grandfather use when he attends to weddings. Well we had something to laugh about but that ended when we enter our room. No balcony,both of us were smoking. We called Reception and the bored receptionist said that the hotel was full and there were no rooms with balcony available. We checked online and there were many rooms available and there was no people in the morning. Next to that the bathroom is old and I had the feeling i was in a hostel or a campus. Around the drain of the bath there was rast and the bath towels looked old and overused. The room was very big but with old furniture which were just repainted. I wanted to leave but my friend was tired so as I and we decided just to sleep to rest and leave early in the morning. Tip check the mini bar when you first go to your room, there was a used milk bottle which I mentioned it to the morning receptionist and reassured me it shoulshouldn't be like that.Fist and last time am visiting this hotel.

As a HH Diamond member I always receive an upgrade on arrival, however, on this occasion I did not & we were given an Executive room overlooking the car park, which was a huge disappointment. However, I asked to be moved & we were provided the same standard of room 2 hours later, but overlooking the pool, which was better. I was surprised that we did not receive water in the room every day (again, this is typical for an Executive Room / HH Diamond member), however, these were the only hiccups. What I really liked about the hotel was that, as there is no Executive Lounge per se, & the hotel is utilised instead, that we received free soft drinks by the pool, as well as in the hotel bar. We also had the usual evening service in the hotel bar, which made a very nice change. The hotel breakfast was excellent, as was the food by the pool. The service from the staff is outstanding. I pay particular thanks to Alex & Andrei at the pool bar & all the ladies in the hotel bar. Also, the maître de at breakfast. I apologise for not remembering all the names. In addition, Jannis at the concierge desk was able to arrange a taxi to take us to Kyrenia for the day, stay with us & return us later that afternoon. Finally, the hotel is well located for Ledra Crossing, which was 8 Euros in a taxi each way.

Our rooms were not ready when we arrived but the staff kindly offered us a spare room to rest before we headed out to the town. (Tip: allow time for a taxi to arrive. There were none outside the hotel at midday.) Our rooms were upgraded and we were happy to see complimentary treats and wine in the rooms when we eventually got there. Nice pool view and the usual amenities (for example, I always look for two robes for two people. At many hotels I find there is one and have to call for a second when needed). Breakfast comprised a good buffet selection and friendly service. My one complaint was about poor bar service. While waiting for my party, I tried in vain to get the young folk to come over to where I was sitting. Young person acknowledged me but she never came over (sigh), although there were only three other people there having some sort of business meeting.. On the positive side, I want to thank Maria for forwarding my swimsuit to me.

I did not spend much time in my room but instead enjoyed the breakfast area, the food, the lobby and the beautiful pool area.I loved that the pool was open 24/7 so I always found a time to have a lovely refreshing swim. Also I was really happy to see that in the lobby they had a bookshelf - a simple way to make every traveller feel at home and find themselves an interesting book for a few hours.And you know what made me really appreciate this hotel - when I asked for an EU adapter from the reception, they gave me one! This is really exceptional!I was a little disappointed that they did not have a bathrobe in the room so I had to dress every time I wanted to go for a swim, but may be if I had asked them, they would have helped me.

Towels provided by the lifeguard and chair side service for food and drinks from the bar. The hotel's main restaurant was opened for breakfast each morning at 7am. You are warmly greeted by name each morning with a choice or tea or coffee and a choice of hot and cold buffet or cooked to order breakfast choices. Plenty for everyone including those with allergies; some of the best gluten free bread I've had in a long time.The choice of other eateries in the hotel were okay but got tired after 3 weeks in the same place and with the hotel being about 15 mins by car from the city centre there was little local choice. There are 3 restaurants; Japanese, Greek and the bar restaurant, all of which have plenty of tasty choices if allergies were not a problem. I used room service too which was the same menu choices and the bar food - limited choice for me (gluten and dairy free) but what there was was very nice indeed. The staff in all restaurants were more than able to help with menu choice and allergy choices.The rooms were clean and fully air conditioned (windows could also be opened if preferred) with very comfortable beds and pillows.

There are now three restaurants available, the hotels own and two attached ones (which may be on a franchise): an informal Japanese/Oriental one; and an ersatz Greek 'ouzeri', that serves up ample and interesting meze (small dishes - but don't order more than 2-3 per person). We also had a chance to try the gym, which is excellent - there an instructor on hand; flavoured water, fruit and even chocolate brownies to hand! The rooms are large, the beds comfortable and storage ample, including a safe large enough for a large laptop. As before, breakfast is excellent and the staff friendly, attentive and efficient. On reporting a malfunctioning bulb, it was replaced within four minutes - where else do you get service like that? The only glitch we came across was that it was unusually cold in Cyprus and although the heating in the room itself was fine, this being Cyprus, there was no specific heating in the bathroom, which was cooler than the bedroom. The hotel is about two miles from the centre of Nicosia so if this is where you are heading for daily you will need a taxi (not sure if the hotel offers a shuttle).",Hilton Nicosia,Review 365 Similarity,0.490990253,Review 30 Similarity,0.361157559

The staff are friendly and polite, the breakfast buffet and service are excellent.However having stayed for 5 nights, 2 of which were disturbed with loud banging and knocking in the early hours, combined with the noise from the renovations during every day, it made our visit far from relaxing. Additionally there was no peace at the lovely pool due to loud (bang, bang) music being played by the bar staff. There were no quiet zones outside where the dreadful music did not disturb also drilling and loud sounds from the building work continued throughout our stay.As a result, we feel Hilton Park Nicosia did not deliver on its promise of a good nights sleep despite the “serenity bed” in our executive roomThe only other surprising thing which I found in our room was the lack of a dressing table and a mirror for doing hair and make up. There was no where to plug in a hairdryer near to a mirror and nowhere to sit near to a mirror whilst making up.Also we did not receive any complimentary fruit or water in the room until we pointed out it was missing.Finally one of the lifts was out of order throughout our stay.We have written to the General Manager for comment but so far, no response.",Hilton Nicosia,Review 62 Similarity,0.412393049,Review 142 Similarity,0.360667854

Specially liked the room with the balcony.Rooms are nice and spacious.Always cleaned well.First check in was done by a young gentleman who unfortunately didn't say much about the hotel and the whole process was kinda off.Second check in was done by the same girl who checked me out after my first stay and it was lovely. She already remembered my name and made me feel welcomed (wish I remembered her name- glasses and shoulder-length light hair).Breakfast was good. Specially liked the attentive breakfast hostess who made sure not only breakfast but the whole stay was going well (once again can't remember the name but she had long dark hair).Pool area very nice but the service around the pool area and the pool bar just terrible!! Not even once someone came up to me by the pool to ask if there was anything id like to have. I didn't really notice them going to anyone else either.When I went to the bar myself had to always wait til someone actually asked that what I wanted (they did notice me but were too lazy to bother). This really pissed me off to be honest when there is 5 people ''working'' but they are just chilling at their phones and having a chat with each other rather than making the hotel some money.Gym was nice, not too big, but managed to do everything I needed.Specially enjoyed the bar in the lobby floor. Went there every evening.Girls working there were just super ( so were the cocktails they made) and really made our evenings.After couple of days they already knew what we were going to order.If there I also recommend to have the seafood pasta- it was amazing (big thanks to the girl working at the bar for recommending it).Location is okay if you are okay just enjoying the pool area and visiting the old town and border area.

Our limo-driver was arranged via Hilton Front Desk Mgr-Mr. Pambos S.- and was waiting for us !Highy advisable IMHO to arrange taxi via Mr. Pambos for pick up and return to Larnaca Airport as this guarantees reliable driver and correct price ( paid 55 euro LCA-Nicosia and 50 bck to LCA).Drive takes about 40 minutes from LCA airport to Hilton Park Nicosia .Hotel is located in quiet residential area , road in front of parking area does not create disturbing noises during night so even in room facing road sleep is not disturbed .On arrival at hotel :Entrance hall and large lobby are clean , airy and nicely designed. Good first impression ;)) No OLCI nor on line choice of room possible before arrival .Check in proccess on arrival at 02:00 AM was very efficiently done by very friendly staff member! We had received pre-approved upgrade as HH Diamond members but night receptionist really made us feel welcome and appreciated !!Second impression got even beter as there is a bell service present 24/7 and Yannis took us upstairs to our exec. room #205 !!Bell service was fast and informative for services in the hotel ... We requested delivery of international english newspaper- NYTimes- in mornings to room but only Cyprus Newspaper in English is available on site ; NYT is to be purchased by guest accross the road at off site newsstand .Room : executive room had nice lay out, 1,5 bath plus bedroom. We could easily unpack and store our clothing in cupboard with sliding doors , lots of hanging space and 3 drawers as well .Inside cupboard there is also safe as well as usual mini bar .Exec. Lounge :in all our Hilton stays as HH Diamonds this is first time that an Exec. Lounge -which is confirmed on Hilton website for this hotel -is actually not an enclosed lounge area with restricted key access . It is IMHO fantastic that managment here decided that Diamond / exec level guests at this Hilton can order without charge any non-alcoholic drink during the day or night in Amalfi Lounge Bar as well as outside at Sorrento Pool Bar !!From 6 til 8 pm there is also free-pour for alcoholic drinks which are to be served by staff from bar.There is no self-pour for alcohol as is usual in most European EL's but we do not drink any alcohol so did not try the ""happy hour"" .Choice of EL food :This is the only minor point we had during our entire 6 night stay :Executive Lounge Breakfast is only served in Olympia restaurant buffet style (plse read my review of Olympia Restaurant on Tripadvisor for my comments on breakfast buffet )There is a menu in Amalfi Lounge Bar with special page for EL guests which is presented instead of usual EL offerings.This menu provides only 4 cold choices : plate with cheese , plate with meatcuts , mixed plate with meatcuts and cheese or plate with smoked salmon . There is also a small plate with sweets as dessert.There is no usual EL ""Afternoon Tea"" serving sweets (cakes, pies..) nor savoury sandwiches between 3 and 5 pm . After we mentioned this to several members of staff Mrs Eleni Z., executive housekeeper ,offered us savoury sandwiches and fruitplates which we received on wednesday and thursday afternoon at 5 pm.This exec. lounge is also sadly missing the usual choice of hot food,salads ,sandwiches ,bread,fruits etc offered between 6 and 8:30 pm in a regular exec. lounge at other Hilton's and according to Hilton standards .This adds about 30 -50 euro per day to the budget, paying for dinner for 2 .We have paid in Amalfi Lounge Bar for our own club sandwich and philly cheese steak sandwich on our last night as we were fed up going out to eat our dinner in restaurants around the Hilton ! Both items were delicious, very well prepared by the kitchen staff !It is a shame that the GM does not yet offer these and other hot food items on a daily, rotating base to his EL guests who choose to stay at the Hilton Park Nicosia instead of the Hilton Nicosia. The other Hilton in Cyprus however does have a full EL with afternoon tea and with evening food offered according to Hilton EMEA Guidelines!The lack of normal Executuve Lounge food choice for the Diamond /executive level guests is the ONLY reason this Hilton Park Nicosia does not get a perfect 10/10 - or higher- score from us .We can only hope that the GM , Mr. Evros S. , and Louis Group as Hilton franchise holder, does tweak the food offerings in the EL a bit before our next stay in September ;))Pool area : big , well kept pool with life guard on duty from 09:30 till 6 pm .Lifeguard also provides the bathing towels to Hilton guests so if you swim before or after the hours that a life guard is present you have to take towels from the room !Non-guests pay their entrance fee to these life guards who seems to have a hotel room list with names of residing hotel guests. We guess that last week about 85 % of the daily pool guests were locals from outside the hotel but there was always enough room to swim and sunbathe without any problems.Bar service is at Sorrento Pool Bar : we went to the bar for our order and carried it ourselves to our chairs , the staff is friendly and seem mostly to be seasonal workersHousekeeping :in one word : FANTASTIC !

It was her daughter's christening. This stay at the Hilton was so luxurious. The hotel was fabulous. The staff were wonderdul and so helpful and genuinely kind. The breakfast buffet has everything you can imagine from Cypriot delights to English cuisine to French to German you name you have it and me being vegan.. they catered and looked after me so so well. I cannot thank them enough.My room was huge and the bed was so magnificently comfortable I want to live in it. The room was big and I had a great view from my balcony. The room itself was cleaned daily and cleaned.. well.. it was spotless. The hotel is spotless. I really cannot recommend this venue to stay enough. Hilton-be proud of your staff here from the reception staff to the catering and hospitality to the cleaners.. they are equally respected by me at a high level. You should be proud. What a wonderful stay. What a wonderful place and so close to local amenities and the centre.

30,"The staff members we encountered were universally friendly and helpful. Thanks to all concerned. We chose this hotel because of its close proximity to a social event that we were attending next day. The allocated room was very warm (30C) and when we attempted to use the air conditioning it became worse. The hotel staff pointed out that during the winter months only heating is available, irrespective of the heating/cooling selector on the air conditioning controls. Presumably during summer months only cooling is available. The situation was resolved by selecting OFF on the air conditioning controls and throwing open the balcony doors. We ate in the bar and were pleasantly surprised by the corn soup and the brie and roast vegetable toastie. The scope of the menu was fine but the prices looked rather steep even when compared with prices at tourist traps elsewhere in the city. As with other Hilton Hotels, the bed was firm but just on the acceptable side of too hard. The breakfast spread was extensive but local produce and cooking techniques did not make this a particularly enjoyable meal.",Hilton Nicosia,Review 659 Similarity,0.5,Review 25 Similarity,0.3086067

Big, clean and very shiny - but this one could have been anywhere in the world.I had hoped that being in Cyprus, there might have been even just a few local dishes on the menu, but the Hilton Burger I had for dinner was identical to the Hilton Burger that I had in Birmingham UK and every other Hilton I've stayed in. As far as I could see, apart from a token Greek Salad, there was nothing on the menu that said I was in Cyprus. Having said that, breakfast was superb, with more fruit than you could ever hope for anywhere.I'm not complaining at all, because the quality, attention to detail and service were all outstanding. The bed was comfortable, the room was huge and everywhere was immaculately clean and tidy. The Spa was superb and the outdoor pool is huge.Best of all - the staff were some of the best I've ever met anywhere in the world - friendly, efficient and attentive.I will definitely stay here again, but please add a few 'local touches' so that I know I'm in Cyprus.Thank you to all the staff who were so friendly.",Hilton Nicosia,Review 703 Similarity,0.377964473,Review 212 Similarity,0.306186218

Its situation is perfect, especially if you are driving a car, because is just a 10 minute ride from the center of the city and there is also free open parking.The old building is successfully refurbished, and the decoration tries to combine the old with the modern. Standard rooms are quite large and nothing was missing in order to have a pleasant stay. The hall, the lobby and the restaurant are very spacious and very well decorated. Cleanliness of all premises was also an advantage. We had no important negative issue concerning our stay.Breakfast was perfect, with a large choice, as well as some snacks we have tested.As regards some improvements needed, firstly I have to say that there are not anymore hotels, even of lower class, which continue to charge the internet access. It is free everywhere. Further, as the insulation of rooms against the noise is not very strong, it would be useful to install a second door between the main room and the entrance door. Lastly, although the price of the room was reasonable, drinks offered at the bar are rather expensive.As an overall result, we were satisfied from our stay.

And believe me- I have tried a handful of Japanese restaurants in many cities.Cons:Off-center - If you want to stay in the heart of town the Hilton Nicosia Park isn’t really the place. It's about 10 minutes ride from there. Nevertheless, the center of Nicosia isn't really a typical city center. It's very small and sluggish, and in many aspects, you'll find the hotel and it's surroundings more lively.",Hilton Nicosia,Review 571 Similarity,0.433460723,Review 113 Similarity,0.261116484

The weekend rate was attractive, so I did a little research and booked with the Hilton Park Nicosia. I wasn't disappointed.When I arrived, the front desk was efficient and friendly. They even let me check-in to my room early (I arrived at 09.00). The room was decent with modern decor and a huge TV (although not many channels in English). My room was fairly standard sized although it had been updated and had a balcony. The bathroom was spacious and the with modern fixtures. And the bed was definitely comfortable - I could have slept for hours more in it.The Hilton Park Nicosia facilities were assiduously maintained and the inside of the lobby was large, bright from natural lighting, and had plenty of seating. There was no executive lounge at the hotel, so they accommodate diamond and gold members there. There is a special executive menu you can order in lieu of the typical exec lounge offerings. Drinks are free for the diamond and gold members from 6pm-8pm/18.00-20.00. The hotel lounge was just like the lobby: lots of natural light with modern decor. The seating was comfortable and the staff were quite attentive. In addition, diamond and gold members get free breakfast in the restaurant, which is quite good (lots of choices and everything is fresh). Just like the lounge, the restaurant staff were all efficient and hospitable.If I had to knock the Hilton Park Nicosia half a point, it would be on location. It is not within walking distance to the old town or most of the tourist attractions. There also aren't many restaurants in the immediate area. The hotel does have ample free parking, so that was never a problem (just be prepared to drive on the wrong side of the road there). All in all, I give the Hilton Park Nicosia a solid 4.5 stars.

The room (standard) was ample, the bed comfortable and the storage plentiful. The bathroom was on the small side but well laid out - so no problems. Breakfast was excellent and could be taken inside (air-conditioned) or on the terrace, surrounded by pleasant gardens. The staff were friendly and were quick and gracious in dealing with a small error in the bill. The swimming pool looked very inviting but, alas, we did not get a chance to use it. There is also a gym although the opening hours are a little limited, especially over the weekend. The entrance road to the hotel is easy to miss. The only slight niggle we had was some noise caused by a member of staff re-arranging outside tables at 5 AM - but we had been sleeping with the windows open.

If you have a room in the floors above the entrance hall it could get quite noisy at nights on weekends!

Never have seen a cooling for the meat / chees etc. on a stone. The pool is very big and some days very crowded as the locals come and use it but to mention is that they are very friendly and respect everyone, and again maybe only on weekends. What surprised me the most of the pool is that the edges of the water overflow was made out of stone and not cheap plastic where most people hurt themselves! Next to the pool is a big bar where you can drink and also eat some snacks over the day. The Staff is very helpful and always smile and talk whenever they see you.

Lunch was lovely.My only negative comment would be the lack of complementary refreshments in the rooms. In hotels of this rating I would normally expect something, e.g. a bottle of water and some snack.

The lobby style and shared areas have a nice, classic look and style. But there are several chinks in the armor which tarnish the experience. Communication with the hotel prior to arrival concerning the existence of an airport shuttle was never answered, even to this day. (The only option is a €50 cab ride). The room was clean, but felt very 1990. The heating unit only blew cold air, and did not heat up. The bathtub is extremely narrow, and very difficult to take a shower in. Every time I boarded the elevator, there was an ever present sewer smell. The bed was rock-hard to the point where my back still hurts. There was a closed sign on the pool every day. When I asked about it at checkout, I came to find out that it was only closed for ""non-guests"" because it lacks a lifeguard in the early months of the summer; this fact was not very apparent. Overall, the staff seemed to try hard to resolve issues and be very helpful, but it was hard to overlook some of the little things that made the stay a challenge.",Hilton Nicosia,Review 314 Similarity,0.370624658,Review 219 Similarity,0.160128154

At check-in we discovered that I had reserved rooms for December as opposed to November, but the check in agent was helpful and assured us that this will be fixed and we’ll only have to pay the difference, if there is a difference in price. Thankfully the process didn’t take long and we got to our room in no time.The rooms were clean and comfy. The bathroom, though small, included the essential. We asked for extra soap twice.We opted for the breakfast buffet and it was nice and eclectic. There was a section that included traditional Cypriot food like olives, pastries, halva, etc.I thought the hotel was well located, though it was 15 minutes away from the conference center that I had to attend. There’s a McDonald’s right next to the hotel, a mega supermarket a little further, and if you keep walking there’s a Papa Johns Pizza and a Jamie Oliver restaurant. There are also coffee shops and restaurants across the hotel. We didn’t try any of those food outlets but rather opted to dine at the hotel. We had dinner once at a Cypriot/Greek restaurant attached to the hotel (you need not go outside as there is a door from inside) and on the third night we tried the Asian/Japanese restaurant also at the hotel.

10,"I had a 6-months membership in Hilton Park Nicosia - I terminated it after 4 frustrating months. The gym is nicely equipped, the problem is the pool area. The staff plays blasting, Ibiza night club-style music all day long around the pool, starting from the morning, even before they open. They made sure they have enough speakers around, no escape. When you ask them to lower the volume, they ignore you completely. I addressed this at the reception desk, I got a lot of rolling eyes and a standard answer (probably I will receive for this review as well), 'thanks for bringing this to our attention, we will have a meeting with the staff'. The next day, next week, everything is the same, loud music, ignored by the bar staff. When I e-mailed them about the same, they never answered my e-mail although they read it 53 (!) times - thanks gmail mailtrack -, only after I sent a reminder that I am waiting for an answer. The answer was meaningless, 'thanks for bringing it to our attention ... '. At the end I moved my membership to The Landmark and I am happy there, the Staff is professional and they have a good idea about customer expectations. Please note, I never stayed in any of their room in Hilton Park Nicosia, I only had a membership and visited the place daily for 4 months until I gave up. Perhaps the rooms are nice and the beds are comfy - and if your room does not have a window to the pool or you can ignore the loud music, I am sure you have a chance to relax in the rooms. Location is mediocre, it is definitely not 'in the heart of Nicosia' as they advertise it - don't take my word for it, google maps will tell you. The center of the city is indeed close enough, after all the city is a small city with 250.000 residents - like Chandler in Arizona or Norfolk in Virginia - so how far anything can be? The Landmark is in the city center, or Cleopatra is even closer to the center, I recommend those ones before Hilton Park. But again, if you are 20 years old on Spring Break, you love loud music and you believe sleeping is overrated - well, in that case, Hilton Park Nicosia is for you.",Hilton Nicosia,Review 24 Similarity,0.28827833,Review 383 Similarity,0.113227703

The beds and linens were great, the room size was generous and had lovely views of the pool and surrounding area. The wi-fi could be much better, not acceptable in this day and age.My favourite part was the outside area. A large pool interspersed with tree and flower sections was very pretty. There were plenty of beds available although when we arrived mid Friday afternoon, most loungers and their accompanying tables had left over cups and glasses from previous guests. It was very warm but the sky was looking stormy so not many guests were outside - hence the pool staff would have had time to put in some housekeeping activities! Disappointing. However, the next day was bright and sunny and all the areas were well prepared and attended to regularly. There is a shaded children's pool with a guard attending at all times. The outside bar is very pleasant with cocktails and a variety of drinks available plus good quality light meals. Plenty of shade available if the weather's too hot. The salads were excellent. An area off to one side (away from the pool area) was being prepared for a wedding. It was beautifully laid out and all the gardens around, well manicured.The lobby area is large and airy and the staff pleasant. Apart from the pool area, we didn't eat or drink at the hotel, preferring to go to local Cypriot places.The hotel is approx 40 mins transfer from Larnaca airport. There are eating and drinking establishments a walk away from the hotel but many more are but a taxi ride away. We had two meals nearby in local Cypriot eateries with great service and delicious food.It was too hot to go to the old town, next time perhaps.

This was an excellent example of making things right, and he always gave me a sense of being noticed and valued in every interaction.I am always recommending this hotel to family, friends, and members of Diamond and Gold Hilton forums as being my favourite hotel. It certainly didn't disappoint, and so I stayed an extra night.

Additionally, in my one month there looking over the pool from my rooms balcony...I had never once seen the pool inside or the sunbeds floor being cleaned.The rooms are unacceptable for a Hilton property even considering the term Park added to it as a sign of low quality.The staff working at the Hotel is fantastic!!!!Breakfast Buffet is very limited.The restaurants within the property are both good but Ellinikon is fantastic.

50,"I have been travelling to Cyprus for many years on business and have stayed in any number of hotels as well as being a long standing member of the HH program with Hilton. In many years of travel I have received the highest level of upgrade and recognition of my membership at this hotel in recent stays. The beds are great as usual in a Hilton and breakfast wide ranging. You can argue that some of the standard rooms have seen better days but overall the facilities are great including one of the best gyms i have come across in any hotel, with any brand in 15 years of travel. Good pool, friendly staff, good location with a short drive into the center. I have also stayed at the Hilton Nicosia on several occasions and while that hotel has the same facilities and a dedicated exec lounge I enjoyed the overall experience more at the Park which often has slightly better pricing. There is now a kind of exec lounge which is part of the bar and was previously missing from the hotel but it is a bit confusing as to what is on offer compared to other standard lounges. I suggest this should be made clear at check in or by the staff/notice in the bar on arrival to avoid any confusion. Paid WIFI is still an issue at Hilton hotels but if you are a member they are now offering it for free. Maybe the chain will wake up to the fact that all guests expect this in any hotel as standard these days but that is their corporate decision and not that of the individual hotel of course. In short I would thoroughly recommend this hotel over any other I have stayed at in Nicosia for business travellers or tourist stay in the city.",Hilton Nicosia,Review 582 Similarity,0.417312425,Review 138 Similarity,0.055300126

The two Hiltons are the only decent hotel options if you have to stay in Nicosia and both are equidistant to my office.What grinds my gears the most is that I must have stayed in both hotels probably 25 nights now and yet they never even acknowledge my previous visits.The Hilton Park is a reasonable 3 star with the plus side of a decent but busy gym.
