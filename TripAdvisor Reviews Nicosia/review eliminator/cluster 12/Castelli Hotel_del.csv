The hotel is a small hotel with very helpful staff as they gave me and my partner great tips of what to see in Nicosia and where it is worth of going to!!!

30,This hotel was cheap at <60 per night (we just stayed for one night). The room was small and had very few lights installed. The bed was ok. The cleanliness was average and the same for the breakfast. Also there is a very small parking nearby which was full so we had to park somewhat far. The location of the hotel is central but not the safest in Nicosia during the night. The personnel was polite.

Thought the breakfast selection was also very good, lots to choose from and attentive service. Staff were friendly and when we had a problem with the safe, he promised to sort it out, which he did. Beds are comfortable and the rooms clean. TVs could do with updating as they're not flat screens. Hotel is in the city walls and very convenient for exploring the old town.",Castelli Hotel,Review 66 Similarity,0.492832883
40,"We stayed at this hotel for one night last week whilst on an overnight visit to Nicosia. I have to say that some of the previous reviews on here do not match with our experience. Perhaps we were lucky but based on our experience I thought there were many positives:- central location- the staff we met - receptionists, night porter and breakfast waitress - were all very friendly and spoke good English- a quiet, clean room on the third floor with good soundproofing which blocked out most of the noise of the city- comfortable bed- effective air conditioning- good bathroom with powerful shower and plenty of hot water- excellent wifi which we didn't have to pay for- reasonable choice of hot and cold food on the breakfast buffet, even at 9.00 when we went for breakfastI would agree that the hotel would benefit from a refreshed décor and some of the public areas do look a bit tired. On a minor point, the TV in our room - although modern and flat screen - had very few channels. The only English language channel was Bloomberg Business which quickly became boring to watch. The other channels were 3 local ones in Greek and Aljazeera in Arabic.However, overall I thought that for the amount we paid (about £50 sterling), the hotel offered excellent value for one night's stay in a central location and I would certainly consider staying there again if we were in Nicosia for another overnight visit.",Castelli Hotel,Review 61 Similarity,0.488454654
30,"I stayed for two nights during a business trip - I had originally planned to stay in The Classic Hotel across the road but this was fully booked. I had a standard room and, although the room was spacious with a large double bed, the furnishings were extremely dated and in need of refurbishment (poor quality tv, mould in/around bathroom fittings, threadbare towels). The colleague I travelled with encountered the same in her Executive Room so I think this may be the case in other parts of the hotel as well. That said, the room was relatively cheap and the staff were very friendly. I only ate breakfast at the hotel but there was a good choice of hot/cold options available in the restaurant. In all honesty, if I were staying longer than two nights I would look for another place to stay, but if you're on a budget and a short break in or around Nicosia then The Castelli will meet your needs.",Castelli Hotel,Review 55 Similarity,0.488071101

20,"The hotel is well situated to the centre of old Nicosia, old and in need of renovating. Things look dated and the rooms need painting to cover the marks on the walls, the chipped wood, etc.The room was clean, but when you get a ""superior"" room, you do not expect a connecting door to the next room where you can hear the other people in that room even when they whisper. Unlike other hotels, there was nothing in the room - no tea/coffee making facilities, no water, nothing.WiFi in the room and throughout the hotel worked OK if not very fast.Breakfast was OK, but very standard (typical eggs, beans, bacon, sausages, cereals, etc.), but nothing out of the ordinary or even nice.When got a water from the machine in the hallway it was very warm (temperature outside was over 30C) and had to argue with the receptionist to get a cold bottle of water - ""sorry, not our machine"" is what she said over and over again.The hotel is in located on a VERY busy and noisy road and in front of a fire station and police station so expect to be woken up at 7am when they test their sirens at the fire station and because of the general noise of that street.When got back after midnight the keycards did not work - either of them - so that meant a trip to reception only to be told that as it was after midnight on the day we were leaving, they didn't work - even though we had another 12 hours at the hotel. Receptionist didn't even apologise.The notice in the lift (see photo) was a bit insulting - bad comments and reviews were because of the ""emotional state"" of the guests? No sorry - bad reviews are because of the very average service, the old furniture, average food, argumentative receptionists, etc.Overall, it was just about ""OK"" with nothing special at all. It is not somewhere I'll come back to.For the money I paid, I expected better and could have got better.",Castelli Hotel,Review 16 Similarity,0.475655698

However my recent stay was a very bad experience, The room was far from clean and had a stink of smoke , the shower screen leaked water, the delph was unwashed from the last guest. there was no milk. When this problem was brought to the attention of reception no action was taken The electricity in the room cut out on a regular basis. The toilet flush did nor work properly.It strikes me that standards have dropped off.

Our room this time was superb, complete with a settee and two easy chairs. There is a very good selection at breakfast, catering for all tastes. The waitress was extremely helpful and attentive. Although not 'The Ritz', the Castelli is good value for money and an excellent base for going into Occupied Cyprus and also to Ledra Street, etc.",Castelli Hotel,Review 115 Similarity,0.466173237
30,"We stayed here for 2 nights in June Firstly I have to say the receptionist was very helpful we had booked a superior room with a balcony and were given a nice room but with a small window looking at walls? We went back to reception and informed them that we had booked for a balcony room and fair enough she found us one with no problem, No kettle again in room and the prices to get coffee etc brought to your room were astronomical luckily I always take a travel kettle with me and the wherewithal to make a cuppa. The hotel was spotlessly clean and most of the staff very friendly we tried to book a table at the Polynesian Restaurant in the hotel (this was advertised in the hotel bumph in the room) just to be waived away and told No No Not doing it Not Open???? Why advertise it then.. The room we were given was opposite the fire and police station but please do not let this put you off as we heard nothing when the windows/doors were closed and even when sat on the balcony there was not really any disruption at all they kept the sirens/bells to the absolute minimum and after all they have an important job to doBreakfast was however faultless very good help yourself and staff pleasant. My opinion is good hotel for business customers not so great for holiday makers really no downstairs space & no garden/patio area to sit in",Castelli Hotel,Review 85 Similarity,0.462938655
30,"I recently stayed in the one of the Executive Rooms at the Castelli Hotel, after being advised by the receptionist at the nearby Holiday Inn that the rates were cheaper the rooms were the same. In fact the Castelli Hotel shares some of the Holiday Inn perks (i.e. the pool, spa area and even the room menus are Holiday Inn) as they are owned by the same company. But if the Holiday Inns air conditioning was as weak as the Castelli I am glad we didn't pay the extra - we had it on the whole time we were there and I would say that the morning when we left (just an overnight visit to Nicosia) was just getting down a nice 18-20°. Needless to say our nights sleep was sticky in the 35°+ heat of late July.The staff were lovely and the breakfast was great . Full cooked English and Continental style also. The food menu in the room also looked good. As is normal in Europe, no tea/coffee facilities were available in the room, although there was a coffee bar on the ground floor.The bathroom was clean and well stocked. But it has to be said that the room had a worn look about it, with dusty, shabby, hanging off curtains and the lamps by the bed look like they had coffee spattered all over them. The TV channels only had news in English - but a selection of other Greek channels available.For 100 Euro in the city centre, its OK - if you ask to see the room first then you should make a decision. If you're there to see a bit of Nicosia for a night its not too bad - but I am unsure if I would want to pay this rate for a week with the shabby state of the room itself.",Castelli Hotel,Review 106 Similarity,0.457667411

Distance between the two hotels is app. 200 meters so it's convenient to use the spa, swimming pool, fittness centre and other services of Holiday Inn.Castelli is not fancy but for regular travelling it's sufficient. Rooms are clean and comfortable, breakfast is what you expect from this grade hotel, if not a bit better. City centre is within walking distance. There is a good service of wifi coverage in Castelli, though you have to pay 6€ to use it for 24 hours, though the time does not count from the first login, since it is 24 hours of online time within 7 days.You can smoke in room but not at the lobby.",Castelli Hotel,Review 90 Similarity,0.456014593

10,"I was fortunate I didn't book this hotel myself (so, I didn't have to pay for my stay); I was brought here by a company that booked/paid it for me.It's the worst experience I've ever had. I should have known better, when I called to confirm my stay and spoke to the Hotel Director. She had a bit of a difficulty to find the name of the booking, but ended up laughing at my worries of whether the booking was valid or not.Nevertheless, I didn't pay much attention. I came yesterday and when I went up to the room, I found a room filthy at all levels (pictures uploaded for all below observations):1) the floors were sticky,2) there was dust everywhere on the furniture,3) the TV cable was hanging from the wall (its not only a matter of aesthetics, believe me!),5) there was rust on various spots on the W.C.,6) the toilet's flush was kind of broken,7) the ceiling was broken - missing a spot that you could not only see the cables on top of it but also listen to the next room's tenant!8) thd sheet had cigarette burns!9) BUT worst of all, the toilet and the towels were dirty, with yellow spots underneath the washes the towel has undergone... and I know this because such towels I dont even use at home for mopping the floor or as a toilet mat!!! They were torn, overwashed and overused and dirty....9) As if all above wasn't enough, I called the reception to provide me with new ones. After 20 minutes a woman came with 2 bath towels saying that they dont have any facial towels and asked me to give her back all of which I had. When I didnt give her back my bath towel, but only the facial ones, she said: ""Oh ok, then I'll give u just one, you don't need 2!"".I was practically ready to scream at her about this and all the other stuff, but I tried to think calmly understanding that there was no point. The premises do not reflect to Cyprus hospitality nor to 2016's hotel standards.If I was a Hygiene Inspector I would have locked the placed down immediately.

The aesthetics of the rooms are quite average, and the sound proofing between rooms are not that great, but if you just need a place to stay for a short while its really not that bad. The morning and evening buffets are really good, its difficult not to over eat, haha. The hotel is also situated very close to the main street and markets and the border to the Turkish side is also just walking distance away. I haven't stayed in other hotels in Cyprus so I can't really compare it with whats around. My opinion is just what I have experienced back home in Namibia and South Africa.Ps. I am not sure if it is just the exchange rate not in my favor, but doing laundry at the hotel is soooo expensive so pack enough clothes or make some sort of plan B ;)",Castelli Hotel,Review 33 Similarity,0.446418222

The air-condition doesn't works at all. Only made noise and no cold air!! It was a very warm day at Nicosia, so we open the window to take a breath!! We asked reception about the air-condition, they went to our room to see it, but nothing else. We had all night the window open.

Breakfast was pretty good.Rooms were so and so. I don't mind if they're a little scruffy here and there - not everything has to be brand new and modern, sometimes there's a lot more charm in old-fashioned furnishings but in that case you have to make sure everything is squeaky clean. Unfortunately - as many others have mentioned here - that is not the case.

The receptionist I dealt with was good: friendly, helpful, polite. All the others just seemed to do the bare minimum they needed to do. I get the feeling this stems from the mico-managing hotel owner: everything has to be done his way or take a hike kind of attitude. The continental breakfast was ok.

Location was very good, 10 min walk away, area very active and safe. Free parking outside hotel.Staff at hotel were pleasant and helpful but our room was awful. It hadn't been vacuumed properly, found a clump of black hair on the carpet, we're both gray- so obviously not vacuumed well. Tub in bathroom had mould near faucet and around the edge of the glass door in tub - unacceptable when mould on glass can be dealt with so easily. Mound in grout on shower tiles as well! Every time I went into the bathroom I started to sneeze.Room is very tight, hard to get around bed, maybe 16"" between bed and wall. Weird floor. Felt like someone dug/drilled a 6"" groove down the middle to put in pipes or wires and never leveled the groove with the rest of the room, just covered it all with carpet. Thus walking on it was off kilter and felt odd. Same in section near elevator- all this on the 3rd floor.Breakfast buffet was good, but based on our room and state of flooring and bathroom, I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.

But it is what it is... I was not happy about the very first experience I got once I entered the room. It was not in the quality that they display on booking dot com website. It was not tidy, the bed had wrinkles, towels were old and brownish with stains, the washrooms had not been cleaned properly. Even the heater was not working. So I contacted the reception and by the midnight they offered me another room since it was too cold without the heater. I had to walk down and get the new key and transfer all of my stuff to the new room. It was a bigger one with a working heater... but again the cleanliness was the same! I think that was pretty normal to them, maybe because it was kind of a place where you get what you pay for. My company travel agent had booked this place maybe because it was cheap. But it isn't a good environment for a business visit especially when you have lot more stuff to focus! They didn't have irons, so I was asked to send my cloth to some external laundry, but I didn't have that much time left. I wouldn't say that this a bad place... because they have a good staff. I only would say that this is not a place where you should go when you have many other things to focus on because you might waste a significant amount of time resolving other issues such as no iron, dirty towels, no heater and no bed duvet etc. I didn't rate this place as 'poor' or 'terrible' because they have such a nice staff. I would suggest the hotel management to even that it would be fine to increase the price if they could increase the quality and cleanliness!

30,"This is a budget hotel and you get what you pay for - perhaps a bit more than you pay for to be fair. Rooms were a bite dated - old TV, dim lighting, old bathroom. That said, everything worked and the bed was comfy - although it could have done with a few more pillows, but was on my own so could monopolise the two that were on the bed. The reception service was polite and efficient and there was a nice lady in the restaurant - which had a floor that smelt quite comfortingly of a mild bleach smell - it was really clean - and freshly cooked and very decent breakfast food. Nothing supersonic, but it was a rally good price, so overall good value solid city centre accommodation. If you are on a tight budget then very fair option.",Castelli Hotel,Review 58 Similarity,0.291294928

Check-in was easy, the room was large, clean and well furnished, and the location was just a 5 minute walk from the main shopping/restaurant street. Very nice!",Castelli Hotel,Review 60 Similarity,0.281126765

40,"We got SO lost in Nicosia. So we finally found this road with three hotels on it. Picked this one because they had their own parking. Receptionist was pretty unfriendly but we did get upgraded to a pretty nice room - so we´ll let her off. Reception were really unknowledgable about North Nicosia and North Cyprus in general. Didn't even know the area code for a phonecall...... Internet here is really expensive. Something like 6 euros for an hour. Bed was comfy as, view was of nothing. Breakfast was pretty nice, waitress was real friendly. No swimming pool, gutted!!! Close to town and an internet centre nearby that is waaaay cheaper, it´s not a bad place!!!",Castelli Hotel,Review 108 Similarity,0.277136998
40,"Had a one night stay at Castelli on a quick tourist visit to Nicosia. I had a rental car so I needed a place with parking, and not many city centre hotels can claim their own protected parking area. Parking involved parking in front of the barrier and then running in to ask them to lift the barrier (might be better if there was an intercom, but it was easy enough).The Greek check-in guy was funny and friendly and chatty. Check-in was easy and memorable.As for the room. The bed and the bathroom were fine. The TV only had local channels -- no satellite (unless I am mistaken). The main problem (and here it loses a star) is that the air con simply did not work. However there was a big fan in the room which kept it cool enough. Wifi was adequate.Breakfast was simple but fine.The location is great. Only two minutes walk to the main street and five minutes to the ""border"" crossing to the North.I would stay here again! It was great value pricewise for a city centre hotel with parking.",Castelli Hotel,Review 30 Similarity,0.276520452

The room size was okay for a short trip when you don't have lots of lugguage. The room was clean and had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and the air con is really quiet. Usually you have to pay for the Wifi, but we were offered the connection for one device for free.The breakfast could have been better and offer more choice. All in all, our stay was good considering the price we paid.",Castelli Hotel,Review 65 Similarity,0.269407953

It’s quite and in an amazing location.The young lady on reception couldn’t have been more helpful and despite her warning me our room was a small one we found it lovely and in our opinion not really that small. As it was late she wanted to make sure the room was ready so we left our bag in reception whilst it was checked out. Both my wife and I had a great night sleep and Cam enjoy another lovely day in the capital city. Will come back for sure and hope to book in just before Christmas for some shopping as the location is within walking distance of sightseeing seeing, bars, restaurants, and many places to eat. Thank you",Castelli Hotel,Review 7 Similarity,0.257603274

Internet service was both expensive and inadequate: I had to take my laptop over to the sister-hotel, the Holiday Inn down the street. Despite the warm March weather, the central air conditioning was not turned on, leaving no alternative but to open the window to cool down the room.

40,"We arrived around noon and our executive room was ready. Reception was nice and courteous. Somehow our request for a twin room was misinterpreted as a room with an extra bed, so the prepared us a double room with an extra made sofa bed. We took the sheets off the sofa bed and folded it back so we could use as a couch to sit on. The double bed was wide enough, so no problem there. The hotel has its own parking lot in front. The room was spacious and furnished with the said couch and two arm chairs, a desk and a cabinet holding the fridge, but no minibar. The furnishings were a bit outdated, the couch looked and felt a bit tired.The bathroom was very small and dificult to get in an out of. We had a room at the back, with no view to speak of. The room was quiet and we slept very well.Breakfast was ok. Both hot and cold items, quality was basic. Staff at breakfast was friendly and efficient.

Bathroom was extremely small. Air condition was functional and adjustable.Bed mattress was very soft for my liking.The worst thing was breakfast. Probably the worst breakfast I've encountered in all my travels.. Juice and coffee were terrible, ham and cheese seemed like they were frozen, bread was from a couple of days back, there was a single slice of melon for fruit and not replenished while I was waiting and finally there were ants walking all over the bench and inside the bowl of croissants.

Just a few hints for the management so they can deal with the issues rather than blaming their customers for the bad reviews:* Had to wait 10 minutes at check-in for the receptionist to finish a phone call. Afterwards she told me she was on the phone talking to her manager. Clearly she and her manager have their priorities straight (i.e. not the customer)* Room is in desperate need for refurbishment. Wood panelling on ceiling about to fall down, mattress is bumpy, walls and furniture have stains on them* Staff is not empowered to take any decisions or help customers. If you have a problem you are referred to “the manager” who is never on site* There was a colony of little brown ants having a party overnight in my bathroom and they were all over my toiletries* there is a mini bar in the room.
