With the bus station behind you cross the road (there's a light controlled crossing). Keep going straight and you are in AG Leventis Street (formerly Leonidou Street). The AG Leventis Gallery is on the right less than 100m along the road. It is just round a bend and back from the road so not visible from the street entrance.The building itself is stunning from the outside and spacious, light and airy inside.The entrance fee is an incredibly low 2Eur. I also opted for the audio guide for an extra 3Eur. It was well worth the money. The system worked perfectly and allows you to go at your own pace. The information provided is excellent.The reception and security staff are friendly and helpful.As for the collection - all I can say is go to see it. Fabulous, superb. One very unusual aspect is that you can get close enough to the artwork to see the brushwork. Also, there are white glass panels with silver buttons at the side - the art that requires special care is hung there. Press the button and the glass slides open to allow viewing. It then closes automatically.The cafe is pleasant and not overly expensive. The outside area benefits from shade and shelter from the wind.Highly recommended to while away a few hours.

Three collections, divided in three floors, my favourite being the french collection, in the second floor. I really wish the best for keeping up with such a precious heritage. Now some recommendations that were a bit bothering: guards are all over the place and come really close to the visitors creating a strangely annoying atmosphere. In all museums they remain discreetly present and do not come all over the place. Secondly the lady in the ground floor responsible for selling souvenirs from the gallery is totally rude. Two or three times she advised us not to touch the items, ok we got that in the first place but...hey chill out, you are not guarding thieves here...someone else is responsible I guess...anyway the staff should a bit more polite, especially in the reception area.
