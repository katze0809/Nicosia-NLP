Once you have crossed the border it is well signposted and takes you past many of the street vendors and their 'high end handbags'. Once inside the Buyuk Han there is a courtyard and around the edge you will find some great tourist craft stalls around the sides with a mix of quality gifts as well as some tat. There are also places to eat upstairs and on the ground floor.

Renowned puppeteer Mr. Mehmet has retired after decades of professional life and years at the Buyuk Han.

While finding our way to and inside the old town and then a safe parking was not exactly easy (no indication), the Buyuk Han, an old caravanserail converted into a handicraft and tourist centre, is definitely worth visiting (and the Selimye mosk, or former Agia Sophia cathedral, is next door). Off season there were few tourists but all the 1st level handicrafts/demonstration shop were closed. Plenty of tourist shops in the courtyard but we would recommend the Havva Senol (first shop on the left on the same side as the Sedirhan restaurant) where we had a smiling welcome and were offered coffees and seats while the owners were getting stamps for us from the post office. They spoke good English which is quite rare in North Cyprus (apart from imported staff from Asia or Africa...) and makes communication difficult.
