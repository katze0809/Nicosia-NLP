50,"Some of the reviews of Ledra Street Crossing Point on here are ridiculous and are more political statements than information for travellers. We travelled to Nicosia and were keen to experience the North of the city. Crossing from South to North was straightforward - two posts, one to leave the south, the other to enter the north. Coming back was slower coming into the south, so you might have a short queue. Each time, the border staff were friendly, and it was worth seeing the different culture in the north.

You walk through control on the south side and though we queued for a short while we were told this was unusual. There is then a walk of about 50m through the UN controlled buffer zone and no man's land to the northern control. The DMZ is fascinating in part for the shortness of the distance, but also for the flash back into history that it offers you. No photography signs abound in this area.A short queue enables you to pass into the North. Passports are scanned, but not stamped and you are granted a 90 day visa for access though most do as we did and walk around the northern area for an hour or so before returning.The North is a sharp contrast to the modern South.

It's safe and the people are friendly.The staff at the Ledra Street Border Crossing make crossing effortless.Commentary:Its really amazing how many millions of dollars the UN spends supporting this divided country.A few years ago the border got a lot easier to cross. That's partly what inspired my visit. Its technically illegal to spend money at a merchant In N Cyprus if that merchant occupies a space formerly owned by a Greek Cypriot. The thing, back in the 70s when Turkey invaded, they chased off the Greek Cypriots. The Greeks moved into refugee camps along the border, to the South. Turkey then imported people from around Turkey to occupy the north. Today many formerly Greek-owned businesses are still occupied by Turks. The Greek Cypriots consider everything on the Turkish side ""stolen.""The capital, Nicosia, is now the last remaining divided capital on earth. There's a militarized line right down the middle--just like East and West Berlin used to be.Sitting in a Starbucks on the main street in Nicosia was a great opportunity to learn more about North Nicosia. At Starbucks a local explained his family ran from the north during the invasion, and never returned. Thirty-nine years ago they left a four-bedroom, two-car-garage house on a residential street. They even left a dog in the back yard. The house was full of their food, books, pictures, dirty cloths, etc. They had no idea that they'd never be returning.The guy's mom went back about 10 years ago (when the border opened) to see her old house and shop.

As no passport, no crossing!When on the Cyprus side, I was just waved through before I had even got my passport out, then when in ""no mans land"" which is effectively a wooden shed making up a tunnel that takes you to the Turkish side, you will wait a good 10 minutes, as they do check your passport (though do not stamp it, they put your details into the computer).Pretty surreal, as for only a few yards, the difference is night and day! On the Greek Cyprus Side its pretty much the feel of the rest of Cyprus, but as soon as you pass the Turkish passport check, you suddenly get a VERY Turkish feel to the place.Seems to be that getting from Cyprus to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus takes a lot longer than on the way back, as did the return journey in just a minute or so.All in all, not as off putting as it may sound/look, and the northern quarter does have a nice charm to it and good to walk around.Watch out for customs on the way back, as I heard stories at the football match later in the day of people getting stung for import tax for taking cigarettes across the border.",Ledras,Review 25 Similarity,0.46549616,Review 66 Similarity,0.453742606

One can't drive to the other side (which must be beautiful), can't freely buy and bring back stuff to this side, get searched, has to show passports four times etc...Independent of which side one stands for, seeing barb wire fences and demilitarized zones right in the heart of Europe in 2016 is unsettling and in hindsight I regret exposing our kids to this poor show.",Ledras,Review 541 Similarity,0,Review 707 Similarity,0

Nothing but tourist tat for sale and be careful if you buy cigarettes as they will sell them to you but you will lose when you return - max 40 per person.
