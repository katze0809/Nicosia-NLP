50,"Even if all you want are a couple of photos, go and see this. The old walls, the oil barrels, the barbed.wire - all a reminder of when this town was so different. The UN.signage is still there as is "" no man's land""I didn't know about the history before but I do now and glad we went to see it",Paphos Gate
50,"The Paphos (Pafos) Gate is one of three entrances which were built into the historic Venetian walls which enclosed the old City of Nicosia The other two gates are the Famagusta Gate at the eastern end of Lefkosia, and the Kyrenia Gate in Lefkoşa, at the northern end of the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia. I have reviewed each separately, as they all warrant a visit in their own right, for different reasons.The gate, constructed in the 1560s, was so named because the road from this gate led to the coastal town of Paphos in the west of the island. If you’re within the walls of Lefkosia, walk east along Rigainis or Arsinois, past the Tripoli bastion, and you’ll come to the gate. If you are visiting the Cyprus Museum, you can’t miss the walls and the gate looming as you walk up Mouseiou from the museum. Architecturally it’s probably the simplest of all the gates - no more than an opening in the stone walls roofed by a barrel vault. It’s merely a pedestrian passage these days; part of the Venetian wall beside it was opened up to allow traffic to pass in and out of the old city. At the time of my visit you couldn’t walk completely through the gate; to see the statue of Markos Drakos and to get to the Cyprus Museum (both outside the walls), you had to follow the traffic exit.But to me it is its surroundings which make it a really interesting place to visit. It’s at this gate that the Green Line and the Venetian walls intersect, though you cannot cross the Green Line here. Entering along Rigainis you’ll see the stone walls on your left, and as the road dips, what looks like an unused observation / control box on the right. It all looks a bit intimidating, a bit forlorn, but there is no problem continuing down the hill to the gate on the left. The intimidating feel continues as you look at the gate; there’s the graffiti-covered Paphos Gate police station on the top of the gate, and a forbidding, desolate barricade of blue and white concrete drums. Turn around, and with the entrance to the gate behind you, you’ll see the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church on your left. You can visit the church. Whilst it’s interior is fairly unremarkable, what is particularly interesting about the church is that its facade and front entrance is in Lefcosia, but the body of the church juts into the Turkish controlled occupied north. Apparently the church can continue to operate as long as the back door is kept firmly closed. As you exit the church, look to your left and you can’t miss the barricades of the Green Line.Enjoy you visit here. It’s a good insight into the reality of a divided city, And in many respects, there’s no ‘gate’ here which actually signals a unified city.",Paphos Gate
40,Paphos Gate was an interesting area to see the separation between the Greek and Turkish sides of Cyprus. It definitely seemed more fortified than other areas of separation. What I appreciated about it most was the walk from the gates to the main area of the old town. It provides a different perspective as it's mostly quiet allowing one to see the daily life of the locals.,Paphos Gate
40,"We were in Nicosia/ we were even in Kyrenia / and searched out Paphos Gate. Great piece of History with the Old City Walls still generally intact. Well worth a visit, not that easy to find .....",Paphos Gate
30,"from outside the old medieval town walls if you walk towards the city center one can see the barricades that separates the two parts of the city. there are some blue/white barrels and barb wire fences if you’re into that. otherwise a bit sad sight.no need for passport here.once you crossed from the roundabout into the center, turn right into a thoroughfare to the old actual gate.",Paphos Gate
50,As you approach Paphos Gate from outside the city walls there is a roundabout upon which is a statue of a soldier throwing a hand grenade. The gate appears to be on the Green Line and there is a good view into no-man’s land with Turkish & TRNC flags on one side of the road and Greek & Cypriot flats on the other.,Paphos Gate
50,We were in Nicosia and searched out Paphos Gate. If you start at Lora Street it is fairly easy to find with a number of Tourist Signs pointing you in the right direction. Great piece of History with the Old City Walls still generally intact. Well worth a visit.,Paphos Gate
40,We parked our car in a small private lot (€3/all day) just to the north of the gate near the auto crossing into the TRNC.Interesting for foreigners to see the Green Line dividing the city. Time has stood still. You can drive through the gate and park (limited space) in other lots for €3 or so.Also a short walk from here to the Cyprus Museum that only allows free parking for 1 hour.Take the time to walk down the ramp (inside the gate) and see the gates!,Paphos Gate
30,"Generally speaking the Old town walls of Nicosia are of main interest due to their architectural significance being a Renaissance rather complete set of walls in this part of the world. They are not always well preserved (much of the covering stone was robbed), were not completed in the first place and in many parts are rather neglected (especially in North Nicosia). Those who imagine the classic vision of the charming walled city surrounded by medieval ramparts would be disappointed. The Paphos gate was recently renovated and the plaza in front of it excavated by archaeologists. One of more interesting aspects of it is the fact one can see 3 completely different type of fortifications piled up on top of each other: the foundations of the Crusador era town walls, the (complete) Venetian wall and gate (built to face artillery) and the 20th century barricades on top of both. The bastion just near the gate is part of the buffer zone and one can see the fence on top of it. If you cross to the north part (through one of the 2 Ledras crossings) you can get to the small park on top of this bastion where there is a small tea house. You can look down the Paphos gate and then within no more then 15 minutes stand at the bottomof the bastion – after crossing back to the republic.",Paphos Gate
30,Walked by the Paphos gate on our way to the Cypriot Museum. It is notable as one of the three main gates from when Nicosia was a medical walled city.,Paphos Gate
50,"When you walk through the gap in the venetian walls take a little look to your right , look further down a ramp and my son you will find what you are looking for . The gates underneath still partly clad in metal ! Go on give it a go!",Paphos Gate
50,This 'gate' is an opening and completely different from the other two actual gates. It is an opening in the Venetian Walls where a road runs through and was hard for me to find as I was looking for an actual gate. There are some remnants of the passageway also and at the time of visiting some building work was going on at the rear.,Paphos Gate
30,"Certainly not worth going out of your way to see the Gate but, depending on the route you take, it can be seen on the way to the superb Cyprus Museum",Paphos Gate
40,Just walking this city is interesting; such a mixture of old and new. And you can tell it has seen a lot of life over the years.,Paphos Gate
50,I've visited here before with my family and it never ceases to amaze me how time has almost 'stood still' when I see the green line. It brings to you how scary war can be and the impact it can have on a country. The difference between the gun shot spattered war torn areas compared with the modern aspects of the Greek Cypriot area is obvious. It gives you a view of how how life can be affected by war and how grateful I am for a country at peace.,Paphos Gate
50,Amazing as this was an entry point in to the city hundreds of years ago. Now you look straight across at the green line and Turkish Territory. The sense of history pervades. I have been staying next door.,Paphos Gate
30,"Pafos gate and the area around it is a good place to soak up the feel of how it was just after the 1974 Turkish invasion, at the bottom of one wall you are in the Greek area while on the top of the wall sits a Turkish flag, look down past the Catholic church (which opens on the Greek side but backs onto the Turkish controlled area, there are still pill boxes in abundance, including the now unused UN tower. Wear comfortable shoes and you can walk out of the city and around the wall (to the right) to the checkpoint by the old Ledra Palace hotel, you can then show your passport and walk into the Turkish area and see the whole thing from the other side. For me this particular area is more about the modern conflict than ancient history.",Paphos Gate
40,Paphos gate is one of three original gates into the walled city. Built in the Middle Ages and rebuilt over the years. Nicosia is the last divided city in the world after the Turkish illegal invasion. A problem yet to be resolved. You can walk along the old walls in many places and gardens have been developing in the old most. A great city for walking and it has a well marked tourist trail to take you past all the significant places and old buildings.,Paphos Gate
50,It's amazing to find that the old Paphos gate still exists but to the right of the present cut through the old city wall. It virtually enters under the walls and its surface has been excavated and can now bee seen. It is smaller than I thought given the size of the Famagusta gate.,Paphos Gate
40,"Newly restored Paphos Gate is basically an arch leading to a paled area with the remains of what used to be an ancient road leading to western cities. It is the smallest of the three gates of the Venetian Walls surrounding the city (alongside the large Famagusta Gate that regularly hosts festivals and exhibitions and Kyrenia Gate in the North). Paphos Gate may not look very impressive but check out its wooden doors! They look as if they were the original doors from the middle ages! Amazing!Also, the Gate is located very close to the Green Line and during the war it was definitely witnessing battles. Those military looking barrels are put above the arch and just on the right from the Gate you will see the destroyed building of what used to be a cafe used as a barricade during the war.Also, opposite there's a Catholic church which is a unique building as its front door is in Cyprus and it's back door is in the occupied territory.I believe that some research into the history of Nicosia will help appreciate Paphos Gate as a really significant monument.",Paphos Gate
50,What looks from the outside as a small structure is in fact an impressive piece of ancient architecture. Entering into the gate and knowing this was intended as a passage through the ramparts of the city will definitely make you respect the feat executed by the architects at that time.The place is often the home for cultural events and exhibits which I gladly attended during my stay last April 2015.,Paphos Gate
50,"We did a little reseach on Nicosia before our big day trip. The Paphos gate was on our have to see list for two reasons. The first being it's an entry point of the Venetian walls - one of only 3 gates, which is interesting in itself. Just outside the wall they have been doing some excavation and restoration, uncovering the old entry road - and we love a good ruin. The second is it was/is one one of the strong holds on the green line that separates the Turkish held part and The Republic of Cyprus. We are so glad we visited this site. It was definitely worth the short walk from the Tripoli parking station (opposite the Holiday Inn seems to be the most well understood directions).",Paphos Gate
40,"The Paphos gate itself is a walkway through the wall you can walk through (currently under renovation), which makes it a bit more interesting than the closed Famagusta gate. It is also a lot closer to Ledra street than the Famagusta one. But it is the area immediately around the gate that is interesting. Right next to the gate there is a section of wall which was torn down in favor of a road. One one side of the road, you would see a concrete fortress (unmanned) nestled on top of the old Venetian wall, flying the Republic of Cyprus and the Greek flags and covered with rifle ports and observation holes. On the opposite segment of the wall, you would see the TRNC and Turkish flags. You can stand between both, pretty much on the border line (which goes on top of the Venetian walls on the Turkish side). It is much more impressive that any other point I've seen on the green line in Nicosia (Ledra crossing included). The abandoned buildings nearby still carry faded signs of what they were before the war and some are also covered with gun ports. Very interesting, and a very short walk from the Cyprus Museum (which is a must!).",Paphos Gate
