50,"The brewery and it's bar/restaurant are situated in a back street and you will need a map to find it, but the effort is certainly worthwhile. A range of four core beers are served which represent the world of great beer styles: a Bohemian pilsner, a Bavarian weissbier, a Czech dark lager and an American IPA. A further beer changes regularly. At the time of my visit the featured brew was a Belgian abbey-style beer, rich and fruity. I didn't eat, but the food looked delicious, and the surroundings both in the bar/restaurant and in the rear courtyard were very pleasant.

50,An old house in the old part of Nicosia which has been converted to a brewery. Three brothers and a cousin as the young men have told us who like beer and decided to created their own brand. They produce beer on the premises. They have four flavours all very very tasty. The four young men have renovated the house with great taste having kept the character of the old city. Their idea to produce their own beer has paid off as they have done an excellent job in all respect. They also have some dishes if you are hungry. Atmosphere and service are great.

The place offers 4 different beers and all of them are heavenly. My personal favourite is Berliner Weisse (I think that's the name). They also serve quality food to accompany your drink but they will be happy to have you even if you are visiting for drinks only.The service is very friendly.The place itself is something like a fashionable bar and a simplistic pub joined together. It is not a typical cypriot place at all. When it is busy, you may have to share a table with some other guests.

I was happy to learn that each week they make a new flavoured 5th beer and that they have made Belgian styled beers as well. The only thing missing I felt was something for the ladies, I know not everyone loves the taste of beer, so having a fruity/cidery beer as an alternative would have been nice.

At the same time, there are not all these new-fashioned ""crafting"" elements such as uncouth boards in the interior or, for example, beer in old enamel mugs.Pils - wonderful, has not received such pleasure from light beer for a long time. Weitzen is sweet. The dark lager is not mine at all. Ale - interesting: the aroma of hops is powerful, but bitterness is very small; an excellent balanced.Plus to beer go cookies of spargins with salt.In general, 5 points out of 5.",Pivo brewery,Review 52 Similarity,0.212132034

50,Beer is not a usual bevarage that one finds in a back street of a historical city in Cyprus. Outside the major breweries now there is a small group of breweries crafting specialised beers. Pivo Microbrewery in the central of the Cyprus capital is a brilliant contemporary dining concept that fits well in the restored centre of old Nicosia. Superb German styled wheat or blonde beer can be drunk with a well thought out cuisine. However I would prefer the traditional Cypriot peanuts to nachos. The peanuts were introduced to Cyprus from Egypt in the twentieth century. Excellent and attentive service. They’ll even put down the music if you went there for a friendly chat. Highly recommend it.,Pivo brewery,Review 118 Similarity,0.204124145

30,"BeerThey brew their own beer and it's, on average, pretty good. Certainly worth a try. There're a couple of beers they haven't nailed their balance and taste profile, yet; a bit light, sour or bitter, especially on aftertaste.FoodAmazingly good. Except from the veg pasta and the veg pizza, very flat and uninteresting taste, although they're still edible!ServiceBrilliant except from Friday and Saturday nights. Pity, as it both subtracts from the experience and causing them lost revenue. They lack organisation.PriceIt's not cheap but if you go on a week day, get a good beer and avoid the veg dishes, it's well worth it.",Pivo brewery,Review 61 Similarity,0.188982237

30,"Food is amazing, except from the vegetarian dishes which are bland and tasteless. One could go for anything, even the sausage dish is quite good!The downside is that it being a microbrewery, one would expect better beers; they haven't yet achieved balance of taste and fragrance, bittereness is still overpowering and certain infusions end up imparting more taste than odour which usually leaves bitter and dry afternotes.",Pivo brewery,Review 41 Similarity,0.176776695

Your tastbuds will appreciate it.The staff is friendly and attentive, for questions about the beers and production processes you better talk to one of the co-owners.You're better off reserving a table as this place can get very crowded or arrive before 7pm.One of the extra questions below concerns wheelchair accessible: The downstairs restaurant and bar area is suitable for wheelchairs however the restrooms are upstairs and I didn't notice an elevator.

40,"Tried the four beer sampler (20 cl of each for 10 Euro total), as well as the Belgian IPA. I particularly liked the Hoppy, which was an American IPA, as well as the Belgian IPA, which was an interesting style that I wasn't sure was going to work. For the regular beers, the flavors are full, but not super strong and don't really last, which I initially mistook for being watered down, but then I realized that it was intentional, including the decision to keep them at around 4 to 4.5% ABV due to the hot climate. I think that at least some would have seemed overbearing if they were stronger flavored or if the flavors lingered. The beers all had a very clean taste and were very well made.",Pivo brewery,Review 50 Similarity,0.144337567

The brewery/restaurant is located in a recently renovated beautiful house in old Nicosia (within the Venetian walls). Furniture and wall fittings very tasteful. The small back yard was very cozy. Mixed crowd, young and older. We had the house burger which was very good, the fries excellent. The service was excellent and we all enjoyed Blondie one of the beers they produce on the premises. We even got a small tour of the brewery from one of the owners! We are definitely going back.",Pivo brewery,Review 133 Similarity,0.091287093

All beers freshly produced in-house, you can see the copper kettles etc.5 or 6 beers on the permanent menu and 2 to 3 special seasonal beers on offer. All of them are simply delicious!The only reason that I give 4 instead of 5 points is that they recently reduced their food menu, making it easier for the kitchen. The previous menu was really better, although the new one is not bad.Closed on Monday, opens every evening at 7pm.",Pivo brewery,Review 15 Similarity,0.077151675
