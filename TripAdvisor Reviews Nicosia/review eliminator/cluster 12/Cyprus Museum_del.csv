50,The museum is in an easy location and very easy to find. The artifacts are in excellent condition well preserved and exhibited . Going through the well aired spacious rooms of the colonial building you feel great satisfaction and awe for the beauty and historical value and toil of all who managed to put all in chronological order and harmonious perfection. I go there quote often and many a time I forget myself there.

The statue of Aphrodite of Soloi, gold relics and jewellery from the tombs of Salamis are some of the treasures worth seeing. This museum is dedicated solely to Cypriot archaeology but the findings show considerable influences and links with nearby ancient civilisations such as the Phoenicians, the Assyrians, the Egyptians, the Greeks (of course) and others. It is not very big and definitely worth a visit if you are in the neighbourhood. You can also visit other interesting places nearby such the Leventis gallery and by the end of this year, the by then finished new modern Eleftheria (Freedom) Square, the Ledra crossing point to the Turkish occupied areas and others.",Cyprus Museum,Review 176 Similarity,0.3086067,Review 143 Similarity,0

If you like stone statues and clay pots then this is the place for you!! I really like old stuff so didn't mind too much. It's was also only about 4/5 euros to get it, and it killed an hour of my time.I have to say though that the guy who sold me my ticket was exceptionally miserable and very unfriendly.

When I went a lady guide was explaining things very loudly to her clients which were noisy and annoying. Especially that group of people were blocking the way for the others in all the possible manners.
