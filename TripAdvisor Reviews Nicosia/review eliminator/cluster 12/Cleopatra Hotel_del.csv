10,"I'm not one for bad press or bad mouthing but the idea of staying here was to Try having a break away from work and lye in ,in the morning only to be woken by what I can only assume to be the cleaners making noise with there trolley at approx 07:00 , I went the bar thinking it was the dinning hall and stood there waiting to be served for food and penultimately gave up and went over the road for Wagamama as I was starving ., again for tea I had to order to my room because the dinning area wasn't pointed out and wasn't in English so just stayed in my room as I tried to get served at the bar again only to be stood there wasting time., so took long enough working the television out so downloaded Netflix on my phone and had to use that. This hotel is only probably good if your Russian , Greek Cypriot or on Business in the end I just bit the billet and came back to work with 2 days holidays needing to take. So back to the stresses of camp I went as it seemed a less stressful option than to stay another night.- later found out on leaving where the dinning hall was so if there is anyone who wants to stay here and is English please contact me and I'll gladly give u some pointers where things are.The good points where : Parking, Room Service, shower (big one)Bad points:TV- was confused and was convinced the remote was needing batteries so I asked the reception to who said they would contact maintenance and would deal with it shortly after this non existent reply I gave up and went the shop to buy some later found out you need to turn off the TV at the wall and have the patience of a saint.Small Shower : fixed into the corner and unless your pressed up against the wall is pretty pointless and frustratingTea facilities I just had Sugar and no milk , coffee or anything else to make a brew with (yes I had checked the cupboards)All in all I Was relieved to roll through the camp at UNPA (1950's camp for the UN)",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 77 Similarity,0.193649167,Review 180 Similarity,0.478091444

Angela in the office was very kind in ordering my taxi to and from the airport, which was much appreciated for a lone female traveller. The food, although not fancy, was very good, just what I wanted and extremely tasty. The service was quick and efficient. My room was fine, with an extremely comfortable bed. I was upgraded which was lovely but I would have liked more than one English speaking tv channel or at least a music channel to listen to, especially as I was on my own. I was surprised that the electric sockets took my appliances and I did not need my adapter, a really nice touch. I was disappointed that the pool was closed for winter but the free use of sauna and hot tub was lovely. There is also a well equipped gym. The hotel kindly let me keep my room on for a couple of hours on the last day as I had a later flight, with no extra charge and even sent me complimentary fruit and wine.

The hotel is mainly for business tourists but they have done a great job at making business travellers feel as if they were almost on vacation! First, the hotel is situated right in the centre of the city- close to all the main shopping areas, restaurants and business district. I only used the taxi once during my four-night stay. The hotel has its own facilities. They have a lovely gym, a restaurant with delicious greek food (let me say that it was full of locals which shows how good the food is) and a new bar. The bar is modern and relaxing. I was particularly impressed by the friendliness of the staff. The only thing that I did not like much was the lobby, which I found a bit small. But I guess the bar, which is next to it compensates for that. Other than that I was very happy with my stay and I would recommend anyone to stay there.

40,"The hotel is listed as 4 star luxury. While this is stretching it a little, (in comparison to world-wide 4 star standards), we believe that the facilities and the standards were certainly well worth the money and we would have no hesitation in staying on future visits to the city. Our initial impression was good. Reception were friendly, helpful and efficient. The rooms were clean and tidy. Unfortunately our room did smell of stale cigarette smoke, which we put down to 'guest abuse' – something that management made wish to consider for the future. Had we been staying longer than just overnight, we would have asked to change rooms. As it was, we had a number of appointments in the city, so we didn't bother on this occasion. Breakfast was the typical hot/cold buffet style. There was a reasonable selection of food on offer and what was available was fine. The lounge bar was reasonably priced and provided a good place to round off the evening.The hotel is on the borders of the business and embassy districts. The 'Old Town' is around 10-15mins walk away. During the day, apart from a few odd shops (and some expensive looking fashion shops – the type that don't have price labels on the goods), the area around the hotel is business orientated but there are coffee shops everywhere. After dark, the coffee shops close-up and the bars/restaurants spring into life. We were surprised to find quite a few appeared like magic, in the quiet side streets around the hotel. Be aware though, at weekends these get very busy and unless you book in advance (or, as we did, manage to sweet talk the staff and promise to vacate your table by 8pm), you could be disappointed. As an alternative the Old Town has a larger selection, but standards vary - as in any city.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 91 Similarity,0.395284708,Review 54 Similarity,0.285714286

50,"I've stayed at the Cleopatra several times on business over the last few years and decided it really is time to leave some feedback!This is certainly a very compact hotel and the bedrooms are on the small side. However, this minor inconvenience is outweighed by the many good points this hotel has. Although small, the bedrooms are very nicely appointed (make sure you book a refurbished room though as the others are dated and worn). The furniture is smart, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean and modern and the air conditioning is efficient (and fairly quiet when on a low setting at night).Admittedly, the small size of the room (and balcony) means that you won't want to spend hours in it but then why bother coming to Nicosia if you're going to stay in your room?! (Honeymooners excepted of course).The bar is very nicely designed with comfortable lounge seating or tables/chairs if you wish to dine. The lighting is low and sometimes the TV is blaring out in Greek but just ask Costas (the bartender) to turn your lights up and the TV down - he's a fabulous guy who will go out of his way to accommodate your needs.The restaurant is cosy with the usual buffet breakfast n the mornings (nothing special but perfectly acceptable). I've never had lunch or dinner in the restaurant as there are so many great places to eat in Nicosia so can't comment on the food.The pool area is pleasant with a pool bar (staff are friendly as they are throughout the hotel) and at night the pool area is set up for romantic, candlelit dinners (again, I always go out and so can't comment on the food).There is a gym at the back of the hotel which I find excellent as Nicosia doesn't really lend itself to going out for long runs - the gym is a little hot but not enough to use as an excuse not to use!!Wifi is available at a charge in your bedroom but is a good speed - for cheapskates out there, you can borrow a cable and access free internet in the bar if you wish.The location of the hotel is just perfect for exploring Nicosia and eating out at night. Within a ten-minute walk you can either be in the heart of the old town, eating at the numerous tavernas, cafes and restaurants (or Wagamamas, McDonalds, TGIs etc for those less adventurous) or exploring modern shops .Please note that being in such a central location, this does mean that there is traffic noise at night if you wish to leave your balcony door open. However, when closed, the sound -proofing is excellent.Although a short drive in a taxi, I strongly recommend the Aegean restaurant - situated at the back of a bookshop in an older part of the city, the food and ambiance are both first class (book ahead and get an upstairs, balcony table). The restaurant is in an open courtyard so you can watch the stars as you eat some of the best Cypriot food in Nicosia. A little more pricey than most restaurants but well worth a visit.All-in-all this is a lovely, friendly, cosy, clean and modern hotel in the heart of Nicosia - well worth considering if you're visiting the capital.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 211 Similarity,0.455104099,Review 26 Similarity,0.277136998

30,"We have stayed at Cleopatra several times during the past few years. The service and the rooms have been improving. The reception is very welcoming and helpful. The gentleman in charge of the bar is very nice and attentive and the cleaning staff are professionals too.Things to improve:Breakfast: the table sets are rarely cleaned. On the first day, I had to ask one of the restaurant staff to remove the brown table sets (which were full of bread and stains) and also remove and change the white table cloth which was also full of stains. He was pretty rude and changed the table set with a smirk.On the second day, it was the same. This time we informed the restaurant manager and only after he told the staff, they really started cleaning the tables!As for breakfast itself, this time it was not like before. It seems that for example they don’t wash the cheese plates from one day to the other. You see finger prints all over the dishes.Swimming pool:The pool opens at 10 and exactly at the same time, the hotel staff starts reorganizing all the tables and chairs ... tons of clashes between chairs and tables every single day. On one occasion one more senior staff started shouting at a junior one! These tasks can perhaps be done the night before or earlier in the morning.Also the pool seems to be open to public. There is no shower, so people just walk in and enter the pool. It seems to be a popular place for children and their parties, but there is absolutely no code of conduct. Children are left to their own devices while their parents fill the pool area with smoke - literally. There is no such thing as conversation. To communicate with their children, parents shout from one side of the pool to the other.So if you expect some relaxing time or a proper swim, you will be disappointed. It will be noise and smoke and noise and smoke!Despite this, we hope to return to Cleopatra to have an improved experience.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 33 Similarity,0.460368442,Review 23 Similarity,0.264575131

On my last day I left my cardi in the restaurant and the host came to find me to give it back to me.I only went in the bar twice, but it’s a lovely area and was served by a very friendly barman who brought my drink outside to me as I was waiting for friends.I also visited friends in some of the older rooms, and these too were fine, perhaps not as attractive as the newly refurbished rooms, but still not disappointing.I didnt use the pool myself, but was told it was lovely.I am baffled that so many reviews have been less than complimentary.

The breakfast is very average and the breakfast room is like something from a youth hostel. Staff are completely disinterested and make zero effort.

10,"I've been in Nicosia for business purposes, and stayed in hotel for three weeks. Main impression - staff is very unprofessional, never would rate them as a 4* hotel. TWICE my personal belongings were TAKEN OFF BY HOTELL STAFF (minorly valued, but still that shouldn't happen in any hotel)! After both time I threat that I will call the police they returned them, otherwise I doubt that they would do so !!!When I approached the guy at the reception with my complains on this - he laughed in my face ?! ?! ?! On the top of the above - my company paid to the hotel more than 5500€ for their ""services"", so I can only imagine how they treat the customers that pay less ! Very very UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE which I wouldn't recommend to anyone.Beside these things with plunder of my personal belongings, there are other ""minor"" things I didn't like in this hotel:1. Half of the hotel is NOT REFURBISHED, so usual case is that you initially always get the room in the non refurbished part, so if you don't complain you'll be stuck in THE ROOM FROM MIDDLE '70s (again, we are speaking here about 4* hotel)2. BREAKFAST is every day the same, so after two weeks I stopped go there. Best thing they offer for the breakfast are the watermelons, but as nothing in this hotel is as it should be, they peal one water melon, and when it is eaten they don't refill the plate, so you have to go very early in the breakfast if you want to catch the full meal. This is the case with almost everything offered for breakfast (at least for decent stuff).3. STAFF that works in the dining room is mostly consisted of young men's (I'd rather say kids 15-20 years old ?!), who don't know how the service in a 4* hotel should look like, so when you ask them to bring you something (i.e. coffee, tea, etc.) they first turn around their eyes making ""a face"" and then go to do what you asked for. After I saw this is the usual case I stopped asking anything from them in order to avoid spit in my coffee or something4. BEDS ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE! Generally there are no twin beds but rather two single beds placed next to each other acting as a twin bed. When you sleep they know to spread apart and you can find yourself on the floor. Beside this they are very uncomfortable, so many mornings I woke up with the pain in my neck, my back and in my shoulders.Bottom line is that I will certainly avoid this hotel in the future, which I recommend to the other as well, because for the price which is equivalent to the prices of 4* hotels in London for instance, this level of ""quality"" and ""service"" is at least 20 levels below!Finaly, after my initial comment on TripAdvisor website I was threaten by the hotel owner that they will press charges on me for my negative rate and my comment ?

I understand that there are some facilities available to justify the 4-star, but overall I would say that this is at best an average 3-star Hotel.In particular, some positive comments are:1) cleanliness: As far as I remember, the room was cleaned every day,2) location: It is situated near the old town of Nicosia and other than that in a very central and convenient location.Some negative points are:1) The most important was the quality of breakfast, which was mediocre at best. There are indeed some choices to select from, but they are not of top quality. For example, the Hotel offers the typical small packed marmalades. Instead they could have offered home made (or similar) marmalades in jars. The same is true for the butter, honey, etc. They offer the same eggs and roasted bacon every day (the same bad quality of bacon every day). They could offer some fresh products or typical of Cyprus, like pies, to transform their breakfast in a traditional flavour experience. This breakfast is just the typical breakfast offered in the Hotels throughout Europe twenty years ago, and fortunately is not served anymore. The only positive thing was the fresh fruits.2) There were tea and coffee facilities in the room, but the tea-bags were not replaced every day.3) The rooms are not soundproof, and if your room is situated from the side of the road, you may encounter great problems with the noise.4) The Hotel gives an overall impression that it needs renovation.5) I have also a personal complaint. I did encounter a problem with the payment via my credit cards and it did seem that I had paid twice my bill (which was indeed true). I did ask for assistant from the Hotel reception. Although they did offer the assistance required after all, I had to send some mail reminders and to wait three or four days until they did send me the specific info I needed. I believe that this kind of service is unacceptable for a 4-star Hotel, especially when considering such a small, but important matter.Overall, I would say that for the rate of this Hotel (approximately 100 euros per night), you do not get what you pay for. Personally, I wouldn't revisit.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 36 Similarity,0.332376302,Review 110 Similarity,0.072074997

40,"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel in April 2017. I was on a business trip and it was the hotel my office recommended. Its rates were somewhat more economical than many hotels in the area and breakfast -- a very lovely buffet breakfast that included eggs, meats, cheeses, fruits, cereals, fresh bread, coffee, tea, juice -- is included in the price. The hotel is in a nice neighborhood with restaurants, banks and shops nearby. Old town Nicosia is a 15 minute walk away. Right now there is a construction site adjacent to the hotel and noise from that, which seems to start in-between 7-8am -- can be difficult for a good night's sleep. Hotel decor is dated (closet doors and carpets are slightly worn) but the room was clean and spacious enough by European standards. There are stairs leading up to the main entrance that would be difficult for a disabled person to climb (I was traveling with a colleague on crutches, and had to help her up the stairs). The lobby and restaurant have old world charm. The rooms include a mini-bar fridge with enough space to store a few of your own things (I am vegan and being able to store my own food is important to me). The room included a blow dryer and someone told me the hotel has guest laundry rooms available for use (I wish I would've known that earlier on in my stay, I would've used it). Sometimes, on the way up the stairs, I could smell smoke in the hallways. I think smokers use the stairwells -- which separate from the main hallways where the rooms are located by double glass doors -- creating the odor. There is an elevator that could help guests avoid the unpleasant smell but I know some people are bothered by cigarette smoke. My room had a small balcony with plastic lawn chairs and I'm certain, when the weather is warmer, it would be nice to sit outside. Outside the front of the hotel there is a wicker sofa and chairs off to the side, and it was a pleasant place to sit while I waited for taxis to arrive. The hotel has air conditioning. WiFi was okay (and free) but in the evenings the signal could be a bit spotty. Overall I had a good stay and I tend, on my own dime, to prefer hotels like this with ""character"" vice luxury hotels which cost an arm and a leg. I would stay here again, most definitely.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 70 Similarity,0.460131359,Review 24 Similarity,0.068720813
30,"The Cleopatra provided an ample room w/ twin beds for two people. The bathroom was large and had a roomy tub/shower combination. Amenities were available: extra blankets, hair dryer, safe, refrigerator. We especially enjoyed the lovely complimentary breakfast in a bright dining room with many windows. There were breakfast selections for every palate, including bacon and typical Mediterranean fare, cereals and breads, yogurt and plenty of fresh fruit and beverages. The pool was closed when we were there. It is only open in the warmer months. There is an exercise room which we never managed to use. The hotel was an easy six or eight minute walk to town, but we came home exhausted from traipsing around inside the Venetian walled city and never managed to have the energy to locate the exercise room. Staff helped us reserve a taxi to get to the Turkish airport in the northern third of the island.

The next day I received a renovated room looking decent. Breakfast was invariable every single day of the 3 weeks spent in the hotel. Large assortment of unhealthy food (fried eggs sausages, fried bacon, salami, croissants), 2 kinds of tasteless cheese (ricotta and yellow cheese), jam, butter, yogurt, compote, cereals and milk, bread.

50,"I enjoyed a very pleasant two-night stay here, on a recent visit to Nicosia. I had booked an executive room, and was upgraded to a suite (Room 118) on arrival.The suite was extremely spacious, and extremely comfortable. The main sitting room was comfortable, with sofa, chairs, and large television screen. It was stylish and contemporary, with very effective air conditioning. Adjoining this room was a small outside balcony. The separate bedroom was also very spacious, with comfortable king bed, decent pillows, desk, and a small table and chairs. A separate and effective air conditioning unit here ensured agreeable temperatures in the city’s high summers. The bathroom was also of a decent size, with large soft towels, and good toiletry products. Overall, it was a lovely room. The suite had a security safe, and a minibar (at additional cost, naturally). The maintenance on the room was good; it was generally devoid of marks and scratches, though the bedhead had some signs of wear. I was really pleased with the overall appearance and serviceability of the room. The wireless connection and strength were good. The room did not contain a full length mirror, nor an iron and a board, though ironing facilities were available in an ironing room on the third floor (but keep in mind it’s only available until 18:00 or 19:00).My only comment about the overall standard of the hotel’s appearance is that the public hallways to the bedrooms really need a refresh, to reflect the standard within the room. They were tired and dated, and could do with a repaint, new carpet, and some contemporary artwork on the walls.A decent buffet breakfast is included in the room rate. There’s a good selection of fresh fruits, cereals, pastries, breads, cheeses and cold meats, as well as hot breakfast items (fried eggs, bacon, sausage etc). On the first morning there was a presentable selection of traditional Cypriot breakfast items; I enjoyed sampling these more so than the standard hot breakfast selection. The coffee, however, was fairly ordinary- just a jug of brewed coffee rather than a barista style offering. There’s a couple of good coffee shops across the road if you are hankering for a double espresso. However, you won’t starve at the hotel and should leave well-fed!The hotel is not located within the old town area of Nicosia (that is, within the Venetian walls). However, it’s an easy (and directionally uncomplicated) walk of no more than ten minutes to the start of Ledra Street within the walled old town.Reservation was easy via the hotel’s website, and the first night’s charge for my stay was taken at point of reservation. The hotel represents very good value; my room rate per night was €xxxx. Coming from London in the UK, where hotel rooms are extortionate, this was much to my liking.The hotel has a pool, but I did not use that.The hotel staff were helpful and efficient, polite and professional.I could not have asked for a better stay.

10,"I've stayed at this hotel a few times over the last 8 years. The last time I visited was in 2010 and I felt then that the hotel needed significant upgrading. My latest visit was in October 2014 and I was surprised that nothing has been done to update the facilities. The hotel advertises a number of lovely modern rooms on its website. Sadly it only has a small number of these and the reality for most is a 1980's style bedroom. I had 2 rooms on this visit due to a broken door. The first had a modern bathroom but the 2nd had an old fashioned affair with a cracked toilet and a shower that had to be hand held to have any chance of the water hitting my head. The air conditioning unit left much to be desired - roaring and banging through the night. Like many Cypriot hotels this one has an ironing room. Sadly it is closed between 7pm and 7am - which is of little use to a hard working business traveller. I had to fight for it to be open after 7pm on my 2nd night after being reduced to nothing but my pyjamas as everything was too creased to wear. They did finally open it but there was no iron in the room and no-one knew where it was. Almost an hour later I managed to iron my clothes. My door broke on this visit - yet more evidence of a need to refurbish. Initially I was simply asked to use the chain - but as a female traveller I insisted that I had no desire to deal with a lack of security or a need to sit in my room all night guarding my things. They finally changed my room but there was no apology for the inconvenience and no offer of help to move a considerable amount of luggage between rooms and floors. I have a bad back so I didn't appreciate this. All in all this was a disappointing experience and I will be taking my custom elsewhere in future.

20,"This hotel advertises itself as a four star hotel; I couldn't disagree more. My overall impression was that guests' needs come after the needs of the hotel staff. I will give some examples:1. I asked for an iron to be delivered to my room on a Sunday evening at 6 PM. The front desk told me that the part of the hotel that could deliver an is closed and I will have to wait till 7 AM the next day to get an iron. This is an iron-not a masseuse, not a neurosurgeon to treat my migraine- an iron!!2. The hotel has a lovely outdoor pool. Unfortunately, the pool is only open from 10 AM till 6 PM. In addition, In order to get to the pool, you have to walk through many different corridors of the hotel-there is no lift to the pool. When you exit the pool you cannot go back into the hotel. You must instead go on the street, walk a bit, and then enter back to the hotel's main entrance. You better have a towel to dry off because otherwise you're walking in your bathing suit on the streets of Nicosia.3. The Cleopatra Hotel has a very nice gym. They apparently offer gym memberships for residents of Nicosia. As a hotel guest, you're permitted to use the gym. The hours of the gym on the weekends end at 6 PM. They advertise themselves as a four star hotel, but I don't believe closing the gym at 6 PM on the weekend is really four star treatment.4. Almost every hotel that I've ever stayed and has a nicely bound guestbook which explains all of the policies of the hotel. There is no guestbook at the Cleopatra Hotel. Instead they have several xerox copies of the various policies that they have in place at the hotel. This seems rather unprofessional.5. Referring back to #4, the list of rules for the pool alone, for example, is 30 items long. The warning prohibiting topless sunbathing is mentioned twice-I guess they had a problem with this. My favorite rule,however, is # 11- ""spitting or throwing garbage inside and outside the pool is prohibited""6. The Internet sign in & password were not offered on arrival. Having to call the front desk after realizing the password was not supplied was less than 4 star customer service.To prove that I am not a totally negative reviewer, I must mention that the breakfast is quite good with lots of variety. The Internet is fairly fast. The pool is excellent as long as you arrive between 10 and 6 PM. Ditto on the gym. The location of the hotel is quite good and I am told that each room has its own balcony.In conclusion, this hotel really needs to step up its game and train its staff on customer service.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 167 Similarity,0.39277666,Review 57 Similarity,0.03827795

There are a couple of choices for eating - the bar and the outdoor poolside restaurant - both served excellent, reasonably priced fayre. There is a good breakfast spread.

20,The rooms really let this hotel down. It has a gorgeous pool and the breakfast was lovely. An entire floor of the hotel smelt like sewage. It was totally unbearable. I asked to move and we were placed on another floor that smelt of smoke. I paid for an executive room which was very disappointing.

The bed was of poor quality and blanket had a stain. The bath tab was damaged and the room door so thin that you could hear everything happening outside.

Usually you will find a cab standing right outside the main entrance.Rooms could use a renovation, there is a functioning air-conditioning, but ventilation seems to be poor so there is a strong smell of old moisture. Bathroom in my room was very compact and, in some places, critically small. The breakfast selection was very tasty, at least according to my ""egg&beacon"" preferences. In general, the personnel were very helpful and polite. I saw information in the reception that the hotel offers a lot of things, including kick-boxing classes :) but due to lack of time, I have not tried those.

Still, it would also be convenient for anyone wishing to explore the old parts of Nicosia. Here you stay in a clean and good hotel in quiet surroundings compared to the noise you may experience in the old parts of the city. I was there off-season and never saw that many people in the breakfast room and hardly heard any neighbours. The room was recently refurbished, it was large and had a balcony. The buffet breakfast was good by south European/Mediterranean standards and had everything I needed for a good start of the day.
