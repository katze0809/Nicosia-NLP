Now it host cultural centre with shows and performances, especially dancing dervishes.Architecturally, it is a stunning building too.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
50,"The building is not that special, though rich in religious history. Currently under renovation which is pleasing. We went to experience a short demonstration of whirling dervishes who spun round wuite fast whilst praying. Quite a spectacle if you can see them. Lasts about 10 minutes. We were on a guided tour so not sure if you would have to pay.",Bedestan Church and Mosque

30,"It's a nice place to visit and a must see if you're in Nicosia, sadly this was a former church which has been converted into a mosque, so the interior is not worth seeing but from the outside it looks beautiful.",Bedestan Church and Mosque

40,"Another Christian -> Muslim conversion. Personally love the architectural changes. A pleasant, calm space.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,Church to Mosque conversion. Worth seeing what is retained as having value from one group to another. Worth checking out the craftsmanship of the stone masons and how the external form remains pretty much intact. Very relaxed and quiet inside and a place you can catch your breath from the huge amount of tourists in the area.,Bedestan Church and Mosque
30,"Formerly St Nicholas church. Fine decorative elements around the doors, etc. To be admired even if you don't attend the whirling dervishes performance.",Bedestan Church and Mosque

40,This was an interesting experience. Meditative music and spinning young men performing this ritual dance.Forth of seeing.,Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,This attraction is now out of date on TripAdvisor as it is now only a church and hasn't been a mosque for some time. The mosque is next door and is called Selimiye. Once again the materials used in building this church were sandstone and photos from the outside are difficult as it's in a built up area so you're right on top of it. Venture around the rear of the building too as it has some nice architecture and arches but inside it is very plain.,Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,"Managed to get out timings right this time and managed to see the Whirling Dervishes. 2 male dancers performing their ritual meditation program. They observe the rituals first by saluting the red fur post representing their founder Hz Mevlana Caladeein Rumi Bn 1207. This is then followed by a brief meditation before the dancers start spinning around and around and around. How they do not fall over I don't know, I was dizzy watching them.Thoroughly recommend you visit and learn the history.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
50,"The architecture and details on the walls by the main entrance reminded me of Kolner Dom. Quite a piece of art. Feels strange to see it near a mosque, but well... history happens.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
30,"Bedesten, just a shell (although an impressive one) of a building now that was originally built as a Byzantine church and has also served as a Catholic Church and a market.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,"Along with so much of Nicosia, the splendour of the religious buildings is the architecture. The interior is also worth the effort of seeing.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,The portal is beautiful. It is a very old architecture well maintained. Interior I don't think very interesting with an entrance ticket. There are a lot of small stone statues in the church.,Bedestan Church and Mosque
30,The review of the site in the Planet made it sound like a must see. The EU spent 2M Euro in restoring it. The history and complexity of the different ages and styles in the building is considerable. The impact of a visit was underwhelming. As it is next door to the Mosque it is still worth a look.,Bedestan Church and Mosque
50,It was built as a church during the Byzantine period. later on used as a Bedestan by Ottomans. Now there is a whirling dervish show on certain times of the day and also the place is used for exhebitions. Give a try...,Bedestan Church and Mosque
50,"The building is interesting in its own right and contains a range of ceramic figures and heads from the different phases of Cypriot history. In addition 4 times a day (1200, 1400, 1500 and 1700) there is a demonstration by members of the Dervish culture. It costs €7 but was well worth it. There is a pamphlet available when you pay that has information about the sect.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
50,"There is an entrance fee to this place and is located across from the suleymani mosque. There are many pre-christian idols in exhibits in the main floor of the museum. The Whirling Dervish show was a one man presentation. A short introduction to Dervish is given by the dancer. During the show, the dancer appears to go into a trance and it could be a pretty spiritual experience. Was surprised to learn that Whirling Dervishes were founded by an Afghani person called Rumi.",Bedestan Church and Mosque

40,"We always make a point of visiting the Mosque when we come to Lefkosa, and this year saw the Whirling Dervishes at the Bedestan",Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,"So if you review this just for the buidling then nothing remarkable and not worth paying €1 to go inside. No idea why the European Union would have committed huge funding for this renovation?But the must see in my opinion is the Whirling Dirvishes ceremony for €7.They carry out the ceremony four times a day.One of the most incredible things I've seen in a long time, if you have a faith, please take time to see this.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,A very charming old city center. The church was a spectacular gem.All tourist are ask to take off shoes and women are to wear a head covering. Pictures are permitted. The architecture is spectacular!,Bedestan Church and Mosque
20,"There wasn't a lot to see or to do. I had to pay €1 to get in, but I better could have skipped the place.",Bedestan Church and Mosque

40,"Close to the Selimiye Mosque the Bedestan was originally a 12th century Byzantine church it was enlarged by the Lusignans, then the Venetians and then became a Greek Orthodox Cathedral. Under the Ottamans it became a grain store and a cloth market and fell into disrepair .It was once the busiest and most important market place in Nicosia.Looking at the front of the north entrance you will see that it is very similar to that of the Selimiye Mosque so I wonder why two churches were built so close together.The restoration started in 2004 and five years later the Bedestan was reopened and is now a cultural venue.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
40,"The Bedestan is located next to the Selimiye Mosque and is famous for its Dervish Show (more details at the entrance), but also can be visited without seeing the show for a small mfee of 1 EUR.

40,"We discovered a beautiful clay exhibition here, people doing various clay objects and overall a tranquil atmosphere.A nice place to visit if you are in the area one afternoon.",Bedestan Church and Mosque

40,"Stumbled across this building that use to be St. Nicholas Church. It is currently used as a venue for concerts, dance shows etc. There was a fee of a couple of euros to go in, but we just stuck our heads in.The Bedesten is a 14th century gothic styled building built of ashlar stone blocks upon the ruins of a Byzantine building. It was used as a church in the Lusigan period, as a Metropolitan building under the name of St. Nicholas Church by the Orthodox community in the Venetian period. Following the Ottoman conquest, it's name changed to the Bedesten, after which it was used as a textile Market, a food Market, a flour Market, and a wheat store before falling into disuse.",Bedestan Church and Mosque
