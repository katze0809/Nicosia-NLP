50,"Beautiful little boutique place in the backstreets of North Nicosia. Selay is a wonderful host and would do anything to make you feel welcome. Parking space outside the Guesthouse, flexible check in / check out hours and 10 mins walk to the Ledra crossing. Great communication pre-arrival. Highly recommending!",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"I wasn’t going to review as I only give five or the one but I think this place is worthy of the five. Only two issues which I believe see will try ti fix. The main one is wifi only work part time in the yellow rose room. Not sure why it works when she was there. But the court yard and kitchen served my needs! The other is the bathroom is small in this room. I am 110kg at 69cm and it was difficult getting into the shower. If your small this probably would be ok. I would recommend the white rose bathroom as it is bigger and she already fixed that wifi besides that there about the same. Her staff doesn’t speak english but I did not have any issue communicating with them by sign language and the occasional google translator! Even helped fix the gas issue on the stove. If you cannot find thing to do in the north she will help you with your plans. If I come back I think a week would have been needed. Coming though the boarder from the south is easy and its only a ten min walk to her place, about half that time if you need a taxi. They do speak english here but it is not common. I liked the north better I find them a lot more friendly and its not as touristy and the best part its cheaper.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights, the guest house is a quiet haven shut away from the hustle and bustle of the city, an easy 10 minute walk from either of the border crossings and all the major sites in the city. The owner, Selay, is a delightful lady and advised that Gul Hanim is her grandmother’s old home. Rooms have been renovated in traditional style and breakfast is served in the little courtyard. Superb fresh orange juice and a host of other products, much of which is home made. Highly recommend a stay here.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"this house its just amazing,in the heart of old town, near to most touristic places like Kyrenia Gate,just on the corner,very good restaurant just in the corner,very clean place, exchange store, everything very close.Breakfast fresh and delicious,the room smell so good.the owner,its something else, she help me with my visit plan, told me about places i have no ideia, and was wonderfull to visit all them.the staff was amazing,always with big smiling in there face, thx for everything you did for me.....high recommended",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"I have travelled to many different places in the world, however I don't think any of them compare to Gul Hanim House. This was by far one of the best places to stay in Lefkosa, it is infused with tradition and culture and hosted by the most knowledge and friendly host (Selay). The rooms in the guesthouse were spacious and clean and had everything we needed, the garden and surroundings were lovely - as you enter the guesthouse you're greeted with the musk of a citrus tree which is phenomenal. The kitchen was open for use 24/7, this really helped it to feel like home! I would thoroughly recommend this guesthouse.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"We were a party of four women, this little place was perfect for our stay. We felt completely at home, it is a beautifully preserved traditional home and has been lovingly renovated to its former glory. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms are lovely too, it has all the necessary mod cons without compromising on tradition. The place is spotlessly clean, breakfast was lovely and the kitchen was available to use all day. We felt completely safe and comfortable during our stay. Selay (the owner) was extremely knowledgable on the local history and geography and she was able to help us plan our trip across northern Cyprus. We will definitely be visiting again",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Gul Hanim House only has 3 small rooms. All, however are nicely renovated and spotlessly clean. As mentioned in other reviews, the owner, Selay is staggeringly helpful and an absolute wealth of information about sights and restaurants all over Northern Cyprus. When she is not around the house is managed by a friendly Turkish mother and her children. The location can be difficult to find the first time, as the neighborhood is in the process of being demolished, renovated or neglected, but downloading an offline map app such as maps.me has the address marked perfectly. Numerous restaurants in the area, many cater towards foreign students studying in Nicosia's universities, so no problem with the language. Most of the city's sights are within a 15 minute walk, as is the Ledra Street crossing which, for most of us is possible to go over to the Southern side and return. Most of the breakfasts (jams, bread etc) are home made and of very high quality. Very quiet, you may even have the whole house to yourself some nights. Overall a great few day's stay in a culturally and politically interesting part of the world. Would happily stay here again.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Located in one of the narrow but very safe streets in north Nicosia, about 10mn walk from the Ledra street crossing; the GHH is a comfortable, welcoming, full of character small guest house The owner / manager, Ms Selay, is a very warm and helpful person.... the only draw-back, one needs a GPS to find the place! That and some very noisy cats - but that's true for the whole of Cyprus... Highly recommended.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"The shabby street on the approach to Gul Hanim might be enough to put some people off, but they would be making a huge mistake. Once through the gate into the delightful courtyard it is immediately obvious that this is a lovingly preserved property. Selay, the lively hostess, provided a street map and pointed out all the best places to visit and eat (Sabor restaurant is excellent). As with the house, with its beautiful antique furniture, we loved the character of the north side of Nicosia, but were less enamoured of the KFCs and Burger Kings in the shopping mall over the border. The city is well worth the visit just to experience the contrast.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,It was a perfect place to stay. The owner was very nice helpful and positive. The place was authentic and very clean. Everything in detail was original. I can't find words for it. For sure we come again.,Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Conveniently located steps away from the Kyrenia gate which is walking distance to the main attractions both in Greek and Turkish sides. It is also very close to the bus services if you are looking to have day trips to Kyrenia or Famagusta. The place is located in the historic quarter, you are surrounded with old Turkish, Greek and Ottoman houses and a community that lives in them. Selay has given us excellent recommendations for places to eat, shop and see. We really felt we were at home throughout our stay. Every morning we enjoyed a lovely breakfast in the courtyard. It is a little oasis of calm and beauty away from the bustle of the city but so close as well. If you are looking for a unique place to stay with a lovely host, Gul Hanim's House is your best bet. Enjoy Cyprus!",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
40,This place is very clean and super characterful. The hostess was very helpful in helping us find a restaurant and how to get to the Ledra St crossing. That's an experience well worth taking.The guest house is in a very run-down part of Northern Nicosia and difficult to find. But the area seems very safe.Great breakfast of local produce.,Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Anyone reading through the previous reviews for Gul Hanim will be in no doubt that this is a very desirable place at which to stay. I can only endorse those sentiments: it's wonderful. But first you have to find it. My advice is to make for Kyrenia Gate, which is a key entrance point into the old part of town. From there, simply ask for the street name: Celaliya Sokak, which is a minor street off the Square. If the locals in the Square don't know it, ask staff at one of the cafes or shops adjacent to the Square, or in the Information Centre, located in the Gate. They can supply you with a map, and Gul Hanim is marked on this; the guesthouse is a distance of about 150m from the Square.Selay is a wonderful host: vibrant, knowledgeable and ever obliging. After I arrived,she spent quite a while pointing out on a map possible places to eat, and suggesting places to visit. Subsequently, she was also extremely helpful in directing me to buses, and transport nodes.The room I occupied was very comfortable: lovely furnishings, good bed, an excellent bathroom, good lighting. The adjacent courtyard is filled with succulents, as well as a couple of fruit trees. It's a delight just to sit here, and relax. Breakfast is laid out in a nearby kitchen - itself a beautiful room - and offers a good range, including superb homemade jams. However, there are no cereals, which I would suggest should be added to the offerings. On the calm, sunny mornings I was here, you took your breakfast into the cowurtyard.What more to say?: only that I was very pleased to have selected Gul Hanim for my stay in this interesting city.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Gül Hanım house was a beautiful, tastefully restored family home run by extremely hospitable hosts. Our stay was quiet and peaceful, and we loved walking around the unspoiled old city of northern Nicosia from there. Bathroom was very nice, loved the tiles!Breakfast was also excellent, including cheese pastries, many homemade jams and honey, and olives. The coffee was so delicious, I made our host show us the brand and type.The only warning I would give potential guests is book early -- they only have a few rooms so they are liable to be full!",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"I can only agree with the 93% of other reviewers, Gul Hanim House is an excellent place to stay when visiting Lefkosa.A single story house, fully renovated, bedrooms centered around a family courtyard. In Summer the courtyard becomes dining room, lounge, playground.The bedrooms are immaculate, clean and comfortable.All the historical areas are within a short walking distance, Impossible to get lost.Nicosia is a great place to visit. People are lovely, friendly, helpful.Stop off at the BIG HALL for coffee, tea, snack or pastry. Enjoy the craft centers, the museums or just enjoy the streets.Do not let the ""run down"" areas put you off, that is Nicosia!",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Authentic old house in the centre of the walled city. Only 10 minutes walk from the Ledra Street crossing. The house belonged to the owner's grandmother, and they have meticulously restored it and converted it to a three bedroom guesthouse with a breakfast room. The immediate area is a bit run down, but walking into the city we always felt safe both during the day and at night. Salay was extremely helpful, advising on where to visit and where to eat. The rooms have heating and separate air conditioning. The whole place was spotless. Breakfast was adequate with eggs, cheeses and olives, pastries, bread for toast, home made jams and unlimited tea and coffee. Tea and coffee were also available free of charge all day. Wifi is free, but we found it iffy and we had a whole day when we could not connect. Salay, the owner, lives in Kyrenia (Girne), and there were long periods when no one was on site.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"This is a beautifully restored house in North Nicosia, in quiet street, a short walk from Famagusta Gate, with a welcoming courtyard surrounded by a few rooms. The rooms are cosy and comfortable, tastefully decorated with what seems to be the original house furniture complemented with a few additions that maintain the style of a comfortable, neat and traditional family house.The owner, Selay, was very helpful and with her suggestions and ideas quickly improved our holiday plan for our stay in Nicosia. Instead of a few quite walks around the city and perhaps a trip to Salamis, with Selay's help, we quickly organised trips to Girne, Famagusta and the Karpaz peninsula, as well as the best places to eat and have a coffee in North Nicosia.The evenings were quiet and restful, and the breakfast in the morning was delicious, with tasty bread, great fruit preserves, both sweet and full of fruit flavor and strong coffee.We highly recommend this place as it was key to a fantastic three days in Nicosia.Nuno.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Gul Hanim house has a perfect location, within reach of all the main sites and facilities in Nicosia/Lefkhosa. It is a small boutique establishment, with immense character and charm. It carries with it a story of human togetherness and love, coming from the memories of the grandmother after whom the house is named. The lady who runs the house (granddaughter of Gul Hanim) is remarkably friendly and always helpful, and the service staff reflect the same wonderful quality. The rooms are arranged around a courtyard with an orange tree, for sofas on which guests can relax. There is a well-supplied kitchen, with comfortable seating and a welcoming home-feeling, which is available for use by guests at any time. There is a feeling of peace and tranquillity not only in the house but in the neighbourhood generally. I can not think of anywhere where one could have a more relaxing and refreshing holiday.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,This guesthouse belonged to Selaye's grandmother and she has spent 5 years restoring it. We loved the attention to detail and could not fault the place .There are 3 comfortable and clean rooms round a small attractive courtyard where you can have breakfast or just while away some time We were greeted by Selaye the owner with tea and local cake . She supplied lots of information about the town but also recommended places to eat and those we tried were good. Breakfast is self service from the kitchen and was a great array of different things from muesli to tradional borek and olives . Plenty of variety to suit all tastes. Hot drinks were available at all times.Guests can use the fridge in the kitchen.The location is good in the old town near the Girne gate and hence minibuses for moving on. We walked evrywhere and nowhere in the old town is more than 10 mins from Gul Hanum. It is also perfectly safe to walk around at night although there are not many people around just little oases of noise and light from a few cafes.Selaye was a lovely host and has excellent English . We loved this place .,Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"It was a stressfull morning when we lost our flight and we had to find accomodation in Lefkosa. We ended up after walking around with heavy baggage at Gul Hanim House where we were greated at the door by a perfect english speaking woman who owned the place. Her name was Selay and was a former english teacher. Gul Hanim House only have 3 rooms for rent, and the rooms are located inside a beautiful sheltered house with a great garden in the middle of the complex. Here we we could make coffie and tea from very nice kitchen and get our strength back after a rather stressful morning. Breakfeast is also included.Selay was the perfect host and provided us with useul information both about the city's culture and history. If you want to explore the city of Lefkosa, or simply have a relaxing safe harbour Gul Hanim House comes highly reccomended.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"I found this place by mistake, it was such a pleasant surprise. I stayed in the Rose room, it had a queen size bed (US standard), and the room was gloriously authentic in its every detail. The power switches were from the early era or electricity, the door handles were from that era too, yet it all somehow managed to fulfill the creature comforts that I've become accustomed to.It had high ceilings, power outlets, a hair-dryer, shampoo, body wash, towels, AC, ceiling fan, window, high water pressure, etc.I am from the US and we have high expectations from hotels, and the Gul Hanim delivered above my expectations.The breakfast was homemade, and while the word ""homemade"" has been abused by many; here it means that the hotel owner/manager picked the fruit herself from her own garden and made the jam. She had all sorts including figs, carob, and strawberry. Think about that for a minute.I stayed in several hotels in south Nicosia, including the Cleopatra, and was very disappointed. Other 5 star hotels were just too expensive. The Gul Hanim was a few short minutes walk to the border. You'll pass some very traditional neighborhoods, it's truly mesmerizing.Trip to the airport was painless, it took no more than 30 min.There were some areas that could use some improvements. The door had a little opening at the bottom, I used one of the hand towels to block it. The doors are also thin and there is a gathering area right outside it, so you can clearly hear a conversation of whoever is there. The WiFi is intermittent and sometimes slow. Also, if you don't speak Turkish there'll be nothing for you on TV.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"I had the pleasure of staying at Selay,s beautiful guest house for two nights. The accommodation was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The enchanting little courtyard is peaceful and relaxing. Guests have use of a fridge in the kitchen and tea and coffee is complimentry - just help yourself. The guesthouse is located on the northern fringe of the old town of Nicosia, near Kyrenia (Girne) Gate, an easy 15 stroll from the Ledra Street border crossing. From Kyrenia Gate you can get taxi/minibuses to Kyrenia and Famagusta.The area had the feel of being safe, day and night. It is not an affluent neighbourhood but it is a hive of activity and seemed quite friendly.Selay was very helpful with her advice on what to do and see during my short stay. Her recommendation and description of the Buyuk Hamam was spot on. A fantastic experience!I admire what Selay has achieved and will promote her business with work colleagues as I want to see her succeed. I expect that the future will see further regeneration in the old town and it's environs. The Gul Hanim Guesthouse is an example of how this is starting to happen. It is a true home from home. Highly recommended.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"We stayed one more extra night since we really loved this house. It's visible how much effort was given to design this guest house complex. The furniture is pretty much in old (British) style. There is a (shared) kitchen that has a warm atmosphere. The location of Gül Hanım House is in the Old town. We had a long travel behind with long delays. A warm welcome from the grand child of Gül Hanım removed our tiredness and the complex provided a magnificent energy. Definitely worth to stay if you want to be in the historical old town, close to the Greek side and if you want to stay where you could relax.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
30,I have been impressed by the friendly manner of Selay who is always ready to help you.This house is located in an old area of Lefkosa and near the center of that city.Clean rooms and great breakfast you can find there.I went there from Iran,Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,We enjoyed a perfect short stay in this fabulously restored Cypriot home in the heart of Lefkosa. A short walking distance from all of the historic sites down with plenty of cafes and restaurants to stop at along the way.We can not speak highly enough of the house and hosts and would recommend them to all.,Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Wonderful place to stay! Clean, beautiful and charming. It's worthwhile. I absolutely recommend it!Posto magnifico e affascinante. Cura e amore si percepiscono. Ottima scelta per Nicosia Nord. Da provare.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
40,I have been very impressed by the friendly welcome of the owner and the very tasteful renovation of the rooms!there is a nice courtyard to sit outside and you can get drinks at any tim from the kitchennice place to ray when you want to discover Lefkosa / Nicosia on foot!,Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"İt is one of the best locations to stay in Cyprus. It is authentic and ordained with traditional decor of the best kind. The host is very wonderful and beautiful and kind. She is very helpful and hospitable. Furthermore, the service is wonderful such as the tea and the Turkish coffee.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,I highly recommend this beautiful house : well located (at the heart of the city) and with everything you need (incl. an excellent authentic breakfast). The host was very welcoming and helpful. Authentic Cyprus style with handmade decoration.Feel like home!,Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Lefkoşa, also thanks to helpful tips from the owner. The room was clean, and the much-needed A/C also worked perfectly. The breakfast was also perfect.The house itself is old, but very nicely preserved and with a great atmosphere. The location is also great, as most of the main sights are within walking distance.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"The house is very cute, location is great. Selay Hanım is very friendly and helpful. Room looks great, clean and well-kept. Breakfast is homemade and tasty. Definitely recommend it to anyone else looking to visit Lefkoşa.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Lovely boutique guesthouse, with plenty of charm and superb hostess and staff. The bed was comfortable and the room spotless. Breakfasts in the courtyard were my favourite part of the day, plentiful and varied. The free wifi works well, which made it a great place from which to work from. The house is only 2 minute walk from Girne Gate and 10 minute walk from the Ledra passage/checkpoint, making it a great base from which to explore the city.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
40,"Refurbished and restored in memory of the owner's' beloved grandmother - Mrs Rose. Three bedrooms. The red rose room - the nicest with a double bed for lovers! The white rose room and the yellow rose room with twin beds. Nice bathrooms with slippers, toiletries plus a hairdryer. Owner speaks excellent English. The complex is in a private courtyard with table and sofas outside. Free wifi throughout but in the red rose room you can't charge your phone. You have to use the open community kitchen. Large red fridge. Microwave but no cooking allowed. No one sleeping on the premises. The owner lives in Kyrenia but comes daily to check guests in. The housekeeper, who knows no English, lives close by and makes the self service small traditional breakfast. No European continental breakfast served. All local produce. Good selection of teas. I was still hungry afterwards! Not suitable for long stays. Comfy bed and beautiful decor and handmade furnishings. A torch can be provided as the narrow street is dark and ground uneven. This is a local working class district two minutes from Kyrenia gate where there is a good cheap local restaurant and English spoken. Not really suitable for solo women. Owner collected me from the border otherwise I would never have found the house alone. She also gave me a lift to Kyrenia where she lives. Perfect place to learn Turkish vocabulary. Overpriced at E60 and no winter rate or SOLE occupancy rate. I was there in the winter so you needed heating at night and early morning in the kitchen. Good for a local North Cyprus experience.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"Gol Hanim is a safe and comfort place to stay in old Nicosia. Although it is located in heart of old city, it is cozy, quiet and suitable for resting. Actually it is a traditional house which keeps its own old appearance in spite of changes that have been done in it for tourist users to feel comfort. All in all it is very nice and interesting place.Historical places of old Nicosia is just a few minutes walking far from Gul Hanim and you really don’t need taxi at all. I visited Buyuk hamam and Buyuk Khan and …. They were so interesting. Also I went to Girna that is just 20 minutes buy bus. You can visit its nice and spectacular harbor and a historical castle and its lighthouse and a new one lighthouse and many beautiful boats over there, or you can buy something from its modern shops.For those Iranians who have an appointment with US consulate in North Cyprus, I strongly recommend here because it is so close, just 10 minutes walking. Also for those of you who don’t have a credit card they will reserve for you by a phone call or E-mail.Its price 60-70 Eu per night seems rather expensive, but all in all prices are same in this district and you cannot find another cheaper one here.Selay is manager here and she speaks English very well. She is so kind and friendly and she does her best try for passengers to feel it is their own home. There are a large number of free maps and plans in her office and she makes marks on them and guides you how and where you can go for visiting historical and interesting places. She is very adaptable and you can call or E-Mail her for request for check in or check out for other hours.I stayed 4 days in Gul Hanim and had a great time, thus if I go to Nicosia again; I will reserve there.Thank you so much Selay.",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
50,"I stayed at Gül Hanim House for few days and was completely charmed by the house and its host, the lovely Selay. It is in the center of north Nicosia, about 5 minutes walk from the Ledra Street crossing point. The historical center of both south and north Nicosia is within walking distance and you will be able to explore all the major sites within few minutes walk.The house is just amazing - a paradise in the old town. As soon as you walk in you feel like at home in its pleasant quiet yard. The room was spacious, with high ceilings with exposed wooden beams, super clean and well equipped (TV, Wi-Fi, extra blankets, daily cleaning service etc). One of my favorites is the bathroom - chic, vintage Arabic tiles, brand new appliances but chosen with great taste. All the furniture is wooden, hand-made, respecting the original style of the house.Breakfast is served in a common kitchen (again, tastefully reconstructed and decorated) and can be taken at a table in the common yard.The host of the house, Selay, is half of the success of this amazing house. She is friendly, speaks excellent English and went out of her way to help me enjoy my stay, giving many helpful tips and materials (maps, guide books etc.) and even helped me to rent a car. She has a great love for her country and will do all she can to help you discover it.It is a great place from which you can set out to explore north Cyprus. You will be able to drive to the very north east (Dipkarpaz) in about 2,5 hours and to Girne in only about 30 minutes. North Cyprus, as oppose to the south, is much less touristy and has a lot to offer (great nature, very pleasant and helpful people, beautiful empty beaches, good food..).All in all, a place not to miss out if you travel to north Cyprus!",Gul Hanim House Boutique Hotel
