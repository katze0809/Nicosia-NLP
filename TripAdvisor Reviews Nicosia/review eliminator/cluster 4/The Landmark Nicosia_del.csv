50,"The hotel was just as expected. The bedroom was very comfortable. Yes - a little tired in places - but the service was 5 star. Had a problem with a slight leak in the bathroom, reported it to the wonderful George at reception. Had to move room and was compensated with a lovely suite. Could not have been more helpful. The main asset this hotel has are its staff. They are all polite and helpful. I asked for a mirror for the bedroom, (there is a large wall mirror and magnifying mirror in the bathroom but I prefer one in the bedroom area) Maria, the executive housekeeper was on to it straight away, a delightful lady. The dining room staff are attentive and quietly efficient. We stayed for 7nights, and loved it. The outdoor pool area was very inviting and a pleasant place to sit and relax. Would definitely return",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 29 Similarity,1,Review 1 Similarity,0.461690258

I don't mind paying good money for service, food and drinks, however this place charges top rates and offers the service of a 3 star hotel.Rooms are dated, something out of the 1970's, brown carpets, torn curtaind and old fashioned bathrooms.Don't stay here.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 296 Similarity,0.461690258,Review 108 Similarity,1
40,This hotel is a typical Hilton in many ways. The hotel is well built with good sized rooms and large reception areas with a coffee bar. There is a outside pool and an inside one as well as a car park albeit probably a little too small. The layout of the hotel is good with a variety of shops and the staff are extremely helpful both within the hotel and at reception.The downside is probably that there is only one restaurant which is primarily buffet but includes an al a carte option. The menu is very much a standard international menu and not particularly interesting. There is a bar which is segregated from the restaurant and the reception and includes tv screens covering sport but this is generally pretty empty.Generally a good hotel and a good choice when you are going to the business area of Nicosia.,The Landmark Nicosia,Review 432 Similarity,0.465130255,Review 102 Similarity,0.50902781

From reception to concierge with a special mention for breakfast and executive lounge staff, every member of staff was thoughtful and caring. They smiled and always did their very best to help.

40,"This was my first stay in a Hilton hotel and on the whole it lived up to all my expectations. The service was consistently excellent, from our arrival at 2.30am after a delayed flight and personal note from the manager checking we had arrived ok (in response to our email to Hilton informing them of our expected late arrival).I was staying at the Hilton for a conference at the University of Cyprus, and the proximity to the university could not have been better - a 5-10 minute walk. The distance to Nicosia however is a bit more - about a 30 minute walk. This is not a problem, as the hotel is located in a nice area, in the business district and the distance from the town means it is fairly quiet, with lots of space around the pool, and parking. It's an easy walk into town, but more than the advertised 15 minutes. There is no shortage of taxis in the town, and a taxi bell at the hotel, so it is easy and inexpensive to get to the centre.There is a good choice of restaraunts, a pool with loungers and towels, and the rooms are comfortable and clean. My only criticism would be the lack of free wifi, if not in the bedrooms then at least in the bar areas. For those of us who can't charge internet costs back to work, some free wifi access would have been appreciated!It's an ideal hotel for business, or for anyone attending the university and I'd happily stay again.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 981 Similarity,0.395628284,Review 279 Similarity,0.507382569
50,"I stayed for four nights at the Hilton Cyprus Hotel. It was a business trip. The hotel is really very good, with smart, fully equipped rooms, great indoor and outdoor pools, rich breakfast, excellent service and very friendly and available staff. A bank and various shops (including a sport shop, a hairdresser / barber shop, an utilities shop) could be found in its premises. They could be very useful and they are very discreet.The executive lounge, accessible if you are booked in an executive room, is very pleasant. Please however note that, while drinks (both cold and hot) are available throughout the opening times (07.00-23.00), food is only available for breakfast and some snacks and salads are available in the evenings (until 20.00). There is no fresh food served for lunch or in the afternoon (apart from some fruit), which is a pity.Additional services are, however, quite expensive. One hour use of wi-fi costs 6 euro and a 50 cl bottle of mineral water costs 6 euros too. Food in the resturant is excellent and the buffet is rich but prices are also towards the higher end.In any case, it is really an excellent hotel - highly recommended.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 994 Similarity,0.395628284,Review 280 Similarity,0.507382569
40,"It is situated very near the center of the capital, just 10 mins walking distance. Ideal for those who want to sight see around Nicosia and are not afraid to walk a bit. A hotel with lots of History behind which has always been the best Hotel of Nicosia. It is an old type Hilton, in a good sense. Traditional Hilton luxury (I have seen Hiltons who don't deserve to be having the name) kept and reserved over the decades even though ownership changed few years back.A big plus to this hotel is that many of the workers there are still Cypriots and their Hotel-pedia is far advanced form others. The touristic and hotel management schools of the island are of the best in Europe in my opinion and they do know better how to treat clients.The moment u get inside this hotel it makes you feel unique.

All the staff were friendly and went out of their way for us. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. The chef came around to the tables with fresh baked olive bread which was delicious. The executive lounge had cocktail hour from 5-7pm offering alcohol drinks, soft drinks, and light snacks. The only negative thing I can say about this hotel is that it's in serious need of an upgrade. The rooms look like they were designed in the 1970's. There are hardly any plugs in the rooms and no USB ports at all. The furniture and decor in the room as well as in the lounge and restaurant needs to be updated.

The decor throughout is out of date, but the hotel is very well maintained, and it doesn't show any major signs of wear and tear. I can't vouch for the location because I mostly worked or stayed at the hotel. However, it was a short cab ride to the area where the local banks have their head offices, and probably a 5 minute ride to the main restaurant area.

That said, there are not many quality hotels in the city center. But the hotel is nice: good rooms, swimming pool etc. The rooms are slightly tired but clean. The food in the restaurants is tasty but not the special quality you might expect in this level of hotel.

We made use of the restaurant both nights we were there which is generally out of character for us but i was so blown away by how friendly the team were we almost couldn't be bothered with the rest of the city - however we decided that maybe we should see at least some of Nicosia.We checked in a little early with no hesitation from the team, one of the rooms was ready so we ditched the bags and went out and gained the other room later - definitely worth the wait!! Some of the front desk team are learning their new roles and the manager clearly has an eye for talent as these were very amenable colleagues who are eager to learn and please. Not one negative here. Perfect.The executive lounge was a pleasant experience with snacks and drinks available at intervals through out the day. It's nice to feel a little special and the service it's self as well as the amenity delivered this.The restaurant service is second to none, we enjoyed an a la carte meal on the first night and a buffet delivered by friendly, attentive and not over bearing team. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Top marks once again.Breakfast was really impressive with chefs offering breads and pastries at the table, never seen this before and was very impressed with it! The housekeeping team asking if guests are happy about their rooms is a brilliant touch and once again, impressive!The spa is fantastic, sauna is powerful and jacuzzi is comfortable.

This is noisy all night long with the traffic (the windows of the rooms, which look thick enough, are obviously not well isolated/installed).Check-in and check-out went smoothly with a smiling staff. This first process already gave me a good opinion of the hotel.The room was nice, well equipped (even 1 electrical plug for non UK extensions/cables). The safe was large enough for a laptop but maybe installed too high in the cupboard (you need a chair to access it...). The bathroom was fine with a good range of amenities. Also good bath gel and shampoo. Bed, pillows were good. AC was operating well and not too noisy.Breakfast was good/very good with a large choice of cold and hot food and beverage (as Hilton brand is used to proposing). Staff is smiling and customer focused.Outdoor swimming pool is beautiful and long enough to swim properly. Indoor swimmimg pool is smaller, more fit for aquagym. The gym area is separated in 2 rooms (weight and cardio) and well equipped.The parking is free. There is also a gas station in the same area, which is very practical when you have a car.On the whole a good hotel which deserves better windows in the room with view on the road.If you visit Nicosia, no need to use your car.

Our bathroom was large and had a separate shower stall (not all rooms have this). AC worked 'ok'.The rest of the hotel is also designed in a similar style but it looks very classy and in a way it works... no complaints at all! Everything is also very well kept and clean.I loved the fact that they seem to have many 'senior' staff members that clearly knew what they were doing, all very professional, obviously with many years of experience! Wow!!Outside swimming pool (they also have an indoor heated pool) was nice and refreshing and very clean and well kept. Nice staff as well. The large, well kept garden gave it a feeling of space as you were allowed to place your sun beds under the trees for shade.Breakfast was a true 5* experience with -again- wonderful staff members that were eager to please. The foods on offer were very good quality (but the choice wasn't as large as at the Hilton Park Nicosia...). The ability to eat outside (terrace overlooking the pool) added to the experience. Loved it!We had a rental car and the large parking lot had many (free) parking places. The distance to the old town was larger than expected but this wasn't a problem for us at all.Wifi was pretty fast and reliable.The executive lounge was without staff most of the day (many executive lounges are) but in the evening there was a very friendly guy (sorry I forgot his name) that made sure that we always had a full glass and he liked a little chat :-)) The food on offer seemed decent enough (we only had a small taste because we prefer dinner in town in the evenings). The lounge looked a bit 'old fashion' but was comfortable enough with plenty of seating everywhere (pity there was no outside terrace though).The Hilton Cyprus definitely left (only) good memories in our mind and we hope we can stay there again one day.

40,"This is a very large hotel about a 20 minute walk from Ledras street. The location is fine for business etc but there isn't a whole lot around the hotel I.e you'd need to walk a bit to find a coffee shop or high street shops- although they do have a small shop in the hotel.Staff were excellent most of the time. In the restaurant they were a little inattentive. Having asked for the bill on two separate nights it never came and I had to go down to the desk to pay. Also the first night I was under the impression from the matire'd that that night the buffet was my only option; but it wasn't. The next night they tried to push that on me again and I almost had to argue with them that wasn't what I wanted. Food was reasonable in the restaurant but seriously over priced and very expensive.The breakfast is decent enough with a good selection.The rooms were fine and had lots of tv channels to choose from.I would have liked to have used the pool but it's very open right in front of the terrace so everyone can see you having your evening dip! Although this shouldn't really put you off.Overall for business I'd say this is a good hotel - it's very professional, tidy and staff are good and most of the clients from what I could tell were business people but if you were a family staying in Nicosia for a few days, whilst it would probably suit your needs there may be better, more family orientated hotels for you.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 456 Similarity,0.407045789,Review 250 Similarity,0.481869425
40,"I spent 4 days here on business. The hotel is very nice in many respects. Rooms are very well kept, service is excellent, as is the lavish breakfast buffet. The outdoor pool is really beautiful (and large enough for lap swimming in addition to just paddling around). At the same time, if you're looking for local charm/character, this is probably not the place for you. The location is not too central, either, but it's not too difficult to get to the historic city center.A couple of additional notes. One evening I had the dinner buffet at the restaurant. It seemed overpriced at 30 Euros, but the food was really rather good, and dining on the patio by the pool made it even nicer. I discovered that there is a large park around 300 yards from the hotel, next to the old University of Cyprus buildings, which is very nice for a peaceful morning stroll or run (perimeter loop is almost 3 miles). On the negative side, the price for internet access is ridiculously high. We know that it's primarily the more expensive hotels that charge for internet access, and this looks like gouging.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 1055 Similarity,0.295803989,Review 526 Similarity,0.476910483
40,"We decided to spend our Christmas at Hilton in Nicosia.Our choice was mostly defined by the dogs we brought with us.When booking online, their website had an option: with or with pets.Later on I canceled my reservation and a friend of ours who was also coming with us made another reservation to qualify for a good deal, the deal I had missed when placing my reservation. So then my friend called the hotel, the receptionist was not sure if the dogs were allowed, to us it sounded a bit misleading (as spending Christmas with our dogs was our priority). at the end the receptionist checked with the manager and they confirmed that the dogs were allowed for some extra charges (50 EUR per day), (although our young Yorkshire Terrier ladies), are very tidy, tiny, cute and clean) fair enough!When we arrived and went to our rooms, we soon discovered we were in a part of the hotel which lacked the amenities corresponding with its five star rating. It was obvious that the rooms had not been remodeled for quite some time. This observation of ours does not necessarily describe the whole hotel but our rooms; as we then assumed we were given those rooms because of our dogs.The staff was very friendly and helpful.The food was great, really great!The Christmas dinner was also good, we expected it to be much more festive though. ( I do not want to sound like a spoiled brat, but we still expected the Christmas dinner to be a bit more festive even though there was a financial crisis).We really had a good time and hoping in the future the Hilton Hotel in Nicosia will provide much more modern room to the dog owner.LAST BUT NOT LEAST, the house made muffins were some of the finest pastries that we had ever eaten.

50,"I spent 3 memorable nights at the Hilton a couple of weeks ago. There was no way that I would get to Nicosia and book elsewhere. Steadily top of every other hotel in Nicosia, it prides for its high standards and goals. Indeed regarding this year’s World Travel Awards the Hilton ranks first and has secured not only 1 but 2 Awards as the Leading Hotel, and also the First Leading Business hotel in the entire island. Undoubtedly it is the best choice for a hotel in Nicosia.LOCATION: Centrally located on one of the highest points of the city. On foot, it is a pleasant 15 minute stroll to the shopping area. Taxi fee €6.00 to €8.00. Buses #158, 160 or 166 from right outside the hotel take you to Solomou Square for €1.50. Use the Intercity green buses for Larnaca for €4.00 - 45 minutes. For Ayia Napa, Limassol or Paphos (€5 to €7 one way) the bus stop is a few metres on the opposite side.CHECK-IN: Efficient and swift. The bag was carried upstairs much before I came in the room.STAFF & MANAGEMENT: When I return to the Cyprus Hilton I feel like home. I have several friends and many acquaintances here so the welcoming is always warm. Regretfully due to the detrimental financial climate that Cyprus now finds itself in, alike many other businesses the Hilton had also been influenced adversely and I noticed people from the staff missing. The unity and understanding of the staff struggling even with less people to meet the demands of their guests impressed me. I came across optimistic people, positive energy and high spirits -the spirit of Cypriots in times of turbulence. An unbeatable team, many of whom are multilingual experts and the percipient observer notices instantly the value of these people and how they perceive to make guests feel at home. You don’t have to be a repeater to feel this exceptional personalized treat. You feel it even if you come here for the first time. The human side of this hotel is remarkable and makes the difference.INTERIOR: Classic touch of luxury, elegance and glamour that travels you. It pays to go around and spot these details yourselves. Starting from the impressive lounge where guests can take their afternoon tea over the sounds of soft music, to the Paddock bar for a drink and its relaxing atmosphere. Then walking towards the lifts there is no way you expect them to be so ostentatious but they are and it is a fact. On the way you come across some awesome boutiques which the hotel houses on the ground floor promenade. You might get the impression that everything out here costs a fortune but on the contrary I have noticed some excellent bargains and the prices are reasonable.ROOM: Being a frequent guest I was upgraded to a King Hilton Executive, a 30m² room. There was a long welcoming message left for me on the big flat TV screen, and a laptop on the corner desk table. I noticed the WI FI was way faster than the previous time I was here a few months back and using it now was like working from home. The demanding businessman can find no other accommodation of such comfort, with so many functional amenities, eloquent silence in amazing ambience in the whole of Nicosia.The balcony overlooked the side of the pool. The usual warm tones of the interior, spacious and airy, impeccably clean and comfortable. I could not wait for the afternoon, the time I was enjoying my 2nd cup of coffee the sun flooding the room with light creating a warm and pleasant ambience. The king bed huge and soft with big fluffy pillows guarantees a good night sleep. Amenities like coffee/tea facilities, audible alarm, a huge flat TV with both standard Network & Premium (HBO,CNN, ESP). An iron board is always handy, a minibar, two phones one with Dataport. Delivery of local Newspapers plus a Video Cassette Recorder.BATHROOM: A good size standard in general bathroom with tiled floor and walls, a marble wash basin and a hand-held shower, but nothing clamorous. Toiletries are outstanding (Peter Thomas Roth) smell tangerine and favourite of mine, but I have to admit one tube of shower gel is too little. The size is small and the content of this small size is by far not enough. (Call housekeeping and you will have one or two extras). Bigger in size toiletries are given to the Really Top Executive Suites though!Robes, slippers, and the usual amenities like a magnified mirror, hair dryer, scales are provided. Due to this bad financial climate in Cyprus, (guests should have this in mind and be understanding) several of the ladies I knew in the housekeeping had to be dismissed. I missed Elena’s Oltu amazing decorations in the bathroom and bed. She was dismissed with several more. These extra touches of housekeeping service are missing. If you need a late afternoon housekeeping service, just call. Otherwise this is not at the moment provided…at least I have not seen the afternoon service during the time I was here. I also urge guests to let the management know of a demand they have instead of waiting until they get home and write a negative comment. This can only break the spell of your holidays.BREAKFAST: Breakfast is taken in the Fontana, the Signature Restaurant of the Hilton, popular in the entire island. Not even once had I read something negative regarding the Fontana. Breakfast was rich and adequate as always with anything one could imagine. There were plenty of normal/healthy option counters on hot/cold dishes. There is so much out here, enough to fill you up till dinner. Nice presentation, impeccable service, excellent quality.LUNCH/DINNER: The buffet lunch/dinner options are highly recommended. There is such a variety of everything that you cannot try it all. Quality is excellent, the service top, and tastes are yummy. If in the meantime you really love to eat, don’t bother get to a restaurant outside the Hilton because with much less you will realize that you are in a paradise of gastronomic bliss -the choice is extensive that you could ever wish for.THE A LA CARTE: The popular poolside bistro summer restaurant “Pergola” prides for its exquisite a la carte dishes. I have dined here a couple of times. If you visit the Hilton in the summer I urge you to dine here even for once….the experience will be memorable!THE FONTANA: With some friends we tried the a la carte menu of the Fontana this time. The salad that impressed me more was the Baked Goat Cheese Salad for €18.00. (Assorted Greens, Dry Figs and Cranberries, Walnuts & baked goat cheese served with balsamic & honey dressing). I can totally live on salads and I can say it was luscious. (The restaurant offers interesting choice of Vegetarian food as well).My main course was the Fresh Salmon Escalope served with Jumbo Prawns in Lobster sauce for €36.00. The side dish was spinach Timbale, Steamed Carrots, Parsley Potatoes. A dish I highly recommend to everyone who appreciates good food.My friends had the ‘Garidomakaronada’ - Jumbo Prawns with Tomato & Fresh Basil Sauce served with Tomato Spaghetti for €38.00. The dish was so tempting and I had a bite. It was a marvel -a dish to be considered.Cypriot wines are of excellent quality and we had the Aes Ampelis Rose (a Shiraz and Maratheftiko grape variety) served at €34.75 (per bottle) €9.00 (per glass).Another exceptional wine from the indigenous Xynisteri grape is ‘Petritis’ probably the most interesting dry wine that Cyprus has to offer at the moment, the unique wine to accompany seafood. A delightfully tasty wine and one of my favourite. It is served at the price of €28.25, - €7.50 per glass.For meat dishes highly recommended is the Kyperounda Cabernet Sauvignon. It leaves a sensuously lingering aftertaste and it is of excellent structure and full flavoured. It is served at the price of €44.25 (per bottle) and €12.00 (per glass).If you are at the Hilton you can accompany the above wine with the Baked Lamb Rack with Mustard Sauce. This dish is served on baked vegetables with herbed potatoes for the price of €33.00. An exceptional dish that meat lovers will adore it.EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: A complimentary option of snacks, beverage and dessert with breakfast included. All guests of the executive wing have access to this smart lounge which is quite popular. In reality it provides snacks and nibbles. (Of course coffee/tea facilities, bottled water and juices, bars of cereals and fruit are provided the day long). Comfortable and cozy ambience to relax, read a book even work on the computers that are provided there. It serves also like a work/study room.HHONORS: Late checkout upon availability, Free use of the Hiltonia Health Club, Local Newspaper and many more are only a few of the benefits a member can enjoy.THE HILTONIA CLUB: Unbelievably popular with locals because it has everything one could ask for, but unfortunately there are times when it becomes really noisy out there. I used it daily this time, talked with passionate members but I believe these members should learn to follow some rules. Equipment and facilities are of high standards but if there is such noise …I am really sorry!The Steam Bath, the Jacuzzi, the Sauna & Indoor Pool are the other facilities that I used extensively and they are excellent.From the long list of therapies I can recommend the Executive Massage. My therapist Elena managed to release all tension with her techniques and the result was amazing. Try it if you can afford this extra pampering.WI FI: It is free in all public areas including the outdoor pool area for all guests -not a fast connection though! It is free in for Hilton HHonors Gold and Diamond members only.WEDDING VENUES: The first and best hotel that is so popular with wedding venues in Nicosia. You see, weddings are a big social event in Cyprus and are inherent in the culture.In a nutshell, it was another memorable stay. If you want to pamper yourselves, do spend some days out here. Keep the good work up guys and thank you for making me feel like home.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 880 Similarity,0.450287265,Review 137 Similarity,0.450985343

Use a hire care but, be warned, the car parking at this hotel can be a nightmare, especially when there is a conference, exhibition or wedding.The hotel is in two parts. The original building houses the standard rooms. The in room Hi Fi is free if you are a Hilton Honors member and book the room on the Hilton website.The 'Executive Wing' was a later addition and has the Executive Lounge on the 7th Floor. This hotel can be very expensive at certain times of the year but, is usually empty and cheap in August.There is a great outdoor pool and the leisure facilities in the basement of the Executive Wing has an indoor pool.The breakfast room has indoor and outdoor seating in the Summer months. The breakfast is superb and the standard of service excellent. There are no international newspapers available in the restaurant, only Greek.The Fontana restaurant does an excellent buffet at lunch and dinner and, also has frequent food events. They regularly give a voucher on arrival for bonus points to your Hilton Honors account when using the Fontana restaurant.The Executive lounge is large and comfortable but the computer facilities are limited. The evening buffet is always excellent but, along with a small number of other Hilton's, have now restricted the 'Happy Hour' service to beer & wine - in this case locally brewed Carlsberg & Le Piat D'Or - forget a vodka tonic or whisky on the rocks. There is no FT, NYT or local English language newspapers - only Greek.The staff are excellent and the standard of Housekeeping is high.

10,"Having spent two weeks in the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus travelling via Larnaca, I turned up at the airport to return home to find that the aircraft had technical difficulties and hadn't left Glasgow. Facing a long delay, we were herded on a bus to the Hilton in Nicosia about an hour from the airport. A lukewarm buffet dinner welcomed us with a warning not to touch the mini bar. It was after 10pm so I went to my room and got ready for bed. I logged in to the internet as you get a code via the TV which welcomed me as Mr Thomas Cook. Obviously I had to contact my family to let them know what the script was and did so via Facebook messenger. In the morning we had a meeting with the rep who said we had to vacate our rooms for 12 noon. I went to reception to do this and was met by the most sour faced individual ever. Have you used the mini bar? Have you used the internet? No good morning or did you sleep well? I used the internet and he demanded 9.95 Euros which I didn't have. He then went through a list of currencies or payment methods and I told him I only have Turkish Lira which he seemed to baulk at. I can appreciate that he may have been a young boy when the civil war took place (maybe I'm being too generous here) but his attitude was appalling to say the least. This must be the only Hilton Hotel on the planet to refuse a currency.... 'we do not accept it!' I was snapped at. When I said you can take it or leave it, his frosty face turned to stone...lol.

Aside from being prompt about her job she also answered several questions we had. We fell in love with a ceramic piece on display at the hotel counter...She directed us into town by calling a cab to find that particular ceramic we were looking for and knew exactly which store to obtain it from. Unable to find it there as it was discontinued we spoke with her when we returned. She then LITERALLY found management- which was the General Manager of the hotel- and asked on our behalf if we could have the display that was at reception- HE SAID YES! Unbelievable effort on her part! We spent two nights there and each morning on our way to breakfast she made it a point to greet us and make sure there was nothing else we needed during our stay.She also sent to our room a small patisserie plate full of Cypriot goodies! We just had to write about her and at the end of our stay we simply had to give her a farewell hug! Employees such as this are rare and it just shows Hilton does its best when hiring!

30,"We visited the Hilton Cyprus in Nicosia for 2 nights (30th December until 1st of January), overall the hotel was okay, and I can rate the stay as okay as well; but to be honest it was lower than what I expected from a 'Hilton' hotel. Being to too many 5 stars hotels around the world, this hotel is a 5 star but has nothing special about it. Maybe the bad impression was caused by the renovations that were happening in the hotel lobby , but I noticed that there was no concierge, no valet parking, and from the reception to our room we had to go through two different building blocks and 2 elevators. The breakfast is less than 5 stars for sure! and when we ordered breakfast to our room, we found the glass of orange juice to be dirty.I will not complain much since the price that we paid was relatively low, due to a sales promotion.Finally, to be fair to the hotel, the location is ideal (in the heart of Nicosia, close to shopping district, the mall, and the old town). Maybe after all i have to blame it on the city, because what I have heard that the city doesn't have a lot of hotels, and this Hilton is the only 5 stars hotel in Nicosia.Bottom line, book it if there is a promotion",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 1028 Similarity,0.440385506,Review 178 Similarity,0.395347746

Decent gym with a reasonable number of good machines with video screens. Fact remains, I booked it on account of its indoor swimming pool. This indoor swimming pool is very heavily trafficked. The hotel helpfully provides you with a timetable so you can see when there are no children's or adult classes scheduled in it. However, during these ""free swim"" hours, quite a few guests descend on the pool. Around four people can comfortably swim laps in this pool, and you might find more than four people trying to do that in a given ""free swim"" time. The water temperature is also rather warm (I'd guess around 84 degrees F), but that's to be expected in a hotel pool.

40,"We were staying in Pafos and wanted to have a casino night so booked the Hilton Cyprus using HHonors points (bringing the price to £40 per room) so we could cross into Northern Cyprus.Upon arriving the hotel looked very nice. Designer shops are present throughout the lower floor with designer goods displayed all the way down to the Foyer. Unusually this hotel has its reception on the 2nd floor so don't go looking on the ground floor thinking you missed it.The reception staff were friendly and helpful and automatically upgraded us to executive rooms (as we were gold card holders). Upon entering the rooms, they were spacious and reasonably well decorated, however for a five star Hilton I did expected a higher standard of furnishing especially for an executive lounge. It seems this hilton just did the minimum it could to meet the 5 star criteria. To stress the rooms were not at all bad, just I had higher expectations from 5 star Hiltons due to staying in the Park Lane hilton.Anyway during our stay we made use of the executive lounge which serves free alcoholic beverages until 8pm (the employee was kind enough to leave the food out a lil longer and give us a couple of bottles of wine as we arrived at 8pm unknowingly) - which was much appreciated.Upon entering the bar area downstairs I asked to play the grand piano. I was advised that the one in the main sitting area was not for use, however another grand piano was available that I could play in the smaller bar. This of course pleased me greatly and I serenaded my friends for a few minutes on the piano before heading off to the casino.In the morning we visited the spa facilities. The gym setup is kind of inconveniant with the pool being in a seperate area from the jacuzzi. sauna and steam room and also having two changing rooms. In the end I had to walk back and fore the reception area in my swimming trunks dripping of water so I could use the steam room after my swim.The girls ordered room service and were happy with the food and the breakfast in the morning was of a very good standard, although some potato scones would have made it perfect.All in all a pretty good stay and if this was a 4 star hotel it would have got full marks, only reason is that I expect the executive rooms of a 5 star hilton to be furnished to a higher standard. Also although good value for money when using my points, the right price of the executive room per night at short notice was 290 euros. I don't believe I would have been happy if I had paid that price.Tip to all booking early in 2012. Hilton Cyprus is in the Hilton Point Stretcher Rewards, so you can get the room for next to nothing for only 17,500 hilton points.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 1021 Similarity,0.415277124,Review 240 Similarity,0.390559895

30,"So, I've stayed here around 5 times. I've always considered it luxury. This time, not so much. The problem is that it's fine - but expensive, and way too expensive for ""fine"". It's a business hotel, quite far from the centre of Nicosia, so it needs to be worth staying for business. The lobby is perfect for business meetings, but the only free wifi in the hotel is in the lobby. It's 7 euros for 2hrs in your room - and while it used to be cumulative so 2hrs could last a couple of days of quickly checking email between meetings, it is now a constant period. It's 15 euros for 24hrs, and when you're paying 155 euros for a night (without breakfast), that seems a little bit cheeky. The breakfast buffet is good - but not worth paying on a walk-in basis, but the pool bar seems good value (17 euros for a cheeseburger) until you remember that it wouldn't be good value anywhere other than a hotel that's already stupidly expensive. Over 5 euros for a coke or a filter coffee, and it becomes an expensive stay. While I'm on business, I don't believe in wasting my business's money on paying for wifi when it should be free. The bathroom in my room is a bit out-dated and could be modernised quite easily (a better shower would be a good start); and some of the rooms have a really rubbish view for that money. Bizarrely, when I checked-in, I was told I had ""a very nice room on the 4th floor"". It really isn't. This may be petty (but I'm paying 155 euros a night) but: 1. there's nowhere to easily put cosmetics for getting ready in front of the mirrow. 2. If you're using a hairdryer or straighteners, the plugs are in a strange place, unless you're going to dry your hair in a steamy bathroom. 3. There are no power points near the bed. I use my phone all day, every day. At night, I need to charge my phone while also using it as an alarm - I don't think I'm alone in that. 4. Crappy view.I'm falling out of love with this hotel - I used to look forward to it, but I guess I've found hotels around the world where you get much more for your money. If this hotel is going to continue being a business hotel, they might want to start considering offering free wifi throughout. It's 2013, it shouldn't be too difficult.

Also there was free WiFi all around the hotel.Breakfast was excellent, with multiple choices for a vegetarian like me... hot immediately-prepared according to request waffles are offered to guests..However, the most important thing to be mentioned is the hotel staff.. all were very welcoming and friendly, smiling and helpful.. they would notice any need of yours and immediately come and offer help, without waiting for you to ask .. specifically the staff at breakfast they were excellent and super friendly.I highly recommend this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 404 Similarity,0.43528575,Review 186 Similarity,0.372161464

Not to be confused with the Hilton Park, which is more to the outskirts of the city, the Hilton is slap bang in downtown Nicosia meaning it is ideal for business but also for getting out and about the central part of the city, the walls, Ledra street and close to some good restaurants.The hotel itself has good restaurant, large bar area, great outdoor pool - especially if temperatures are rising, but also an indoor pool and health club.Rooms are good, service friendly and overall a hotel I enjoy returning to.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 1085 Similarity,0.263752189,Review 575 Similarity,0.37208055

50,The Hilton Cyprus delivers what you expect out of a Hilton and more - very comfortable rooms. Excellent meals in a beautiful poolside setting - with a view of the hills from the balconies. It is a short taxi ride away from the old centre of Nicosia where the life is - so to say. One little word of warning. Check on which network your mobile is roaming. If you have an EU sim card you will get a nasty surprise in your bill if your mobile roams on to the Turkish network which is easily accessible here due to the proximity of the border between north and south. Better to actively choose the network you are roaming on if you're staying in this hotel.

40,"I had a pleasure to stay 3 nights at Hilton. I have to say it was great experience. All staff was more than helpful and friendly. Especially staff at breakfast restaurant was amazing, their hispitality was outstanding.Polish chef made me pancakes every day (delicious! Ask for those and you won't regret), got fresh squeezed grapefruit juice every day, there were a lot fruits and veggies (good option for vegetarians, but vegans will also have chance to have good breakfast). Also, food at room service was very good. I've ordered grilled halloumi cheese with tomatoes in pita with french fries and I have to say it was good match (even tho there are not many vegetarian options), service was very quick. Good was bit pricey, but definitely worth the money.My room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. Bathroom was not the biggest, but big enough. Amenities were great, I asked for shaving kit and vanity set and I got fiew of them. Ladies who cleaned my room were very, very nice and helpful.Outside swimming pool was little bit too cold by then, but the inside pool was perfect (note that there are various activities in that pool, so it's not available all the time - especially when they have toddlers swimming lessons. After which pool smelled a little like a smelly diaper), empty almost all the time.Stay at Hilton was one of the best, even I was on business trip there, I felt like on vacation. The only minus I have noted during my stay: I had no free bottled water in my room.

50,"I always stay at the Hilton when visiting Nicosia and on my recent business trip I spent 4 memorable nights out here.You see, it is not just a superb hotel with an air of grandeur and classic splendor, but it happens to be the island’s flagship hotel. A top-notch five-star and top choice of world leaders and VIPs who can be spotted sipping chilled beverages or dinning at the signature restaurants of the hotel. So easy to bump into them.AWARDS: Just for the record –Hilton Cyprus has been recognized as Cyprus’s Leading Business Hotel for the fourth consecutive time at the 23rd edition of the prestigious World Travel Awards, recognized across the globe as the most prominent and comprehensive benchmark for excellence in the industry.LOCATION: Only minutes’ walk to the city center, at one of the most upmarket, leafy avenues of Nicosia. Taxi fee to the heart of the shopping center costs €6.00 but buses pass by every 20 minutes as well. On a nice day, it is a matter of 15 minute walk.CHECK-IN: Quick and efficient.SERVICE: Top notch! I felt the Cypriot hospitality at its full, felt valued and respected and enjoyed high quality personalized service from the staff and management. I skip many names as they are so many, but extra credit goes to Michaella, Marta, Stelios the Executive Chef and Christos Ioannides.AMBIENCE: Elegant, classy and so inviting and friendly at the same time. From the Gucci bags to the Cartier jewelry, the Hair and Beauty Salon, the impressive lounge and ostentatious lifts, the interior, -facilities and sumptuous furnishings in general, give guests the option of never having to leave the hotel.SUITE: I had the corner King Junior Suite # 569. Extremely spacious and nicely furnished with partial city, pool and garden views.It was more like a luxurious apartment actually, (67m²/721sq.ft) with a separate living room and a bedroom furnished to the highest standards of the Hilton quality and style.With access to the Executive Lounge and high-speed internet I was totally spoilt the 4 nights I was here. Nothing was missing, an eloquent silence in an amazing ambience and with so many friends around ….what’s not to like!Flowers in the room, a platter of fruit and wine were mostly appreciated.From the stunning king-sized Hilton Serenity bed that assures a restful night’s sleep, the writing desk, the two plasma TV sets, the coffee making facilities, iron/iron board and many more, it is hard to find fault.Crispy bed sheets changed daily, fresh towels, fluffy robes and slippers and Yes! The decorative towel folding that adds a fancy element and an extra feel of pampering is back. A huge thanks to Maria Christodoulou the supervisor of the Housekeeping but also Dora and Nandia who looked after my suite.Convenience here blends with comfort and reality mingles with fantasy, only to create the unique atmosphere and the perfect balance between luxury and homely familiarity. I could go on and on writing about this experience if it wasn’t for the word limit.HILTONIA CLUB & SPA: I never bothered stepping out of the premises or felt the need to get to any of the several restaurants that I was invited for a tasting experience. Moreover, there was no reason to do it.I spent most of the time sunbathing by the beautiful pool, used the fitness center once and the sauna twice.Downside, the Jacuzzi and steam-room. I felt it was a waste of time to remain in both since the pressure of the first was extremely low, and similarly the power of steam was so little, reminding me similar steam we have at home after a hot shower. Both need attention.Finally, the so called ‘relaxing room’ has only the name.It has to be furnished and decorated accordingly, while ladies should be strictly prohibited from leaving their belongings exposed out there, otherwise there is no reason to exist in the state it is now.TREATMENTS: The beauty centre has a tantalizing Spa menu to help energize and relax, depending upon your special needs. I went for the 60 minute Time Interceptor facial (€75.00) –Face, neck and décolleté area, but I also had the Classic Back Massage (30 min. €50.00).Elena my professional therapist for years, eased away the muscle tension, and when I left the treatment room I felt like I was walking on air.With all this pampering and care, I want to thank the team of the Spa, Pieris and Elena.BEAUTY SALON: Zak Hair Designers & Beauty Saloon is based at the Hilton and is extremely popular.You can relax knowing that your new hairstyle (men and women) is in the capable hands of qualified professionals whose aim is to deliver a complete hair and beauty experience from hair cutting and styling to waxing and more.I had been neglecting my hair lately and took some time while here to treat myself a fresh new look. I felt pampered and special and let Andy give me a trim while Fivo gave the coiffure hair-do.Whether you just need a trim or a colour refresh, or are in a mood for a dramatic makeover, one visit here, will have you feeling fabulous and turning heads!EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: Residents of the executive rooms and suites can benefit from this specially designed area where they can enjoy complimentary breakfast, tea, coffee, cakes, canapés, but also alcoholic drinks & cocktails, selection of fruits, newspapers and Internet access.This year after a long time the lounge evokes once again a pleasant and friendly atmosphere and has regained its old glamour.RESTAURANTS: Breakfast here is a delectable feast and is taken at the Fontana. There’s anything one can imagine, plus healthy options appealing to guests with specific dietary preferences.FONTANA RESTAURANT: (All-day dining)At a pleasant and chic interior with a cozy ambience, breakfast buffet was an utter delight and the service top notch as always. Waiters, were on hand at all times, even cooks and chefs were out daily. Team work and a personal approach with guests.DINNING: I was here with friends dining out by the pool and our choices were from the a la carte menu. (Readers can find my extended review about my tasting experience under the restaurant’s name).CHARITY EVENTS: Similar events take place quite often here at the Hilton. I experienced one such while I was there. Together with several other guests we tasted delicious cakes over a cup of coffee or tea. The money raised was offered to DM Thomas Foundation to help transform the lives of young people across Europe.ROUND AND ABOUT: Almost everything of interest lies within the historic walls, where a labyrinth of narrow streets reveals churches, mosques and evocative colonial-style buildings.The Archaeological Museum with its extensive collection is considered the best in Cyprus and shouldn’t be missed. Designer shops and upmarket restaurants are in abundance, while buses and taxis are never far away.Nicosia is an enticing city and is ideal for experiencing what modern Cyprus is all about. The ancient walls, traditional restaurants and an increasingly vibrant and young cafe and cultural scene effectively showcase the city’s basic make-up.IN ALL: The Perfect city retreat! With stylish rooms and suites, sumptuous furnishings, fine dining, squash and tennis courts and proximity to Nicosia’s Old City, make for a tempting package.

I had access to the executive lounge, which offers virtually almost a warm dinner (pasta, salads, warm food, beer and wine) from 5 to 7 p.m. There is no breakfast in the lounge, but for those staying in the executive floor there is a breakfast free of charge in the restaurant downstairs. I only missed some international newspapers in the lounge. There is a free internet in the lobby. It might be a good idea to extend it to the lounge (even if there are two computers with internet connection there).The room was very nice and comfy. My room was towards the street, but on the 6th floor I was not at all disturbed by the traffic. The minibar is quite basic and the bathroom could be more modern, but both of them were just ok for me. The television set is a bit oldish, I missed some tv channels, including the German RTL and BBC.I enjoyed very much the swimming pool. Although it is not huge, it is large enough for swimming. There are also two different saunas (Turkish and Finnish), as well as a whirlpool. I appreciated very much that this hotel maintains separate saunas for men and for women, as I have some negative experiences from the mixed ones in other countries.The Hilton breakfast is excellent with a nice view towards the outdoor pool. Also the bars and the restaurants looked nice, but unfortunately I found no time for them. I am quite sure that I will return to this hotel on my next visit to Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 757 Similarity,0.491436093,Review 47 Similarity,0.34663942

And the premises are nice - if you enjoy the classic and comfy style of American top hotels, you will like your stay even in Hilton Cyprus.What annoys me, is the way a top class hotel charges for services that ought to be free and considered basic services by now. My example: 6 euros/hour for the use of WLAN!? Why on earth? Even cheaper hotels are willing to provide something as basic as that - mostly without any further charges. Just like airports, department stores, cafés et.c.WLAN/WiFi is merely a necessary tool for any professional. Do us all a favor, and simply include the wireless connection in the price of the room.

40,"We, two couples, spent a week at the Hilton Cyprus just before Christmas 2012. We decided on Cyprus and Nicosia to get some warmth and sun, good food, and see interesting historic places. We decided on the Hilton because of it had reasonable winter prices and seemed a good ""home base"" for visiting Nicosia and the rest of the island.Some of this worked out very well.We stayed in Executive Rooms looking toward the pool and used the Executive Lounge daily. The rooms were nicely furnished and provided all the amenities expected from a upper level Hilton. The hotel grounds are well maintained and attractive. The outside pool, though open, wasn't used during our week since it was cool and rainy all week. The Hilton has wonderful and helpful staff. Maria, at the front desk, deserves a special mention for us because of her unceasingly friendly and helpful acts along with with problem solving skills.We assumed there would be real tour buses available for us tourists to see the numerous sights around the island since we didn't want to drive. Unfortunately, at least during the winter months, that's not the case. We did use a service of a tour guide one day for an informative trip to Paphos and Limassol. Though the guide was good, the four of us were crammed into a Nissan for 8 hours. We decided to avoid that experience again. So, we spent some of each of the other six days in Nicosia. We took a taxi in daily and wandered around. Unfortunately, there's not a week's worth of things to see, eat and/or do in Nicosia on rainy December days.The Hilton helped us through the problem. During our fairly frequent down times, we used their available services. We had massages, swam in the indoor pool, got hair styling and wandered through the small local shops. The interior seating in the lobby area provided a comfortable place for sitting and talking. Except for the one evening a large Russian crowd quickly drank all the booze and emptied the appetizers, the quiet Executive Lounge served as our ""living room"" with drinks and appetizers freely available before we went down to dinner.My complaint with high end Hilton hotels (world-wide) is their consistent high charges for internet services, 15 Euro daily. Many European hotels are getting more computer friendly and charging little or nothing, but Hilton hasn't budged. Breakfast was included in our room price and it was very nice. There were plenty of options, though they couldn't make a decent hollandaise for eggs benedict, the plain scrambled eggs on the breakfast bar, were superb. An English breakfast was available at the bar along with a variety of breakfast items. I ate a lunch buffet one day but learned that, unlike the dinner buffet, you're charged much more if you get something from the cold and warm side of the buffet. There's a separate charge for dessert and it's per person. We ate the dinner buffet one night, but found ordering off the menu was a better experience. Dinner and breakfast service, like the other areas of the hotel was superb. There wasn't a server who wasn't friendly and efficient.You can not beat the experience of the Hilton Cyprus in the Nicosia area. It was spotless and service was grand.

For a family of four, we were given two connecting rooms.Considering that they had 300+ people dropped on them at short notice, we were presented with a good quality evening meal followed by breakfast and lunch the following day.The rooms are of a good standard with comfortable beds, a well equipped bathroom, although toothpaste would have been handy and a well stocked mini bar. However, prices deterred me from using this facility.The ground floor has some interesting little boutique style shops to explore as well as some glass elevators, providing you don't mind heights.The outside pool is a great size and well equipped with plenty of sun beds. There is a facility to get towels, which is really handy. The poolside bar offered a great range of refreshments but with beer or soft drinks starting around €5 and a sandwich starting around €14, we again declined. However, it's fair to say that if, unlike us, you were planning a stay at the Hilton then you probably have an expectation around the associated prices.Finally, considering everything that occurred in our 24 hour stay, the staff were most helpful, pleasant and accommodating.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 664 Similarity,0.319504825,Review 466 Similarity,0.327805034

The bathroom was lovely with crabtree and evelyn toiletries and was clean, shiny and luxiourious with a complimentary fluffy bath robe and slippers to use . The mini bar area looked very nice. was presented nicely and had its own lighting. Was was great about this suite was the many different light controls you could choose for effect-there were different profiles, profile 1 was dim with brighter highlights, profile 2 bright, profile 3 a highlight effect ect, or you could adjust the lighting manually. That was a nice touch. Both the bedroom and front room had flat screen TV with a good amount of channels, with films ect. The front room had sofa and seating areas arranged in a circle pattern-lots of chairs to sit on each with their own style, again in a tradditional theme which others may find dated however i quite liked it, had enough of the minimalist square block theme you see in many other modern hotels. There was a unit with several interesting books to read about Cyprus and a large midi hi fi system that we could use, never seen that before that was great! as mentioned before a flat screen TV and a central music system that you controlled by a switch inc volume control which played music from celing speakers-great! the balcony snaked round from the front room to the bedroom and was clean, but needed updating. You could entertain people in this suite for sure.the hotel grounds had a luxurious professional feel to it with a hairdresser, bank, business shops and a small supplies shop. This hotel was definitely aimed at the businessperson being in the capital city and had several conference rooms. To reach the excecutive suite area you had your own beautiful glass lifts.

Their Buffet Breakfast is generous and versatile, the staff are all super friendly and helpful and the location is very central.They have an outdoor and indoor pool, which is an advantage.The hotel can use a few touch ups on a few areas, like the executive lounge upgrade.All in all it is probably the best hotel to stay in while in Nicosia...",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 488 Similarity,0.373704659,Review 327 Similarity,0.298210026

20,"We booked an executive suite for two nights as a special treat for me and my husband.. the room was really good (spacious and clean) but that was the only Hilton-standard experience for our stay..All the rest were disappointing:-They were charging us €15 for 24 hours internet access for our room.. We were paying for an executive suite with access to the executive lounge; we could have free internet access in public places but NOT in our room, despite the charge rate.... In many other Hilton hotels across the world, internet is complementary...-Breakfast selection not that great and bad service. We were just greeted at the entrance but then we were left to choose our table and also to search for the waitress so we could have hot drinks (coffee and tea). There was no milk left on our table for tea (both mornings), so again I had to ask for the waitress to bring me more. Is this expected from Hilton?? No I don't think so.- Room service is hilarious: we ordered a margarita pizza to share with my husband and a bottle of wine.. In my opinion it is one of the most simple option for room service. They called us 10 minutes later to say that they were out of pizza(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). We ordered something alternative and then when the food arrived, they only brought 1 glass for the wine.... and this is a ""5"" star hotel...-Prices overall were expensive and not worth it.. We wanted to order room breakfast; breakfast was included in price we paid but the room breakfast menu included very few items that were included in the price. In addition, there was extra charge €12 per person for room breakfast plus a €3.5 charge for the room service and extra charges for the breakfast selections. Even though we didn't go for the room breakfast, the breakfast at the restaurant was not great either (as commented above).If I knew better I would have booked somewhere else; If you are attending for a seminar/course, location is a good but all the rest is not worth it.Hilton management most probably will not comment on my review, but for all of you travelers do make a good search for other hotels in Nicosia!!!This is so disappointing, given the standards of other 5 star hotels in the island...",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 774 Similarity,0.394664881,Review 290 Similarity,0.295901341

They need a serious renovation though since they look quite old and heavy. When staying there you dont really bother to look at the old doors or the dated carpet floor since the rooms is offering everything you need.Breakfadt was included in the room price but it was nowhere near to a 5star luxury hotel. Had better breakfasts at 4star hotels many times. Comparing it to other 5* hotels it feels really poor.In any case the breakfast is usually included in the room price so take advantage of it.I have been a member of the hiltonia fitness club for the last 3 years so i can write a couple of things on that also. The outside pool is just perfect. Great atmosphere, calmness even on summer Sundays that gets a bit crouded. The inside underground pool is really small though and not always at a good temperature during winter. Thr gym is quite good. A bit crowded from locals that are members of the fitness club so dont expect easy access to all the facilities at all times.The outside pool bar serves great coffees, coctails, juices but a bit pricey. Not much compared to coffee shops in Nicosia and Limassol.The serious problem is when it comes to dining at the pool bar-restaurant or even ordering food to eat on you sunbed.The prices are close to 2 Michelin Star restaurants in France or Spain. Just unacceptable to serve pool bar food on plastic tables and sunbeds and charging it double the price of good restaurants or bar-restaurants in Nicosia or Limassol. Never eaten there and not planning to.Overall the Hilton Cyprus is a really good experience. Pricey but good. Certainly not value for money.Would recommend it for business trips, anniversaries or 1-2 days stays for higher budget tourists that want to see a bit of Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 987 Similarity,0.236249769,Review 631 Similarity,0.262586078

40,"In Nicosia, I usually stay at the Hilton Park, which I have reviewed -- I said there weren't any really good hotels in Nicosia and, although the first tier wasn't as good as it would be in other cities, it's good enough and the Hilton Park is in it. On this trip, I decided I wanted a change, and especially the possibility of a better breakfast, and so I tried the Hilton. It is better than the Hilton Park, but it's also quite a lot more expensive and the question is: is the improvement in facilities worth the extra money?I can't quite make up my mind. Service here is good, but so it is in the Hilton Park. The rooms here are a little better, the breakfasts are quite a lot better, the bar is marginally better and there is a choice of restaurants, which the Hilton Park does not have. I didn't eat in any of them, though, so I can't comment on quality.With one exception, the staff are friendly and helpful. I decided to ignore the one exception -- an older man (about my age, in fact), who responded to my request to extend my stay by an extra night in a way that astonished me. Okay, they were full, but a simple ""I'm terribly sorry, I wish I could help but I'm afraid we're full"" would have been fine. I did not expect to be treated as though I'd asked him to pimp his granddaughter. I think, though, that that is simply his manner and I'd guess he's senior enough that -- although they must be aware that he is no PR man for Hilton -- no-one feels able to retire him.I'm left with the question I started with -- is it worth the extra money? -- and I still don't know. But I have to go back to Cyprus shortly and the fact is that I'll probably choose the Hilton again. So I suppose I must think it is.

It has a very high level of specification, with everything you need for a relaxing stay.Apart from breakfast, we ate in the Fontana restaurant most nights of our stay, and we couldn't praise it highly enough, not just for the quality but also for the value for money. The only problem we had was that the al a carte meals were so generously proportioned, that we never had room for desert.All the staff were very welcoming and helpful, and made you feel like nothing was too much trouble.There is only one point that was annoying that we would like to raise, that we had difficulty parking on many occasions due to the number of parking spaces being taken by non residents who were coming to use the gym, so we think that a certain number of spaces should be reserved for residents only.We would highly recommend anyone consider staying at the Hilton Cyprus, as it is perfectly placed for business or pleasure.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 942 Similarity,0.429668924,Review 199 Similarity,0.257151425

50,"I visited the Hilton for a business meeting in October.For 43 consecutive years it stands as a symbol of exclusivity and a luxurious landmark. It won the award of Best City Hotel in Cyprus for the second consecutive year, voted by readers of the Conde Nast Traveller Awards 2010 under the category of ‘city hotels/ Cyprus, and was chosen for its high level of services and irreproachable hospitality. It also secured the first place as the most popular in the same category. It is the hotel that spoils and pampers its guests. This happened to me on this trip.I felt like home and I am not exaggerating. Starting with the staff who are surely professionals and multilingual they know well how to make their guests feel like home.Personally, I postponed until the coming trip to Cyprus, 3 dinner invitations I had in the city those days and chose to remain in the premises.I had a spacious room (#555) on the Executive floor. Here rooms are much bigger than the Hilton guest rooms and I felt so relaxed and comfortable not only from the amenities found here but the soft colours, décor, and its minimalistic style and touch of luxury. There was nothing exaggerating and all amenities functional and useful.The bed was huge and lovely just as I expected it to be with huge fluffy pillows. There was a mini bar and just above a separate open space with shelves for glasses, wine, and some delicacies on offer. I found the corner desk with the laptop very functional although I had my own and I spent much time out there working while at the premises.There was a flat TV with ample of local and international channels to choose from, and one of the two armchairs was next to the side table with an impressive lampshade and coffee facilities. This spot had become my favourite corner for my afternoon coffee when I wanted to watch the news. The emphasis in the whole premises is on elegance and comfort.The huge mirror in the bathroom made the room seem bigger but it was spacious all right. Toiletries (Crabtree & Evelyn) collection, and when I asked for one or two more I was brought a handful.The Hilton knows well how to pamper their guests with some VIP courtesies upon arrival. I had a surprise indulgence with fruit and a bottle of some red wine at first. Minutes later I had a plate with Cypriot delicacies in syrup and later some white roses were brought from the cleaning lady for the bathroom creating in minutes a pleasant ambience in this room! Later on, in the afternoon there was another knock on the door, this time I was brought some snacks. (Make sure to put the safety chain behind the door because some male waiters just knock and enter even before you answer).Guests with rooms on the Executive floor have access to the Executive Lounge on the 6th floor. A beautifully decorated room with fitted carpet comfortable sofas and armchairs creating different private corners, soft pleasing to the ears music, and open for the executive guests free for dining, drinks and nibbles.The most demanding guest will be pleased with the more than adequate American breakfast offered here. A variety of cereals, dry fruit, omelettes, sausages, mushrooms, pan cakes, ham and bacon, grilled Cypriot cheese (halloumi) yoghurt, rice pudding, different kinds of bread, croissants, biscuits and cakes. Everything is of excellent quality and taste and always under the supervision of professional staff like Gregory’s and many more.Dinner at the stunning (seasonal) Pergola Grill and Bar Restaurant, -the latest addition to the Hilton by the pool the last night of functioning was a challenge. The Executive chef Adreas Georgiou with the rest of chefs and cooks seem to work miracles in the kitchen. The presentation of every dish brought was like a piece of art. The exceptional culinary standards, the taste and ambience set the scene for stylish dining in soft pleasing to the ears music. Andreas Yiallourides is another asset for the Hilton.Another favourite spot was the Spa where I tried to combine business with pleasure. The Thai massage I had was so comforting and relaxing, but the Jacuzzi, the Steam bath and Sauna were just as good. I was amazed to see so many locals who are members and come here to exercise and spoil themselves. I consider it one of the most luxurious health clubs in Nicosia.Internet is not free here, but it has become a standard benefit (free of charge) for HHonors Gold and Diamond members only. It is a hotel geared predominantly to the business clientele making it an ideal meeting point, with just a 20 minutes’ walk from Nicosia’s highest points.So, with all the above it is not surprising that the Hilton in Cyprus consistently ranks as the international business community’s first choice.

40,"Firstly an explanation of why we went to the Hilton. We tried to book a package tour of North and South Cyprus, but the tour company without reason cancelled the January departure. We decided to do the tour independently using Expedia for the travel/hotel package, which was just ONE QUARTER the cost of the package trip.We flew to Larnaka from Gatwick,and took the Shuttle Bus (8 euros pp) to Nicosia. The Shuttle bus stops outside the city. IT IS NOT WALKABLE IN THE DARK- so we took a taxi (7 euros) to the Hilton.The following were 5 star:a) Reception -Andreas very helpful and later arranged an excellent taxi trip to North Cyprus- Kyrenia & Bellapaisb) Our room -King Hilton Guestroom on 7th.floor overlooking pool -clean, well-stocked, very comfortable bed.c) Facilitiesd)Sumptuous layoute) Extremely helpful cashier Phediasc who in true spirit of customer care sorted out a problem with our bill- he is an asset to hotel.So what reduces its star rating in our opinion:1. Breakfast at 20.5 euros is expensive. This can be reduced by buying breakfast vouchers to 15 euros- but BEWARE if you buy these you are expected to have breakfast every day. We had breakfast the first day but the hot food was ONLY LUKE WARM-not pleasant. We drew this to the attention of the restaurant staff and to reception. We did not return.2.The hotel is 2 km outside the city. All other 5 star hotels in such a situation provide a free shuttle bus to/from the city. This Hilton does not, possibly because a lot of their clients have cars, can afford the 7-10 euro taxi fare, or if thrifty take the 1 euro bus ride- OK in week but very sparce at weekends (Buses 116,158,160 go to main bus station at Solomonos Square).Use the INTERCITY buses from here -very cheap- buy ONE DAY ticket = return.

This room with a view on the pool was already of the normal Hilton standard, i.e. good.I still don't get it: why do these hotel chains still charge for internet? At cheaper hotels you get it for free, while here you need to pay €15 per day.I need to use it for work, so it will be reimbursed to me, but this internet only works reliable in the room. In the lounge, bar and pool the signal is not everywhere strong enough. So, if you are being charged for it, make at least sure that it is available everywhere!I selected at first login a 3 day package. When I checked out before going to breakfast, and going back to the room afterwards I still needed to use the internet, but it was already disconnected. I had to go to reception and 'beg' to give me another hour for free. This resulted in a lot of effort for the staff.Even more effort was required during my second stay....here I was upgraded to the executive floor which has free internet....at least that was told to me at check-in. At checkout it was of course charged...Again a discussion was needed to remove the internet charges from the bill.At the same time somebody else checking out also complained about the wrong charging of it...When at the executive floor you have free access (with your room card) to the executive lounge where drinks and food are for free. Nothing to complain here, but I don't recommend taking breakfast here. Go to the normal breakfast as the choice is more extensive there.This 'normal' breakfast is very good! Plenty of choice in drinks and food, fruit and everything you might need for breakfast.Very small detail, but I found the beep in the elevator for every floor you pass annoying. Specially when you have to go to the highest (executive) floor :-)In the executive room there is a laptop, so if you are HHonors gold you don't have to bring your own...Avoid a room at the street side, like 660, as it forces you to sleep with the windows closed and therefore the airco on. Not my preference.By rental car it is easy to find, just follow the highway from Larnaca that becomes a dual carriageway when entering Nicosia. Straight ahead until you see it in front of you.

My partner has been before and went since with his mum and aunt. His mum has walking difficulties and the staff were very welcoming and attentive.Most of the stafff were really lovely and the two that weren't may just had a bad day! There was only one little incident as when we returned from the pool, we were locked out of our room. The key card didn't work anymore and my partner had to go to reception in his dressing gown while I was standing around on the corridor. Otherwise all did run very well.We are going again in less than four weeks and I can't wait to relax after a very difficult year. I hope we will have just as good of a time as last year.

The room we were in could have done with a lock on the door leading out on the balcony though. It was rather old, although quite well maintained. Excellent breakfast and good scrambled eggs.2 negatives here though - the wifi - it was charged for and the signal could have been far better - also I had to keep logining in despite having bought 72 hours - and also the cost of beverages... Well I thought Greece was expensive but they were charging 5.70 for a single cappuchino or tea and a litre of local water cost 4 euro in the lobby bar and 5 Euro in the room.

Unless u want to change in one of the two showers. On arrival we were met by a girl who said the spa reception wouldn't be manned until a little later when our treatments started, we had to ask for towels and wernt offered a robe or slippers which we thought was unusual. Once in the spa /pool area it become apparent it wasn't really a suitable place to relax. There is no reclining seats / chairs there are 3 sofa type chairs that you have to sit up right on. When it gets a little busier there is no where to sit. The pool and Jacuzzi was luke warm at that not the normal hot temp of a Jacuzzi. The sauna / hammam is nice but if someone is in there you have to wait as they normally lay on the stones on the floor there really isn't much room for someone else in there at the same time if sharing with a stranger.The therapist doing the treatments was very nice but didn't really speak English so it was a little difficult to get across certain things about the treatments, we wernt asked to fill in any consent forms stating any injuries or allergies which I thought was extremely dangerous, luckily i was able to communicate about a lower back injury u had and neither of us have any allergies. The treatments were done very well. We are at the bar near reception & the food was very good & good value.Overall it was an average time at the Hilton we have been to nicer spas in Cyprus whilst living here. Somthing that would massivly improve the spa area is having more seating around the pool and chairs that recline so people can really relax.Another tip would be a sign up on reception when a treatment is in progress asking for a little quiet, part of my treatment involved a loud conversation going on in the reception area which wasn't very enjoyable.Overall if they made some small changes too the spa area I feel it would be somewhere we would go back to in the future.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 218 Similarity,0.211057941,Review 668 Similarity,0.123737645

40,"It is actually the best thing you can find in accommodation in Nicosia. This and Hilton Park, however, this is more close to the city.

Never on the reception but sometimes in the bar or restaurant.",The Landmark Nicosia,Review 893 Similarity,0,Review 823 Similarity,0
