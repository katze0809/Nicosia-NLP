20,"I am rating as below average because during my last visit, we had booked for a suit and we stayed unhappy. Yes the room was big, yes the breakfast was satisfying and the staff friendly BUT we weren't able to use the bath because there was a problem with it and the water from the bathtub kept leaking on all over the bathroom floor. I am sure if i had ignored it and took a bath or used the jacuzzi (it was a jacuzzi-bath) the leak would go all over our room and outside of the suit. Because of the late in the hour that we realized this we didn't request for a change in the room but we notified them the next day and they said they will check it.Since we stayed only for one night we didn't have the chance to see what they would suggest we do (change room etc).Nevertheless after this experience i don't think i would ever take my chance with this hotel again because i highly doubt that the leaking first occurred on our visit since as soon as we opened the water, water started coming to the bathroom floor without any delay. This is not something that the cleaner could ignore during their regular cleanings of the bathtub, the cleaner should have realized that it was heavily leaking and either ignored it or told the responsible person about it but instead of them to arrange for it to be fixed, they just let more people to stay there. Either way it was very disappointing.",Semeli Hotel,Review 49 Similarity,0.065653216,Review 136 Similarity,1

30,"Booked 5th floor double room with fridge, kettle etc and balcony and breakfast -accommodation great with clean room but hard pillows and when asked for feather none available but that is a minor thing. Breakfast absolute minimum and bland fruit salad basically apples, orange and apple juice not fresh although both apples and oranges are in season on the island and therefore really cheap. Other fruit not great quality and no oranges were ever available as fresh juice or to peel. The coffee is self service from a machine and no decaf - you have to pay around 3.50 euro per cup. I asked to speak to the manager several times but he never contacted me. Reception staff otherwise very helpful. Shame no local foods are reflected in the breakfast choice and no communication available in case of a complaint as I felt I needed to make - it is a 3-4 star hotel but felt much less in what I have mentioned above.

40,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The review from Iola S is a bit strange as the Hilton is 100Eu per night more expensive for b+b so check the price for yourself.The hotel is aimed at the business market, so had a quiet feel to it as people seemed to take evening meals as room service and were out fairly early in the mornings. However the hotel would also serve as a good base for tourists visiting the city. A pleasant 15 min walk or approx 6Eu taxi ride gets you to the old town.The hotel is obviously new, the public areas are very pleasant and the hotel has a nice look to it. The guest rooms and the public areas are very clean. The breakfast was fine, a buffet with the usual hot and cold food. We ate in the restaurant twice in our stay, the food was reasonably priced and there was a choice of snacky foods (toasted sandwiches with fries) or more substantial 3 course meals. On both occassions our meal was good, well cooked, tasty and plenty of it.The staff were, without fail, friendly and helpful. Following a fall and a swollen ankle (watch out for the pavements in Nicosia) as we limped back into the hotel and explained our predicament the staff went to get some ice wrapped in a towel to use as a compress (and again the next day).The leisure facilities are limited to a gym and sauna. The gym looks brand new (unused brand new!) with a good range of equipment.The only thing that we weren't too keen on was the lighting in the rooms, corridors and stairwells. The corridors and stairwells used a motion detector to switch the lights on, so when you entered these areas they were initially very dark at night time. The lights came on quickly but it looked a bit unwelcoming. In the room the lights were LEDs. These are very directional so the rooms ended up feeling a bit gloomy without a wide spread of light. I don't think you get full spectrum light with these either but that's a minor gripe.The bathrooms were a little on the small side, but had all the toiletries that you would need. The shower was over a bath - but the bath didn't have any taps. Maybe you get these in an executive room !Overall a clean good quality hotel.

30,"Stayed here for a week with my job and could write a lot but will focus on the most relevant aspects. There are two main reasons why I rated this beautiful hotel as a 3 and not a 4:1. The lousy wi-fi.2. The bad sleep due to the thin walls.Wi-fi did not work very well in our rooms or in the conference area. It kept losing the connection.VERY thin walls! This means that it is very disturbing when staff and guests talk in the hallway or if a guest is watching TV or having a conversation. Even a small cough will make its way into your sleep. Bring earplugs or count on being woken up by people either out late or up early for breakfast/housekeeping.Other things worth mentioning: Bed is very comfortable and AC worked well. Most of the staff is super nice and helpful, especially Aliona (who is working in the restaurant) and Paola (front office manager). And room service was very quick.Breakfast is OK even for vegetarians/vegans but the hotel had a hard time ordering soy milk. But after a couple of days it finally turned up! :) The hotel also serve lunch and dinner, and have several vegetarian options on the menu.Quiet area, not many restaurants around the hotel apart from their own. Either walk 15-20 minutes or take a taxi to find more options.Conference venue is in the basement which means no windows. They actually moved us between different rooms from one day to another without informing us, which did not feel that great.",Semeli Hotel,Review 79 Similarity,0.23570226,Review 72 Similarity,0.427393758

From the time of checking to us checking out the hotel was a delight to stay in.Firstly this hotel is spotlessly clean and we had no issue with the décor the lounge was comfortable and there is plenty of parking under the hotel.All the staff were fantastic, helpful, friendly and so very polite. Paola on reception is delightful and was most helpful.The rooms are very comfortable, with every amenity possible. Safe, TV, coffee tray, slippers, dressing gown and complimentary shower gels. The beds were very comfortable and I experienced no difficulties with the heating/air conditioning. Complementary wine, fruit and water greets you which is an excellent touch.My mum had a slight drain smell coming from the bath in her room but a brief chat with reception and it was sorted by the time we arrived back at the hotel in the evening.I have travelled to many country’s and stayed in many good hotels and I can honestly say for me this room was by far the best equipped.We ate in the restaurant two evenings while we were there and we found the menu to be excellent and very reasonable prices. The food was lovely and delicious and the waitresses were very helpful and polite.The buffet breakfast offered was excellent: On offer there was toast, fresh rolls, rolls, croissants (choc and plain), fresh fruit, cheese, ham, tomato, cucumber, and a choice of two cereals (muesli and cornflakes). Hot food: Bacon, frankfurters, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, beans, mushrooms and cooked tomatoes. Fresh juice, tea, my favourite was the decent coffee machine!!! What more could you possibly ask for to set you up for the day.The hotel is very convenient for Nicosia for business or other. This hotel is building up a fine reputation and it is well deserved.We had to fly to Cyprus for a family emergency and we had the choice of staying at the Hilton near by, but after reading reviews on trip advisor decided to stay here instead without the price tag of the Hilton.

The reception area is pleasant and comfortable, and there is a decent bar area and restaurant.The rooms are very clean and well maintained.

There is free Wifi in the rooms, which is of average speed, and a kettle with tea bags and instant coffee is provided. The highlight of the room is the great shower, which has multiple settings including massage and can also be used as a sauna. One weakness of the room is the limited space for the toilet in the bathroom, you are quite squashed between the shower and the wall, and if you are built large you are likely to find this a squeeze.

We booked this hotel as it did not seem far from the General Hospital.We arrived at the hotel about 1315hrs, parking underground was not possible as the car park had been cordoned off with card board boxes, I mentioned this to the Receptionist, Paula, by the time we had booked in and got to our room she had telephoned and arranged a parking spot for me in the underground car park, excellent service.The hotel is clean and spacious and the rooms are very clean & tidy, beds are really big and comfortable. The touches in the bathroom of comb, toothbrush, sewing kit and the usual assorted gels was well received. The shower was really powerful, welcome after a long drive in humid conditions The staff are very polite and courteous, only too willing to help.

I did however expect more from the rooms given that it's rated 4.5 by travellers. Despite having a suite, I did not find it overly impressive- and the bathroom could definitely do with modernisation. The continental breakfast was satisfactory but nothing to write home about. In summary, I think it's a reliable choice for a good stay in Nicosia but don't expect a high end hotel. Parking is secure underground, and the walk into the Old town is not too far (no more than EUR 7 for a taxi ride either).",Semeli Hotel,Review 71 Similarity,0.333333333,Review 45 Similarity,0.306381677

The general manager was a valuable person to us for the past year supporting our dream and helping us make it real. The reception hall being glamour and classic on its own needed only few details, the dinner hall being modern and sheik allowed us to create our vision. The service we got, the food and beverages on both halls were remarkable... It's been a month and we are still getting compliments for it from our guests. It was the best value for money choice as we made with good and affordable prices we had the best service. The suite and rooms for our guest... Fabulous! Clean! Relaxing! Everything you need after the long day! We truly thank the general manager and the staff for their services, friendly ness and support to our special day. We truly recommend Semeli Hotel!

As a tango dancer I went to Semeli Hotel with my friends to join the milonga.As we were hungry, we wanted to have a meal at the restaurant of the hotel. I was not very enthusiactic about the hotel food but there was nothing else to do.Thank God we had no other alternatives otherwise we would never be able to experience such a good taste. We had Pink Lady which was salmon and homemade Semeli burger. They were both fantastic. I would like to extend my compliments to the chef from here. He/she is a great cook.. Definitely... The price?? Very reasonable...15 Euro for a fantastic salmon meal and 8.50 for the burger in a very clean and presentable atmosphere..The amount of the food was so big that I couldn't even finish all ( as a big eater):)))I also heard that there is an open buffet on Saturdays when there is enough crowd and it is fantastıc as well for 15 Euro..We had a great milonga in a beautiful hall with great and reasonable service.The cleanliness of the hotel was exceptional as well.",Semeli Hotel,Review 168 Similarity,0.143019388,Review 106 Similarity,0.125195771

Freshly made food, local specialties, sweet temptations and limitless coffee make the best way to start ones day.Apart from that, the all day function of the restaurant together with the excellent lobby and main bar ""surroundings"" make Semeli Hotel an ideal venue for a descent business meeting.Last but not least the excellent stuff!
