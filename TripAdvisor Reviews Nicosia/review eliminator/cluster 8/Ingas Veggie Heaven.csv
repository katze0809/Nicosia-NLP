40,I ordered through the app. They delivered on time. The veggie lazania was still warm and tasty. The salad was just ok nothing special .. I did it like so much the sauce at the side. In general it's good.,Ingas Veggie Heaven
30,"Our first impression was the warm atmosphere as we walked into the courtyard. Nicely decorated and inside was homely and we were greeted with a smile.We ordered the beetroot falafel and a glass of water each and sat down waiting for our meal to be prepared. In the meantime we were served 2 fresh homemade bread rolls and a small bowl of houmous which was a nice touch.It didn't take long at all for our dishes to come and it was served with a side salad, very tasty and filling.We wanted to finish with a coffee each and a chocolate cake to share. The coffee was nice, however the cake was ok and needed to be richer in flavour.The only and major let down was that we were quite shocked that we paid so much to be honest as for a cafe it was unfortunately overpriced. I would have given an extra point for this review if it had been cheaper. We believe that €30.80 for 2 people is very expensive and has put us off returning because of this.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"We stayed by on the way to a family wedding in a nearby church. Such a friendly, lovely welcome with great drinks!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Cosy Atmosphere, we felt like having dinner at our aunt's large home :PThe food was so great and there were alternative options for vegetarians and vegans instead of burgers and salads that most places have. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that they have plastic bottles for water.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
30,"We had the quiche and nut roast. I Found the nut roast a bit bland and unfortunately would not choose again. The curry mushroom sauce didnt pair well with it ether. The quiche on the other hand was tasty and surprisingly light! U get free bread and hummus which is a bonus point! They could do with reducing their prices only slightly, as i would visit again if only the prices were slightly lower. Service was also a little bit cold unfortunately.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"One need to look for it a little, but it is really worth it. Very quiet spot, terrace in summer time, warm any season, and Inga is a perfect hostess with her daughters. Her food is simply excellent and well cared for, creative and tasty. She is originally Icelandic and has obviously adapted well in Mediterranean Cyprus. Try it at least once! We were a family og 4 and nobody left a crunch in the dishes.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"The best Vegan and Vegiteryan food Í ever tasted. Very friendly staff, nice palace and exellent food.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
10,"I was expecting a bubbly veggie moussaka, crackling with energy and smacking of flavour - there was none of this with the meh offering served up by the uninterested staff. It was the last wedge of the tray that had lasted days probably (given the lack of customers) and the microwaving only made it hot. The salad was tired and had little in the way of dressing (and no extra was offered). For 11.90 euros I expected a lot more. The women on duty were only bothered with gossiping together in the kitchen. It was long way to walk and to fork out a small fortune for such a miserable lunch.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"The loveliest people and the whole place is bright, open and a great place to stop for a rest (which is what we did). Only had a coffee and a cake but everything we had was really good and alkl the food we saw everyone else eating looked delicious.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"The cafe almost ran out of food when we arrived quarter past 4pm (they close at 5 pm). We got Shepard s pie, chocolate cake, home made lemonade and some cyprus coffee afterwards. Everything was tasty even for a non-vegetarian. Friendly staff, cozy small terrace - very refreshing place definitely standing out of other restaurants in Cyprus by its style and taste.А вегетарианцам сюда и вовсе прямая дорога. Не так много мест на Кипре, где они могут найти больше чем греческий салат и халуми :)",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,A little gem in the beautiful old town of Nicosia. A lovely cafe with a nice backyard to sit in too. Very good vegan moussaka and vegan lasagna. Super-friendly and great service. A must visit in Nicosia...or even if you’re somewhere else in Cyprus -It’s worth a trip to this part of the city and for green food,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,Best food I had in Cyprus! I wish I’d lived next to the place;) I would eat there every day:) try the vegan frittata!,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,A true gem in the heart of Nicosia. Delicious food and the best owners! Feels like a masterchef just cooked for you in your back yard! Must visit!!,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"We came here as part of a walking tour around Nicosia. What a gem!!. Husband had the spinach & feta pie, I had an olive muffin. Quite large portions so we had of each other’s to try. Really tasty, fresh and a relief from all the heavy meat dishes in other eateries. The weather was nice so we sat outside, but there are seats inside where you could also read one of the local guide books they have for visitors to read while they eat/drink. Recommended",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"Inga's heaven is located in a quieter part of the old town of Nicosia. Atmosphere is relaxed, nononsense and really friendly, with a very personal touch. Food is good, without being outstanding, yet, no complaints. Just good.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Very nice quite place, with a nice terrace. Few dishes, vegan and vegetarian, very delicious. The service is fast and everybody is very kind. Big choice of deserts. They propose also fresh juices.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Vegan restaurants are often hard to find and often disappoint in the quality of the food. Inga's is a little difficult to find but so very worth the effort. I visited today with my sister and brother-in-law. Of the five items on the menu, four were vegan and the lasagna was vegetarian. I opted for the vegan burger. My brother-in-law chose the vegan stew and my sister the lasagna. My brother-in-law is not a vegan but commented that the food was very good. My sister loved her lasagna and I was very pleased with my vegan burger. All meals come with a salad, fresh baked vegan bread and hummus. The vegan chocolate cake for dessert was delicious. This is a family owned and run restaurant. Inga;s daughter was a delight to talk to and Inga;s certainly knows her way around the kitchen. I will be returning to eat here.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"Better to come here for lunch when you can still enjoy the garden around you since this restaurant is located inside a walled area. Around the small court outside it are several artists' studios which are also worth visiting (if they are open).I also recommend going there on a weekday, since there are only 2 people running this operation and the venue is tiny (so you wouldn't expect the service to be as efficient on a busy day).Inga's has a solid variety of veggie dishes that come in generous platters and accompanied by delicious homemade bread.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"INGA's Veggie – Heaven is a cosy, clean, tidy and quiet place with very good service and very tasty frappe and cheese cake. Moreover, it is strategically located for someone wishing to explore the old Nicosia area close to the Archbishopric. Furthermore, there is a Wi-Fi service which is free and effective. One has the choice of sitting inside or outside – the choice depends on the prevailing weather. Will definitely call again.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Nice and cosy restaurant with tables both inside and outside. All meals are vegetarian, most vegan. Our first meal in Cyprus with a good amount of vegetables. Delicious! Friendly service. We would recommend this place!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"My daughter traveled with me to Cyprus for a vacation while I worked. I am vegan and the lunches at my conference were catered and included little I could eat. On the Segway Station Cyprus tour we passed by this restaurant and knew we would return, and we did and had a fabulous meal. Ina's is a small, cozy, informal restaurant. Throughout the week of our visit, my daughter returned to buy carry out meals I could take to work, so I tried a variety of dishes. There usually are gluten free options on the menu. The restaurant is closed Sunday and Monday. If you want the widest selection go early. The owner indicated they make a fixed number of meals each day -- based on historical volume -- and the menu changes daily. Also, Inga's is cash only -- no credit cards -- so come prepared to pay in cash.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"Nice cute place in a quite spot of the old town of Nicosia, with helpful staff and with interesting veggie or vegan dishes. Quite expensive but worth visiting. Next time I will try Inga's sweets.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,We have been twice to this nice small but crowded place. Every time different dishes. We reaaly enjoyed the meals.,Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"Came across this little cozy restaurant in a small street of Nicosia town. Delicious food, had the beetroot falafel with salad and enjoyed it.Some not so good pieces of salad ended up on my plate, so there should be a bit more attention to detail as well as initially store bought rolls were first served, until we asked them to warm it up as it was hard as a rock, they then surprised us with homemade bread. Why not serve this all the time as this could be something that keeps your customer coming back, not the store processed rolls.Anyways, pity they are not open in the evenings, as would be a nice place to have a nice healthy veggie dinner.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"This little gem is slightly hidden but a treasure to discover for anyone of the vegetarian/ gluten-free or vegan persuasion. The place is run with a rare passion and knowledge about food. We encountered a sincere interest in our needs to the extent that Inga went out of her way to ensure that a beautiful gluten-free pie was freshly baked for my coeliac partner on our return-visit. Delicious, generous and guilt free!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"I was very glad to find a place like this in a country where meat is the main food. Nice service, big portions and a beautiful place. A peace of fresh air in Nicosia.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"I am not vegetarian but visited this cafe with friends and was pleasantly surprised - the food is lovely, I had the moussaka and side salad, very tasty and nicely presented; I didn't miss the meat at all.Situated in a beautiful building in Old Nicosia near the Craft shops, Inga's is worth visiting especially to sit outside on a warm Autumnal day away from the crowded city centre.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
20,"I came here due to the reviews, expecting tasty vegan food. While the place was cute and the owners nice, I found the food very unappetising. This is a huge shame, as I am vegan, and I enjoy tasty vegan food. Unfortunately this cafe seems to be taking the healthy, rather than tasty angel on veggie and vegan food. So unfortunately it fits with much of the negative stereotype of bland, healthy vegan food. It's ok to try and be healthy, but they could make the food tasty at the same time and a bit more decadent.We had the vegan lentil moussaka which was very bland and the burgers, which I'm sorry to say were probably one of the worst veggie ones I've ever had. Even the lemonade was disappointing, there was no sourness or taste of lemons in it, just bitterness from the lemon seeds.The only nice thing I had was the apple pie, the vegan 'ice cream' that came with it, was no ice cream at all, more like flavoured ice.It's a real shame that as the only veggie/vegan place in Nicossia, they serve such bland food, I feel it would put most people off ever becoming vegan or veggie, if they associated this food with that lifestyle.Better to brand themselves as a health food place, and not a veggie/vegan place, as I feel they are hurting the cause. Otherwise try to add more richness and taste to the food.Sorry for the harsh criticism, but I am passionate about good food and equally about veganism(, to help the animals, for the environment, for our health etc)so I really want to promote that vegan food can and should be delicious and not just healthy.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,Inga's Veggie Heaven is a great place for truly delicious and varied veggie food. One can say it is a hidden gem as it is located in a not-so-obvious spot in the old town of Nicosia. Inga is also a lovely lady full of smiles and I totally recommend her food!,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Delicious homemade food, beautiful place and really nice staff😊 We loved it! the glutenfree, vegan lasagne was really good. Not easy to find the restaurant, but well worth it😊",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,As a vegan I really enjoyed my visit to Ingas Vegie Heaven while on holiday in Cyprus. It has many vegan dishes on the menu including desserts. The menu is vegeterian and changes daily. The food was tasty and I really liked the pomegranite and ginger drink it's very refreshing. The service was excellent and atmosphere friendly. As a tourist I found it difficult to find the place and note that cards are not accepted.,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,We had one day in Nicosia and haveing late lunch here was lovely. We got nice burgers of walenuts and black beans and beetroots falaffels. And lovely cakes❤️ and people working here and owner was really nice people.,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"The little restaurant is located in the old city in a narrow street. Has enough space inside for 3 little tables and outside they are at least 5 tables. We went there thus far 2 times and me and my wife are amazed by the hospitality and the service we received. I loved the fact that they don’t have a menu but a black board where it has the daily dishes written in colorful choke so romantic like they used to do it in the old days. The prices are normal and they are in tune with the other restaurant prices, it’s about 10 to 15 Euros to eat well which is not bad. All the recipes and dishes are Vegan and also.The place is quiet and cool as weather is concern which is perfect. You can have your juice and your smoothie. Both of the times I had the vegetarian burger and I swear it was like eating a real burger, the texture and the taste was so similar.I have nothing else to say, highly recommended to Vegan that are visiting Nicosia, they don’t work Sunday and Monday though, rest of the days are 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. open",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Its1450 & humid & hot. We walked 4km to find this place which was recommended by my yogi friends from energytherapy, Jamie & Jennifer. Vegan lasagna & beetroot falafel with freshly baked bread settled us in. The ice cool pomegranate & ginger lemonade was exquisite. Waiting for the vegan chocolate cake and ice cream.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
10,"Very nice place, but food OK - and a big but but we were ALL left with upset digestive systems. No sickness, but not good either. Hopefully a one off, but certain this place was the culprit. Beware.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,I walked in and the smell of baking bread filled my nostrils with delight. There's not a huge selection of meals but it's only the two of them cooking and serving and presumably the meals change daily. It's got a nice ambience. They're so welcoming and friendly. It's just a shame they don't open in the evenings.,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Once again a very pleasurable experience at Inga's Veggie Heaven. The food is home cooked, very tasty and served with great care and love. The friendly relaxed atmosphere makes it a great stopping off point if you're visiting the Old City in Nicosia. The two women who run it do so with obvious passion and interest in things vegetarian and it is credit to them that Inga's keeps on going. A real treat if you're in Nicosia!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"Finding a pure vegetarian restaurant in Nicosia was always going to be a challenge but I will eternally be grateful that I found this special place. It might be the only one of its kind in the city, however, I think you may find it tough to find a better eatery. Real home cooking prepared with love and care in a environment packed with positive vibes. Highly recommended.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"the first time we ate in veg/vegan restaurant with a very lovely taste and that we decide that it was possible to come back again.as Italian people, for us is important to feel good with the meal's taste, the dishes color's and presentation balance, the warm and helpfulness of the personnel. Itala, as one woman band, is perfect in her role.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"The food at this restaurant is exceptional! I used to hate vegetarian food but after trying the food here, the recipes, the quality and the presence of the food made me love it! Also the owners are very nice and polite people. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone (vegetarian or not)! Maybe this place will convince you to try vegetarian and vegan food and maybe even love it! <3",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"As a starter I had the soup of the day which happened to be a spicy tomato soup and as a main dish i had the quinoa burger topped with their delicious peanut sauce served with salad, hummus and their freshly baked homemade bread.Excellent homemade food!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"My meal was fantastic , i have ordered Veggie Burger which is a vegan recipe for those who are vegan!!! Atmosphere was excellent, peaceful and quiet and when it comes to service i have to say that is was excellent too!!! I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE TO VISIT THIS PARTICULAR RESTAURANT!!!! IT HAS FOOD FOR BOTH VEGETARIAN AND VEGAN PEOPLE!!!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Nicosias' first and best vegetarian restaurant. Lovingly prepared by the owner your lunch will always be homemade, fresh, and delicious",Ingas Veggie Heaven
10,"Having read a good review in a newspaper, I decided to give Inga’s a try, as I was in my vegetarian week and also in that area. I went for an early lunch, short after midday. Either bad food choice or bad day, but my experience was negative: tasteless food and food poisoning! My symptoms were dizziness for several hours and mouth sore. Inga’s oral menu doesn’t have many options. No written menu, only some dishes names and price on the blackboard inside, and among them, some they didn’t have. From the 2 or 3 oven-cooked dishes, I chose shepherd’s pie (peas not cooked enough, lentils etc; also pie not heated enough). The salad that came with the pie didn’t have walnuts – the lady forgot to add them. No soup (apparently, the reason was the hot weather in that particular day). Juice was ok. While I was there and just before paying my bill, it was only one person cooking, taking orders and serving at tables – multitasking that obviously didn’t work well. I’ll never go again.This was my experience and I wrote this review on the same day I dined there, but didn’t have time to up it.Inga’s veggie “heaven” (what a joke!) is located inside the walls, in old Nicosia, on a narrow street, easy to access by foot from Famagusta Gate corner (Melina Mercouri Hall) where you can park the car.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Inga's Veggie Heaven is my favourite place to eat in Nicosia! It is the only vegetarian and vegan restaurant I know of in Cyprus and I am happy to say that every time I go I get to try something new. They offer phenomenal burgers and I don't think I ever had the same veggie burger twice. They also offer a delicious bread, dip and salad every time! The beautiful setting, friendly service and delicious food make it a must visit place!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"We had lunch there today! The lady who served us was sooo sweet! The food was amazing, well cooked, generous portions! We recommend it and we will definately go back and try the desserts!!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Had lunch there and it was really great. The owner is so sweet and we really enjoyed sitting in the garden - despite some rain. Highly recommended the deserts, the cheesecake was devine!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Cannot fault the food, and a friendly cafe in which to eat or drink and linger. They get busy at lunchtimes so don't be in a hurry. I visited as a tourist but if I lived in Nicosia I would haunt this place. It is marvellous.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"I live in the Old Nicosia,next to Craft Center where you will find shops of craftsmanship and arts,and for a meal or a capuccino and cake,stop and seat at Inga's Veggie heaven.I am not a vegetarian but sometime I need a light but tasty food and this is the place! I like to seat in the small garden and enjoy the quiet atmosphere of this unique neighborough. Inga(owner) and Itala(chef and waitress) are very kind and will explain the menu of the day and the ingredients.Prices are reasonable. A visit to this small and cosy place is worth trying.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"I am vegan, so used to have good food made from vegetables. In Inga's veggie heaven, I discovered new delicious tastes. I highly recommend this place. They welcomed us very well. I'll be back soon !",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Inga's Veggie heaven is really a heaven. The seating outside is in a beautiful veranda garden with a relaxed athmosphere. The food is as fantastic as the location. They were very helpful of pointing out my vegan options. I had a pomegranate ginger smoothie and a quinoa zucchini burger with wild rice and salat. Everything was prepared fresh with love and the taste was just amazing.If you go to Nicosia, Inga's Veggie heaven is the best place to eat.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"I visited this place with family for lunch , was worried at first because it was the first time I eat just veggie food , however I wasn't disappointed at all , everything was amazing and very tasty !!Surely won't be the last time , will come back for sure !Keep up the good work !",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,When you see two middle age european women giving all their love and effort to run a small restaurant in the heart of old nicosia there is nothing bad you should say for that besides keep up the good work!!! Homey vegetarian cooking!!,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,Very nice and cosy little place to have a veggie lunch. Food is exceptionally tasty and the service is as if you're eating in mummy's kitchen. Will definitely come back again!,Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"I read about this unique restaurant in TripAdvisor, and as we were looking for a change to our meat based diet; we considered this restaurant as a good choice.The restaurant is an old house located at the edge of the old Nicosia area, and although the streets are very narrow; there was ample parking space.The reception was wonderful and warm; we sat in the outdoor area surrounded by flowers and the Crafts Center; it was hot but bearable.The Lady was doing the cooking and also offering the Menu on a blackboard that she brought to our table. As this was our first time to this restaurant she offered us to have a small portion of every item on the Menu; it was a great idea.The Bread was very fresh, the Hummus was good, the Mixed Salad with dry figs and pine seeds was tasty but not very fresh, the Eggplant and Feta Lasagna was average, the Curry Cauliflower Stew with rice was superb, the Vegan Asparagus Quiche was fine except that the crust was very hard to cut, the two Veggie Burgers were unique and tasty, the Cabbage Rolls were extremely delicious.The service was excellent, and the prices are very reasonable.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"As a Food Critic I consider it a rare find as it differs from other restaurants.I am always searching for the very best and this humble little restaurant captured my heart from the first bite.Unique in its kind with owners two adorable ladies, Inga and Itala who work with passion and love behind their cuisine and it is this love for excellent taste that they want to share with us, their customers.Located in a quiet neighborhood of the old city, a little out of the centre, but still not that far from the main Ledra Street. Easy to find as it is part of a Craft centre. I was coming from the Cyprus Hilton however, so I was dropped by taxi here for €6.00.Humble and minimalistic interior. Space inside is limited, 3 or 4 small tables the maximum, but customers can enjoy their meals out by the patio at the flowery little garden. The yard is surrounded by several interesting Art workshops which by the way, I urge you to visit while there. Personally, I found them interesting.**Have in mind that portions on my photos are not the normal. I am mostly nibbling and trying the cuisine.FOOD OPTIONS:I had the opportunity to try a few of the dishes starting with the Raw Vegetable Soup that is served cold and is way too refreshing and super tasty. Ideal for the warm days of summer!Salad accompanies each meal and portions are huge. The Mixed Salad I had included dry figs, pinecone seeds and avocado and it was a delight.MAIN COURSES:I tried the super yummy Lasagna and Inga’s hearty Spring rolls which are not similar not even in shape to spring rolls we come across in other restaurants. It is a nutrient roll in a way full of flavour and taste.Be sure to try the Vegetable Burger topped with guacamole. It is way too popular here. Succulent and colorful a burger that I bet you will enjoy and return for more.If you love Indian food, try the vegetarian version of Curry. I tried Inga’s Vegetable Curry Korma and it was a delight. Definitely another dish to be considered!DESSERT:The restaurant prides for its super yummy desserts.I asked for something light to have with my coffee. The owners recommended the Vegan Lebanese Coconut Cream and it was the perfect choice. Mouthwatering and tempting. (€2.50).Of course one can choose from Chocolate Truffles, Ginger biscuits and homemade Muffins and a couple of more.IN ALL: In this tiny cute and picturesque little restaurant I experienced new tastes, made friends and enjoyed every minute of this “Taste Journey” as I like to call it when I am out trying new flavors. I highly recommend this business, and by all means you don’t have to be a vegetarian to visit it, only because there is something for everyone. Come here even for coffee and try the amazing homemade cakes, and sweets!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Finally found an amazing place to eat as vegans! The staff were so kind and helpful. The food was amazing, not to mention the cakes! A bit on the pricey side but worth it if you're veggie/vegan. Shame it doesn't open for dinner and it's not exactly in the centre of the old town but well worth the trip!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,Very small restaurant with deeeeeeeeelicious food. The day I was there one of the chefs acts as the waitress and was very pleasant. Great to be able to visit this place after attempting to have lunch in north Nicosia.,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"Inga's is a rare find! Good honest wholesome veggie food, made and served with care and love! A very welcoming, friendly and relaxed atmosphere compliments the quality food on offer. Very good value for money and a great choice of food and beverages. Sit outside in the soaring heat or take advantage of the shade in doors - either way I guarantee you'll have a meal to remember and rejoice by. Veggie Heaven… it really is!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"So unexpected to find this little gem of a veggie retreat in the back streets of Nicosia. The food was very imaginative, fresh and beautifully dressed and the decor is so warm and cosy, a beautiful place to breathe out and relax in highly carnivorous Cyprus!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,Located in a pictoresque art district walking distance from the main Ledra Street.I felt immediately like at home thanks to Inga ( the owner from iceland) and Itala who welcomed me with very tasty veggie sauces (must to try the raspberry one) and superb burgersDon t miss it and take your time for an exquisite veggie mediterranean meal!,Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"This lovely little restaurant is located in a very charming part of Old Nicosia, with quiet streets and picturesque old houses, and it offers an experience which is definitely very different from the various mainstream places in the busier part of the old town. The two ladies are simply adorable and their food is not only homemade but heavenly, indeed. We were lucky to enjoy delicious vegetarian lasagne, veggie burgers of marvellous texture and taste, nut roast with an Indian twist and truffles made of banana and dates. Don't miss it!",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"After several disappointing meat/fish-free meals in Cyprus it was a welcome relief to hunt out Inga's (in rather a desolate area). Wonderfully friendly Italian chef - she was very welcoming and offered to turn on the aircon for a poor Brit who can't cope with such heat (I sat in the courtyard instead). Tasty, fresh, colourful food. Not cheap (about 11 euros for the main lunch course) but worth it to get non-dairy protein at last.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
50,"From the freshly-baked bread chunks and lightly dressed mixed green salad, to the wholesomeness-packed veggie patties and tasty thai stir fry: we felt positively absolved. Add to that: excellent wine pairing, any kind of coffee, stroudel and banana-date ice cream (vegan), seating al fresco in a quiet square surrounded by craft shops in the old part of Nicosia, garnished with wonderful service. Really, what more could you ask for?",Ingas Veggie Heaven
40,"A small, cute little restaurant which is mostly open for lunch with tasty vegetarian dishes. Vegetarian restaurants are hard to find in Cyprus as the locals are mainly meat eaters so you might as well try Inga's, an Icelander who somehow ended up in Cyprus. With an Italian friend, they not only cook but make you feel at home. Another plus is the neighboorhood which must be visited on foot.",Ingas Veggie Heaven
