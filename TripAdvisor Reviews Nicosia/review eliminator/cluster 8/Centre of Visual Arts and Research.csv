30,"The Centre of Visual Arts and Research (CVAR) is both interesting and somewhat disappointing. I expected to find contemporary (or modern) Cypriot art, but CVAR contains art mainly by British and French visitors to Cyprus from the 1800s to the present. It shows Cyprus through the eyes of those who visited, and those who marketed the island as a travel destination. It also contains a collection of costumes and accessories and details how they were influenced by both Eastern and Western fashions, and its collection of memorabilia includes the last flag that flew over Government House, various bric-a-brac and items from the camps where the British interred illegal immigrants who had survived the holocaust and were trying to sail to Palestine (then under British Mandate). The latter was an interesting find as I have not seen any evidence of these internment camps anywhere else in Cyprus in the twenty years I have been visiting. CVAR's research library also contains thousands of books on the history and art of Cyprus, as well as a large number of newspapers and magazines.Overall, CVAR was not at all what I had expected. Anyone seeking out contemporary Cypriot art needs to find the National Gallery for Contemporary Art at No. 1 Kritis Street in Nicosia. CVAR, on the other hand, offers what I would describe as a colonial gaze upon Cyprus. However, it is well laid out and easy to follow. I would recommend it on the proviso that visitors know what they are getting before they arrive.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,Beautiful museum. Very interesting. It is one of the best museums i have ever visited. We had a guided tour and it was great!,Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"Recommended by our B&B host- fabulous well laid out gallery of 18-20th century art- so interesting to see the way early European visitors depicted Cyprus, fascinating to see places we have visited like Bellapais and Kyrenia before they were developed. Highly recommended.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"This is a wonderful establishment. Entrance fee is low - 5€. An informative audio guide is available for an additional 3€. It is helpful but not essential.The museum has three levels, all accessible by ramps or elevator. The exhibits are very interesting. Much effort and thought was invested in the presentation.There is a small gift shop with nice artifacts.A worthwhile visit to become acquainted with the island’s history.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"A reflection of historical times in Cyprus with paintings, collections and photos. Cypriots must visit this place. Put contribution and support as much as they can. Authorities must use this as a tool for confidence building among the two communities of Cyprus. I congratulate all the contributors and also the people who are in the position of management and ownership.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,A world-class presentation not only in terms of content but design and layout. You learn about the history of the island through the interaction of the artists and their influences.Great cafe.,Centre of Visual Arts and Research
40,First thing - may I suggest to the operators a name change for this fine centre to better reflect its status. It is really a museum concerned with the history of Cyprus as seen mainly through the visual arts eg. paintings/ posters / photos; and textiles eg. clothing. The collection is extensive and well laid out. The information panels are good but we took the option of the audio guide (available in multiple languages and cost 3 euros) which we found extremely useful and interesting.The collection takes up 3 floors so be prepared to spend at least 2 hours here.A visit is definitely recommended.,Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"It is a great place for different cultural events. The new architecture is well integrate in the context, the collection is interesting and the host are friendly and warm.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"You cannot miss this wondeful museum! It perfectly describes the hgistory of Cyprus and It pays tribute to the ""bi-communal"" nature of the island. It includes 4 floors with a diverse selection, along with an easy to understand summary of Cyprus' timeline in a wonderful, informative, participatory way through beautiful art and memorabilia.The paintings, clothing, and artifacts tell the chronological story of the Ottomans, Greeks, British, French, and others who have lived on Cyprus.It's a hidden gem nestled amongst the quiet area of Nicosia near the Farmagusta Gate, in a fun neighborhood with some beautiful homes and interesting galleries nearby and I believe you won't regret the visit. It is a very beautiful and well organized place with a great modern design, and a cozy atmosphere. The tour is interactive (as you are encourraged to open and explore the drawers and cabins) and you cannot fail to visit the magnificent Glafkos Kliridis library situated on the top floor, as you can feel ""a part of history"" there. In the base floor there is a nice cafe and little boutique with lovely gifts. CVAR is the Grand Prix winner of the 2017 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award. Well deserved!",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"This museum is unique. It pays tribute to not just the ""bi-communal"" nature of Cyprus, but all the communities that make up this mosaic country. Its wonderful, participatory way of presenting the history of Cyprus, and including presentations by Greek, Turkish, Armenian, and other Cypriots makes this vibrant place come alive. Don't miss it!",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"This new and immaculate museum should be better known, as it is the place to come if you want to get a true sense of historical culture in Cyprus. Set on four floors, the museum takes you through Cyprus history by means of paintings, some photographs and scenes of Cypriot life. Essential if you want to get a view into the soul of Cyprus",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"Don't miss this wonderful museum, perfectly detailing the history of Cyprus in informative way through beautiful art and memorabilia. Plaques in English and 4 floors with a diverse selection, along with an easy to understand summary of Cyprus' timeline. Nestled amongst the quiet area of Nicosia, it's a hidden gem rarely visited by tourists, but it should be! Director is also a delight to talk to. You won't regret the visit and worth every cent of 5 Euro entrance fee. One of me favourite experiences in all of island!",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"It's been a pleasure to discover this unique, well organized and welcoming museum in the heart of Nicosia. A beautiful place with a great modern design, and wonderful, cozy atmosphere. There is a wealth of knowledge about Cyprus art and culture to be acquired in just over one hour of lively, dynamic guided tour by the passionate owner, Rita Severis. Nice cafe and little boutique with lovely gifts included. Children love it and came back to bring their parents after seeing the museum with their school. Also organizes beautiful cultural events in the evening. No wonder CVAR is the Grand Prix winner of the 2017 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award. Well deserved. Don't miss this hidden treasure.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
40,"CVAR located at Ermou street in Nicosia. Interesting collection and Nice place to review Cyprus arts and history: paintings, clothings, books, etc",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"The CVAR, as it is known, is a museum dedicated to all Cypriot communities giving you a glimpse into their specific lifestyle. You will see paintings, clothes and a section with vintage items of daily use. The best would be if you managed to visit when there is a guided tour. Also look out for events, like ""How to read a painting"" or music/theatre. It recently won a Europa Nostra award.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
40,"The Centre has been designed in a smart way, with emphasis on the bicommunal character of the island.It holds regular events on history and culture. It houses a cafe/restaurant. Good quality but somewhat pricey.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"This gallery is small but wide ranging, with an excellent display of paintings connected to Cyprus, either by the subject matter, or the artist having been born or having spent time here. Both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot artists are represented, and a wealth of others who have passed through; we were stunned to find David Bomberg here, and Denis Peploe, among other Europeans. We particularly enjoyed the collection of Gladys Peto illustrations. Would thoroughly recommend.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
40,"Well organized arts center. You learn a lot of history with the vast range of exhibits they have. I recommend visiting when they have an event! Last one i visited was the ""bridal fashion show"". Amazing!! They offer food and drinks at their restaurant and of course they have a roof garden with an amazing view!",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
40,"Former President Glafcos Clerides office, books desk are here. The military uniform of apast British Governor General of Cyprus is here. Eclectic collection up to immediate era. Restaurant with tasty fare on ground floor",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"It is definitely worth seeking out this museum. It provides a fascinating and comprehensive view of the last 300 years of Cypriot history. The audio guide is first-rate and worth the price. You'll learn how different waves of visitors have viewed Cyprus and its people--and how their prejudices and politics affected their viewpoints. The paintings, clothing, and artifacts tell the chronological story of the Ottomans, Greeks, British, French, and others who have lived on Cyprus. This is a brand-new museum and beautifully laid out. One of the two best museums in Nicosia. Make the effort to find this place! The cafe (and the rooftop) offer delicious food. It's also in a fun neighborhood with some beautiful homes and interesting galleries nearby. (If you live in or near Nicosia, the annual membership is a good deal.)",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"This gallery is full of the most wonderful art works, as well as traditional costumes and historical pieces from the days of British Colonial rule. Well laid out and informative over 3 floors with out being overloading the senses. It is set a little out of the ""tourist"" area in Ermou Street near the Farmagusta Gate but definitely worth a visit. Of course there is a wonderful cafe/courtyard where you can relax and refresh with great food before heading off.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"where to start?.... the building has been extensively renovated to the highest standard.. so much thought has gone into how to present all the exhibits.. even the ones that arent on display ..... it flows... from era to era and what is on display constantly changes ... the exhibits themselves are wonderful, you are encouraged to open drawers to see what else you can find to look at .. staff is available to answer questions and if you are lucky mrs rita will be there to escort you .. my mother is in a wheel chair and rita pushed that wheel chair all over the museum... the small shop is full of the most delicious really non touristy things and the restaurant is very good.. there is a research library constantly receiving new books, articles etc .. just about my favourite place to be in lefosia",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"If you enjoy historic views and colonial history, CVAR has an outstanding selection of paintings, photos and posters from all the travellers, explorers and invaders of Cyprus. There is often a special exhibition, also. CVAR is a research facility and has a library. There is a café. 5euros etrance",Centre of Visual Arts and Research

50,a gallery that is abpou the history of Cyprus and not paintings only.Agreat collection of adds clothes the dinner china set of the governor that was used during british times a big library and a very nice caffe The entrance tee is only 3 euros,Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"The exhibits in this collection gave us a better overview of Cyprus's relatively recent history than we had managed to accumulate during the last fifteen years of visiting the country (20-30 visits--our daughter lives here). Informative and entertaining at the same time, and the attached restaurant is a bonus. We shall return!",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"A little Gem, fascinating, progressive - you can combine lunch, coffees, snacks - whatever takes your 'fancy' - with a walk, even better a guided Tour, around the fascinating building, exhibits giving some excellent insights into the long and fascinating history of Cyprus. Not toomany holiday makers will make it here - yet ! - but it is becoming one of Cyprus' little gems. Well worth visiting!",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
40,"I loved this place. We were lucky enough to have a guided tour - the centre comprises paintings, some dating back to the 18th century, etchings, some furniture and household items and authentic costumes from all parts of society. It encompasses Greek and Turkish traditions and history and how they intertwine. A really interesting hour. Its also in the old town and has a great cafe for lunch at the end of the trip (see reviews for Balthazar). Recommended as part of an old town visit.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"Great exhibition with unique items, very educative for students to adults. Great food at the in-house restaurant, great terrace, perfect for hosting corporate and other events. Most importantly very helpful and kind stuff",Centre of Visual Arts and Research

50,The collection at the CVAR is fascinating and the staff is highly friendly and professional. The two hours we spent there were the best two hours we spent in Cyprus during our visit. Well done!,Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"Fantastic experience! Despite having great exhibits, most of museum of Cyprus cannot boast up-to-date display and look pretty old-fashioned and uninteresting. However, visiting CVAR is a completely different experience. The museum is very modern, the display is awesome (even the ramps are used as exhibition space) and the exhibits they display are of great value especially if you are interested in the history of Cyprus. If you are lucky to have a tour done for you by Rita Severis, it'll definitely make your day and you will fall in love with the place.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"We spent a wonderful couple of hours taking in the varied art, memorabilia and objects in this collection through which the viewer can take in aspects of the complex history of the island. The owners of this unique Centre are dedicated to bi-communal engagement which is reflected in the balanced and sensitively curated collection. This includes not only the historical art, but costumes and memorabilia from Turkish and Greek Cypriot life all carefully preserved and associated with the periods and styles of the themed floors. I was delighted with the playful interpretation of life in Cyprus in Gladys Peto's Art Deco drawings. David Bomberg's expressive, strongly coloured paintings are a departure from his earlier work. Plenty of fascinating surprises here - the Caterina Cornaro Room, the artists work out of the Jewish internment camp in the late 1940's, the cartoons and tourist posters, flat drawer files of immaculate embroideries (think V&A). The building also houses a Research Library with a collection focused on the Middle East and Cyprus. We had a lunch of Sea Bass and spicy lentils at the in-house café Balthazar - very reasonable and very good! Don't miss this Centre whether you live on the island, as I do, or are visiting. The area is a gem to wander about in with its restored houses (or otherwise), workshops and lanes.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,One of a kind gallery in Nicosia that both locals and tourists should visit. Contains a great collection of paintings (spread over 4 floors) showing cyprus (scenes from all over the island) of the 18th-20th century through the eyes of visiting artists. Very interesting. Very well laid-out. A great outing for the whole family!Something that was really missing from nicosia.,Centre of Visual Arts and Research
40,"I recently visited the Centre with my 8 year old grandson and we were both amazed by the art on display and articles of a past era such as costumes, photographs, books and of everyday use.The place is unique in its conception and it is evident that its founders did not spare any efforts or money in presenting to the general public their collections.When in Nicosia, do not miss it.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"We were alerted to this outstanding new place on a walk around Nicosia arranged from the tourist information office. The ground floor had a temporary exhibition and then the ramps up to the floors were lined with political cartoons, lithographs, travel posters and pretty much any painting or picture related to Cyprus. Each floor had amazing original water and oil paintings, costumes and other paraphernalia about Cyprus. We met the owner and her husband whilst we were there. They have been amassing this amazing collection since 1984, sourcing the works from all over the world. It is difficult to describe the extent and variety of the works contained here: come along and see for yourself. You won't regret the €5 entry fee as this is absolutely unique.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,Recently opened and magnificent. This new arts centre is housed in newly renovated buildings close to the buffer zone in old Nicosia. The theme is Cyprus through the eyes of foriegn artists and there are 4 floors crammed with wonderfully varied images and costume. It's all accessible by ramp or lift. I really like the way they have written all the labels in Turkish as well as Greek and English. There is a small but very nice shop and an excellent café. It's independently owned and run. I rate it as a must-see for Nicosia.,Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"The CVAR is the only Cypriot venue of its type in Cyprus - bicommunal and inclusive of all the people of the island. A phenomenal gallery of quality art, historical pieces and very cosy and rich in stories, colours and eye openers. The restaurant and bar/cafe linked to the CVAR (Balthazar's) is one of the best on the island, and in good weather, has the best rooftop venue in town! Can't get enough of this place and have picked up the new annual membership card for a bargain! Thanks all for a wonderful place to hang out and interact, especially the research centre as well!",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
50,"This is probably the most extensive collection of books, prints, lithographs, photographs and paintings connected to the region and Cyprus. A wonderfully restored old 'han' that now is both a museum and a great place to meet socially - excellent food in the restaurant and a lovely rooftop bar (in the summer) with fantastic views over Nicosia - and a continuously running slide show of photos/videos in the collection, transporting you back to the 1920s, 30s and 40s for a real flavour of how Nicosia used to be - and how it has developed.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research
