Our waiter suggested to us a rose wine and it was a perfect choice. The service was once again attentive, and the atmosphe relaxing.

It also has a outside seating for smokers. BUT when it comes to food itÂ´s realy very much bellow average. The sushi is so bad, that i dont recomend trying it, the rice is extremely overcooked and too thick compare to the fish other ingredients and salats are tasteless. I didntbtry any cooked meals or meat, those could be better but japaneese cousine is definitelly a No go. I wont come back!",Akakiko,Review 274 Similarity,0.507092553

Went again last night with my wife and two sons to celebrate my young son's 19th birthday. The food was fantastic. Salads, makis, sashimi, hot dishes and deserts were of very high standard and served the right time. Service was fantastic as also the atmosphere. You can't call it a high class restaurant but that is not the point when you want to enjoy a good time out.

Instead all was dumped on our table within seconds of each other, which made a nonsense of a meal. The impression was of an management attitude 'you order, we bring, we forget you until you want a bill'. If this suits you, this is a decent place. If you want a pleasant, prolonged meal, go somewhere else.",Akakiko,Review 113 Similarity,0.503952631

20,"Poor service mediocre food.We had a reservation for 12 people. Things started off badly as drinks took avery long time arriving. I can understand that it takes some time to make a cocktail but a beer or water shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to arrive.As there were so many of us we split into groups of four, to help the staff and to make ordering easier. When our food arrived it was all jumbled together. All the sashimi ordered was on one platter, orders one group had ordered were given to another. In short a complete mess.Food was very hit and miss. The tuna was frozen, the scallops were great. No consistency.To make amends they offered us free dessert and a discount which we appreciated however we had one final problem. We asked to split the bill into 3 equal portions (to pay by card) but they informed us that you can't split the bill into equal portions but can only split it by paying for specific items.Overall a disappointing night.

This restaurant chain which for me turned out to be a gem in this city, is well established as a better quality restaurant for a considerable amount of years now, but only lacks in a couple of things, the decor, which is between taverna and beach bar, and the long waiting for food preparation (if ordering warm food).

30,"I have been to Akakiko several times but my last time proves that you cannot count on this place to be reliably good. I am all for giving a place second and third chances but the haphazardness of the quality of service must be noted as it ranges from excellent to very bad and everything in between. The food is good, nothing stellar but decent if you do not have many expectations for a sushi place in a taste and experience- wise super-conservative country. The prices are ok -- we paid 25 euros per person (group of 4) for a shared starter plate, main dish and one bottle of wine. It is not great but everything is overpriced in Cyprus so I am noting this in context. The location is also good as it is very central and there is plenty of parking. The outside part is also nice in the summer-- it is cosy and the feeling of being on top of a building adds atmosphere-- although it could seriously use some fans on a hot and humid night, which are the majority of summer nights in Nicosia. Where this place seriously lacks is the quality of service. The staff is nice but, even if one excuses their not knowing Greek, it is hard to excuse their lack of knoweldge about the dishes. They were willing to find out of course but we got the feeling that they just did not want to be there and we simply created trouble for them. We had to ask for water several times, they kept forgetting to bring it. and the extra ginger we ordered never came. Then, while waiting for someone to come and ask us about coffee and dessert, we simply got the bill (!) even though we did not ask for it! This really cut our night out short.",Akakiko,Review 329 Similarity,0.441054277

50,"I do not understand why this restaurant is not listed in the absolute top of the Nicosia restaurant scene. I live in London and love my sushi and am convinced this restaurant can compete AND outperform many of the restaurants back home and sushi restaurants I have visited in Miami and NYC. Let me tell you whyâ€¦.In a nutshell: It is creative, delicious and delivers consistent quality on whatever you order! A rare combination if you ask me.Normally you might have your favorites if you order different maki rolls but what surprised me was that even though we tried many different dishes on the menu â€¦ all of them tasted as a minimum ""good"" and most of them were super tasty! The chefs are clearly trying to push the boundaries. Yes; you can go with the 'safe' options but i really encourage you to be a bit more daring â€¦.. go off the beaten path and order something different. You will not be disappointed! Who could ever imagine that a Mango-maki or deep fired crab stick and smoked aubergine maki (yum!) could taste so delicious :). Or the Black Rain. It is all delicious, freshly prepared and portion-sizes are generous.And you know what the best thing is? I've only spoken about the sushi part. Where i think this restaurant really excels is on the hot plates. Especially the hot starters taste amazing! Pop Corn Shrimp, Peking Duck spring rolls or the Pork Buns .. all were yummy! We were so happy we were with a big group so we could try them all.In summary: Akakiko clearly tries to make you taste something different, something new! And whereas some places go over the top and create dishes that are not well balanced, here the balance is totally right. You wait in anticipation what the next dish will deliver. And you get to enjoy a nice setting where service is professional and friendly. So if you feel like sushi; don't miss out and find your way over!",Akakiko,Review 275 Similarity,0.40824829

There was some delay bringing the main course but acceptable considering the restaurant was crowded.Our starters were tasty, the best spring roll I've ever had filled with duck served with sauce and 2 pices of sushi. Our main courses were Seafood In Miso Teppan and Sesame Chicken. The first one was very tasty and well cooked , we didn't really like the Chicken as it was not crunchy outside and soft inside as I had expected, nor the sauce of it was something special. Presentation was nice for both dishes, accompanied with nice fresh salad and steam rice. We also had some noodles with vegetables, tasty but a lot of carrots in there as a proportion to the rest veggies.Prices were good costing us some 45 euros for 2 persons with a small sake and a soft drink.

They offer lunch deals, but they are not as appealing as I'd hoped. I'd have preferred better deals on sushi, which I didn't feel they offered. The service was painfully slow.

10,"Wow, an award of excellence. They must be going cheap these days. I visited Akakiko for my birthday with a group of friends based on the recent huge advertising campaign for this place and other oriental restaurants being fully booked. When we arrived we had to actively encourage the service to find our reservation as they stood at the till talking, or just kept walking past us. Once seated we again had to ask for the menus after sitting there for roughly 20 minutes. When the food arrived, the starter platter of sushi was plentiful but I experienced something that I had never before seen (or smelled) anywhere. I don't eat sushi myself but my circle does, and it has never stunk before and I don't think that is normal. For myself I ordered various dumplings, one of which was supposed to be lobster. Either they were the blandest lobster I ever had (and I'm big on the lob) or they were a faux-lobster made of blended crab sticks with prawns. When the mains arrived most seemed to be quite bland and were not adequately hot (as in temperature, not spice). My plate of beef with broccoli was served in the water run-off of the meat and the broccoli was a foul frozen and boiled mess which retained the broth in the head and tasted like.. well I'll just say disgusting. Any beef was rump or a poor selection of tough meat and not suitable for stir fry. It was supposed to be a wok stir fry which I can make in two minutes at home for 5 euros with fresh ingredients, rather than a horrible mess of cold, yet melting vegetables and sparse and tough meat. The white wine we ordered was warm, the staff did not serve it, and at the end of the night, we practically had to beg for the check from the two girls, yet again, gossiping at the till. The best part of the evening was my cake, which we brought from a fantastic local bakery. Oh, and people were allowed to smoke indoors, which is against the law but the management clearly does not care. Avoid like rotting fish.",Akakiko,Review 298 Similarity,0.377964473

40,"I tried this restaurant at the insistence of my wife who, having spent several weeks in Japan, is much more familiar with what constitutes a decent sushi restaurant than I. this was my first sushi experience and I was not disappointed . Even though it was Friday night prime eating time and we hadn't booked, we were still given the option to eat at the bar - which we did. The menu was given to us within 60 seconds and it is enormous. Obviously the sushi and sashimi contribute to much of the menu but there are so many more choices, mainly Asian Fusion, for those who do not like the idea of eating raw fish and before last night I would've been one of those people . The food was fresh and bursting with flavour and arrived at our table very quickly. If you are new to sushi and want to try it for the first time, this is a good place to start . It does feel a little 'franchised' but who cares, it's good food at a good price. 2 starters and a sushi platter for 2 plus â‚¬18 bottle wine = â‚¬60. We couldn't quite manage all of it.

40,"I wrote a post on my blog specifically about our consecutive two-day lunch at Akakiko in Cyprus, which you can view from the link below (with photos):http://hometownbetty.com/more-celebrations-at-akakiko-restaurant-in-cyprus/---------We had to back-to-back lunches on two consecutive outings at Akakiko Restaurant in Cyprus.First Lunch DateThe first lunch date was with a couple of friends who recommended Akakiko. We dined without the kids, which was our first double date in Cyprus! (I think Prof and I should do these more often.)Our friend told us that a Korean who lives in Austria owns the Akakiko restaurant franchise, but someone in Cyprus brought the franchise here. Our friends are frequent patrons of this place, and we were treated like kings and queens at lunch.They offered several things on the house. It first began with jasmine and green tea served in clear teapots and teacups. The hot tea was a flavorful blend, which reminded me of my college years when I could fully appreciate tea drinking.The server brought another dish on the house â€“ four bowls of miso soup. The miso soup had seaweed, sliced green onions, and tiny cubes of tofu mixed together. Knowing how much our kids enjoy miso soup, they would have devoured all four bowls if they were at lunch with us.We each ordered a plethora of bento boxes and hot dishes that satisfied our appetites.(Photos Above: Bento box with Bulgogi, Hot and spicy chicken (with go-chu-jang sauce), and Chicken with sesame seeds. Can you see Korean-themed elements in Akakikoâ€™s food?)And when things couldnâ€™t get any better, I received a dessert we split in celebration of my birthday.Second Lunch DateThen the following day, we made plans to eat lunch with another family from Piano Manâ€™s school. Our friend suggested Akakiko for lunch, not knowing that we had already eaten there. Because Piano Man wished to dine at Akakiko, it was a natural fit to eat there for a second day in a row.Our friend ordered several amazing dishes and a huge sushi/sashimi/cali roll boat platter. There was enough food to feed the masses, so we ate until we could not eat another bite.Our friendâ€™s hubby made it out to lunch for a quick bite from a busy day at the office, and we thoroughly enjoyed spending more time with them. They truly know how to enjoy life to the fullest. We talked about Indian, Korean and American culture, food, and everything in between. While I would have to say we ate more hot foods on our first visit, the second visit was about eating colder dishes like sushi and sashimi.I donâ€™t eat sushi or sashimi, since I like my food cooked until itâ€™s burned to a crisp, but our friend encouraged me to try it. It turned out to be pretty good, not too fishy or gooey as I would have imagined, but I think I still prefer my food cooked through.Our RecommendationAkakikoâ€™s menu is filled with pages and pages of dishes. You could eat a different dish every night of the week and say youâ€™ve never tried every dish on the menu. I wouldnâ€™t recommend trying every dish on the menu because your waistline (and mine) would expand as far east and west of this side of the Mediterranean.I am pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant where you can eat some Korean food in Cyprus. We thought we would only be eating Korean food at home. And remember earlier when I mentioned that our friend said a Korean started the Akakiko franchise in Austria? If you know anything about how many of the Japanese restaurants are run in the U.S., you know or will find out that many of those Japanese restaurants are owned and run by Koreans. So it wasnâ€™t all that surprising to know that Akakiko has many Korean flavors aded to their dishes. Just a little food for thought.By the way, after reading some reviews on Tripadvisor, there are mixed reviews about Akakiko. Some say the sushi/sashimi is frozen, which Prof said was true. Others have also said they ordered sushi for delivery, which turned out to be a horrible experience for them, but that just sounds like a bad idea to me. I donâ€™t think any restaurant would be willing to give substantial proportions for take-out or delivery when they much rather you dine-in, at least thatâ€™s been our experience at some Japanese restaurants in the States. However, if youâ€™re in Cyprus and have a hankering for Japanese food with a little Korean influence, then Akakiko is the place for you. Just remember to dine-in at Akakiko.We wished we had known about this place sooner in our journey in Cyprus. Wagamama is still a favorite in our household, but we have now added a new favorite Asian restaurant to our mix. Check out other excellent Asian restaurants in Cyprus on the Food Page on the The Seoul of Cyprus, if you get a chance, to make your choice for favorite Asian restaurants in Cyprus!",Akakiko,Review 311 Similarity,0.3313645

Verdict: I am not going back, until I hear from people that quality improves. There's no reason to drive all the way to that area.

It looked like something knocked up by a student in a frying pan.

The tom yum soup was missing the correct ingredient but still served without comment. When I asked why it contained no lemongrass I was told they didn't have any. The sushi was nice though. The wine waiter kept spilling the wine all over the table.,Akakiko,Review 229 Similarity,0
50,"I like the atmosphere of the new Akakiko (after it moved to its new location at Hilton Park hotel). It is very nice especially for couples (even though it can be a bit crowded sometimes).This is my place of choice for sushi as it serves consistently high quality, fresh and tasty dishes.It is a bit pricey but reasonable for a fine dining place. Parking is usually easy in the hotel's lot.",Akakiko,Review 232 Similarity,0

50,"The atmosphere is vibrant, modern and relaxes you, I really liked the lighting. Huge selection of japanese cuisine. The stuff is willing to assist. Do try a glass of plum wine, it really completes the whole experience. You ll need to visit again to try even more tastes. Do visit.",Akakiko,Review 256 Similarity,0
50,"Ignore any negative reviews and give it a go. We have been 4 times so far in our two week holiday and love it.It's fresh and cooked in front of you. Obviously with most of the dishes being fried a bit of oil is used (responding to ""greasy"" comments below) but it's really tasty.Would say it's more Asian fusion that specifically Japanese but give it a go if you are not after a long sit down meal",Akakiko,Review 264 Similarity,0
40,"everything is nice, big variety, even bentos out for takeaways..only issue: they use wrong soya sause for sushi and sashimi... really, with that nice and costly place, they should really import the right soya sause from japan (yes, there is a special soya sause for it... noone in cyprus has it usually, and its a pitty as it makes a lot of difference once you tried it once - and i had the luck of doing so in my trips to japan)",Akakiko,Review 319 Similarity,0
30,"We visit Akakiko very offten coz we love sushi but last time we went was a total dissappointment and will be our last. We went early, ordered a starter, all great. The main dish, although the prices havent changed, was poor and the quantity was allot less.The thing that really pissed me off was when we gave the money to pay the bill, we were waiting 45 mins for the waiterss to return â‚¬0.80 as change.We even asked her twice for the change and it still took them 45 mins to bring the change!!Will never ever go there again!!",Akakiko,Review 321 Similarity,0
