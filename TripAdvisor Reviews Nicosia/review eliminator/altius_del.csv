I especially appreciated the friendly attitude of the staff which was always ready to satisfy any request. I had to work on a paper late at night and they immediately provided me with the manager's desk (!) in a quiet room where I could work and print for as long as I wanted!

30,A comfortable hotel with generous sized bedroom. It is an easy 20 minute walk to the old town where there are many shops and restaurants to cater for all tastes. The car park is small but there is plenty of on-road parking.The buffet style breakfast was comprehensive with good service.

30,"Staff 5/5 - Friendly and very accommodating. Speak fluent English like most people in Cyprus.Bed 4/5 - soft and comfortable. Pillows are on the thin and hard side.Room 2/5 - spacious enough, no mini-bar to store stuff, clean, but not luxurious. There was a nail coming out of a bathroom tile - a potential danger. Poor noise isolation so you can hear neighbours. That said, they weren't a bother and I slept well, but it's potentially a problem. Despite booking.com stating I'd have a double bed, I ended up with a single bed, though it was big enough.Shower 3/5. Bathtub + shower (I prefer cabins). Weak water pressure, but plenty of hot water.Internet 2/5 - fast when it works, but drops every few minutes - very frustrating to use. If you rely on it, this is a potential deal-breaker.Food 3/5 - breakfast was simple but nice with good coffee. Very limited menu for evening food, but ordering out is easy.Location 4/5 - quite central, but city centre and old town are just out of walking distance. There's nothing within the immediate vicinity however. The area is quiet, and there's a mini-market right next door. Bus stop is close and taxis are affordable. Speak with hotel before arrival if you want help with airport transport - there's a cheap minibus which will take you there directly.Overall impressions:If you can get a good price, I'd recommend the place. I'd say it would be better value if they fixed the bathroom nail, water pressure and Internet (which should have been done as these aren't expensive investments). It would be a great place worth if they sorted the noise isolation, though that would be quite costly so I can't see that happening.It's far from perfect, but I had a pleasant stay and would stay again for the right price.

As a customer, I wittnesed the supervisor-recepionist-""welcome girl"" making serious and extended warnings to a waitress because she did not use a kind of paper for its proper use, or something like that. The majority of the stuff showed professionalism and warmth! Even though it fascilitates mostly bussiness trips, the WiFi is unacceptable, not even for Social media use. The food was really boring and the ingredients were of low quality. Avoid having lunch or dinner there because it is sure that you will taste food wine and beer bought from the cheapest German super market of the area!

50,"I was quite satisfied with the quality of the rooms; the lobby decor, the breakfast (usually included), cleanliness, and the location (few minutes ride to center of city or about 20-25 minutes on foot). I especially was impressed with the staff; who not only made every effort to make me comfortable they were also pleasant (and spoke English very well - tolerating my broken Greek too boot).",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 90 Similarity,0,Review 147 Similarity,0.210818511

The staff was extremely polite and dedicated.

Only negative comment is TV has Cypriot channels only. I hope they introduce IPTV. F&B is fine although breakfast could be better in terms of choice. The staff are 100% and in particular the wonderful Elle - the assistant manager. Yes i would visit again.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 28 Similarity,0.188982237,Review 83 Similarity,0.195180015

30,"I was staying in Altius in May for busines and the only word, which comes to my mind is ""basic"". Air conditioning in the room wasn't working properly and there was a persistent smell of sewage in the lobby. You can walk to the city centre but this is a 25-30 min walk, which is not a nice walk. The nearest cash point is half way though this walk. All in all, you can stay here if you are after an inexpensive stay. Mind you the hotel is sandwiched between two busy roads and it can be quite noisy. On a positive side, the staff were very friednly, Altius offers a good breakfast and there is a decent bar. WiFi was poor",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 23 Similarity,0.441941738,Review 10 Similarity,0.182574186

40,"I accompanied a group of 20 college students for a study-abroad class, and we had a great experience staying at the altius. The location was convenient and the staff was very helpful. They called cabs for us frequently. They let us store a large equipment case at the front desk and gave us access to it whenever we needed it. The waiter in the breakfast room knew my morning coffee order by the second day and brought it before I even asked. The rooms were serviced regularly and well.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 54 Similarity,0.353553391,Review 34 Similarity,0.182574186
20,"I have been hosted in a room dedicated for disabled people, without me knowing it ahead of time. When I asked from the reception to change they told me that there is no other room available, it was already 21:00 o clock. Once I had a shower it was not possible to enter to the bath room again, (see picture) unless I take into consideration that I had to get wet shoes and underwear! There is an instant coffee maker (water heater), no sugar, no spoon. The room is at the first floor that is very noisy from the street that is in front of the hotel. There is a nice family feast aura to just across the street, that makes life easier for lunch or dinner. Breakfast I will comment once I get the experience.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 12 Similarity,0.447213595,Review 8 Similarity,0.173205081

30,"The people at the Altius are agreeable, helpful and eager to please. The bedrooms are dated and tired. Two examples. 1. Our bathroom had no grab handle or support when getting into/out of the bath/shower (perilous for those with stiff backs) and the floor, while clean, showed wear and tear. 2. The desk has no power points: the nearest one was used by room's standing lamp - at least 3 power points by the desk are needed (more are desirable).",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 8 Similarity,0.5,Review 2 Similarity,0.129099445

30,Definitely a bit off the beaten path. Other reviews mentioned air conditioning problems and I too experienced them - room was very stuffy - when a/c did work it did bring a bit of relief. The staff is great and does their best to make your stay pleasant. Traffic noise was evident even on the 4th floor. There are a few restaurants and cafes in few minutes walking distance.

Room was stuffy, and opening the balcony door was not an option due to noise outside. Service is shocking, it took almost 45 min to book us in when we arrived, we were on a tight schedule because of a race we had entered. We were looking forward to have a couple of drinks in the bar, which was only 1 in the end. The lady managing the bar told us the receptionist could keep serving us, because her shift was finished. That was not the case. We are extremely unhappy with the overall stay in the Altius, and value for money is not compatible.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 35 Similarity,1,Review 1 Similarity,0
