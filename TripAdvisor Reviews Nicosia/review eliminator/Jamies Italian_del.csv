The interieur is a mix of modern Italian and the classical style of Jamie Oliver's restaurants in London. The food was great. I tried the bolognese pasta and the truffle risotto. Especially the risotto was perfect and could not be better. Coupled with the very nice and friendly staff, the restaurant is a great place to spend time for lunch or dinner.

The kids didn't like their lollipop chicken as it was slightly over cooked and a bit dry but they liked my burger and chips as well as the yogurt dip that came with their dish.Not as overpriced as some reviews claim, not cheap but not so dear either.

Pasta with meat balls was horrible, crab spaghetti was literally crab and my little sons salmon was a bowl of red sauce with a bit of salmon swimming somewhere in there! I ate pumpkin ravioli which was average. For desert my youngest son ordered brownie with ice cream which looked amazing in the picture but when it actually arrived he said, mummy this is so small and different compared to the picture.

I am a big fan of Jamie's and like his cooking style, so was excited to try the restaurant. We arrived and were greeted, escorted to our table and ordered within 5 min. Nice so far. Between my two visits we tried the Italian steak, ribeye, pork chop, burger, and the rigatoni. Both visits it took the kitchen about 35-40 min to prepare, and both were on quiet days. Both times we were on a lunch break and in a hurry to get back, and ended being late.

I love Italian cooking and while I'm certainly no expert, there was nothing I tried that makes me want to go back again. In contrast, Chef Giorgio Locatelli's delicate chicken-filled ravioli served with a cheese fondue and topped with radicchio WILL make me go back to his restaurant again.What was terrible: the desserts. I tried the Tiramisu and gave up after a couple of spoons. It felt like somebody had poured in a sack of sugar. The others at the table had trouble with their desserts too.

I believe that if the chef had chosen to add a type of goat cheese it would have done wonders.Now the main was also an extreme. My partner's chiken with egg was so good I just wanted to switch plates with him. It was so velvety and tasty to the palate. My crab spaghetti on the other half was tasteless.

The other starter, a chill prawn dish, was so small that the whole thing hardly amounted to a mouthful. The spaghetti with crab was small, not very tasty and contained very little crab. My husband's steak was chewy and sinewy and our friend's crispy squid was not crispy. The only redeeming feature was the desserts. The cost was not cheap.

At the first instance, what my friend and I said is that the outside area was too noisy. We could hardly hear each other. The waiter came and politely gave us the menus while announcing tonight's special. What I had noticed from the menu is that the selection of items is small but adequate to satisfy most tastes. I chose the spaghetti nero (black) with seafood and in fact pointed to the food with my finger when the waiter was taking the order. My friend had the burger which she requested well done but the waiter said it only come in one way (the chef's way apparently). When the food came some time later I noticed that my spaghetti was white, not black. I called the waiter back to say that I had ordered something else and his response was 'I repeated the order to you'. Indeed, he had but it was so noisy I could not hear him and never actually said that the order was fine (my friend had, I just commented that I had no idea what he said due to the noisy background). I then politely asked if I can send the wrong order back and he said the kitchen is too busy right now! So I asked him, what am I forcibly having then? He replied fresh crab spaghetti. I like crab so I said ok although I was disappointed as I really wanted the black seafood pasta. From the first bite I could tell the pasta was too dry, it was so dry it stuck together! I presume they must have cooked it in advance and it got stuck. Overall, I was far from impressed, could have cooked better pasta at home. Then when the bill came I noticed the crab pasta was more expensive that the one I had ordered (and pointed!). Not only did the waiter bring the wrong plate without apologizing, he didn't even offer us dessert (as compensation) or at least allow me to pay the price for the food I had initially ordered! I'll never be visiting this restaurant again, the food is not that good and the prices too high, the ambience is ruined by the noisy background and the waiters are obviously untrained!

Up to this point the food was very good. Then the main courses came and the things went pretty bad. The steak was cooked very well done, while the waiters advertised the steak to be cooked at 70 degrees and told us we should expect it to be served medium rear. When I complained they apologised but at the end they charged it at my bill. I had to ask them to take it out of the bill since it wasnt served as it should and we didnt eat it. They did but the excuse wasnt convincing by one of the waiters: ""the steak cannot be served every time the same... sometimes it can be medium and sometimes well done, depending on how thick the steak is cut..."" Whatttt???? Oh my God. Anyway... They should just say sorry. The chicken was very oily, more than it should... The deserts were very good. My favourite desert was the lemon cheesecake. Amazing. The cost was quite high too. I paid 86 euros for two persons with a glass of wine and without charging me the steak. Conclusion: With my experience i would say the kitchen needs some time to adjust.

30,"Having the privilege to live and study in the UK for almost 6 years, i was daily 'slammed into' the world of the most beloved British chef; Jamie Oliver. Seriously he was in abundance like baked beans. Literally though he was everywhere and he kind of passed his ideology on food to most British i knew. Don't get me wrong on this ok, i often catched my self watching him on youtube for hours. But enough with the intro lets get down to his 'temple' of Italian cuisine. First of all Jamie's Italian as a franchise does really well both in the UK and in Europe. However here in Cyprus it was well adapted in our culture and for me it lacks this Italian finesse; not in the atmosphere, which i rate it 5 out of 5, but in the food. I know as Cypriots we are a demanding sort of people. But hey, this is after-all an ITALIAN restaurant. Get rid of the steaks and burgers and the chicken fillets. Go on with some crazy panzerotti, or calzone, more pizzas or even crack on with some stews (which are not authentic Italian recipes but they can better serve you than a burger); and to be honest if i wanted a burger i wouldn't bother coming to Jamie's Italian. In any case, service is quite moderat but quite smiley hostesses make your way to the huge and awesome dining area and make you feel warm, as it should be. Speaking of budget, dishes are a bit overpriced, especially when it comes to antipasti. Come on its a salad, a tasty salad, but still a salad. Same goes for pasta which is tasty as well, impressed by mezzaluna, but a bit overpriced. Finally i would like to give my best credit to the subtle detail given to children's food which is rather impressive and i respect that.Overall, a moderate dining experience for the name of one of the most infamous chefs worldwide.",Jamies Italian,Review 101 Similarity,0.263523138,Review 209 Similarity,0.260377822

While the interior design was lovely and the food was fine, the overall experience was disappointing.The initial vibe of the restaurant was more TGI Fridays than sophisticated and classy. There were many large families with loud and disruptive children, their squeals echoing around the hard floors and artisan interior design.Our experience was not helped by the fact we were located on a small table in the middle of the walkway of the restaurant next to the bar. This meant that we had a constant stream of people walking by us and putting their butts in our faces and dinners (including the staff). There were other tables in more quiet and relaxed positions but alas we were not so fortunate to get seated there.I did really love their artisan bread box and glad to see the excellent local Zambartas wines on the menu. Our mains were perfectly fine but certainly nothing to rave about. The service was average too, serving our dinner within about 2 minutes of ordering it so our whole dinner experience finished in about 1 hour.When our mains were served we were keen to get drinks to accompany them. By the time we managed to get the attention of our waiter, order drinks and have them delivered we had finished our dinner. They then asked us for coffee. Not sure I know of anyone who enjoys their coffee with a cold glass of white wine.Keeping in mind this is a local restaurant for us, would we go back?!

It said that it's served with salad and grilled vegetables but it was some greens without sauce and 3 tiny pieces of grilled vegetables! The pasta and burger wasn't something special also.

Thirdly, the child's meal (salmon in a bag) had 4 thin slivers of salmon, and was definitely not filling. The portions of the meals in general are very small considering the prices. The only saving grace was the attitude of the staff, they are beyond pleasant and accommodating. As far as going again, probably, if only to see if we have a different experience. I will say that they were incredibly busy and so mistakes can be made. But portion sizes, especially for the pasta must be reconsidered.

But this is not the case during the week when it's a more professional group, or later in the evening.The restaurant also has a nice patio where one can eat or just have cocktails and appetizers.So this isn't a quaint taverna tucked away in a corner of the old town, and it's an admittedly commercial decor, but when I get tired of the usual fare, Jamie's satisifies my need for a more diverse, international menu with plenty of taste sensations available -- in several visits I've never been disappointed.",Jamies Italian,Review 225 Similarity,0.456435465,Review 45 Similarity,0.125

The service brings in mind a high-end American restaurant and the decoration has a British finesse. Admittedly the portions of the dishes are a bit small for the Cypriot stomach however the restaurant is constantly making changes to match the local expectations.Overall if you expect to find eccentric dishes garnished with gold and what not, then you are at the wrong establishment.

Alas when seated we noticed that there was a speaker above us blaring out Country and western music (well that is what it sounded like to me) . I had to ask twice to have the music turned down. Maybe I am fickle but I would expect Italian music in an Italian restaurant. There's wonderful pop and folk music produced there just as I would expect Indian music in an Indian restaurant..The food generally was OK. i ordered Chicken Milanese. I didn't have a clue what I was ordering and unlike the others who went for the steak(they said it was OK) I chose something at random. I'd describe it as cardboard dipped in flour, egg and crumbs. Maybe it was overcooked or was cooked twice. Even I can make a better chicken schnitzel. I was forced to break the fried egg and spread it to make it palatable. The green salad had no dressing. The other chicken dish was average. I am use to going to a wonderful Italian restaurant in New Zealand where Jamie is hoping to open a restaurant in Wellington. La Strada has recently closed in Whanganui. The proprietor had to sell it for health reasons. A pity as it set the standard by which I judge other Italian restaurants by now. I must say that the tattooed young lady who served us was a wonderful host. I still think that restaurants should have quiet spaces in them where conversations can happen. With modern computer technology that is possible. Usually I would say something to the manager if served a mediocre meal.

From the trendy, immaculate atmosphere to the friendly, attentive staff, Jamie’s Italian has cemented itself in our list of favourites! The décor and ambiance is rustically Italian, with a modern twist – don’t expect to find the traditional hues of primary red, green and white; the restaurant has adopted its own unique flair that successfully fast-forwards the establishment to a contemporary, yet authentic eatery.Jamie’s Italian offers a great choice of food and certainly caters according to one’s budget. One has the option of selecting scrumptious meals from the lunchtime special (2 courses for €13.95 or three courses for €15.95), or the more diverse selection of Italian meals available à la carte. The latter proved slightly expensive for Cyprus standards, but it certainly beats the commercialized meals offered at any other renowned chain restaurant. All meals were well-presented, portions were adequate and more importantly, served in a timely manner. Highly recommended is the Black Angus steak, chargrilled with truffle butter, shaved truffle, balsamic onions, drizzled in a creamy wild mushroom sauce. Our flavorsome Italian gastronomical journey was complemented by a soiree of appetizing deserts that leave one wishing to return for more.

Thoroughly enjoyed the Caesar salad made with fresh greens and radicchio and especially the healthy, tasty yoghurt dressing and toasted hazelnuts.I also thoroughly enjoyed my tagliatelle bolognese beautifully al dente and innovatively topped with pangrattato! Kept stealing from my hubby's gorgeous fries (as he had the burger, which was also yum).The tiramisu was excellent. Really liked the shaved chocolate grated on top and the subtle taste of orange.Will be back to taste the seafood with black squid ink and the lava cake!",Jamies Italian,Review 135 Similarity,0.288675135,Review 185 Similarity,0

30,"I love Jamie's Italian restaurants - they are probably my favourite in UK - especially the one in Bath and in Kingston.Sadly Nicosia Jamie's is not up to scratch, at least not yet. It only opened last week and I assume things can only get better. The restaurant in my opinion is not in a great location and took us a long time to drive through all the traffic lights from Debenhams (about 30 minutes) and this was at a quiet time of the day. However, interior of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful, a lot of money has been spent on its appearance.I had the meatballs which did not remotely compare with those in UK - these were made from pork and were dry and tasteless. We had to ask for parmesan.Good to see both Italian and Cypriot wine on the menu although it is overpriced - a rather mediocre white at Euro 6.5 per 175 ml glass is more than we normally pay in decent restaurants in Cyprus.Staff were pleasant but some looked rather confused; training is still in evidence.Hopefully things will improve and we will give it a few months before visiting again.",Jamies Italian,Review 378 Similarity,0.273861279,Review 203 Similarity,0

Free glasses of Prosecco, Free birthday cake afterwards plus a birthday present! We splashed out and both had the most expensive steak on the menu. And whilst waiting we were given their special bread and dip to keep us going, again at no charge! Was the steak worth waiting for, yes, yes, yes, yes! It was fabulous, mine was rare to medium and my beloved's was medium to well done, we requested plain chips and the steaks came with mushrooms and button onions. We had a friend with us who had carbonara and the most amazing salad, which he shared. I had a non-alcoholic cocktail and we had a bottle of water. I left there walking on cloud 9, the staff were superb, they are so very special, just a mention though for Christina who is such a jewel in that restaurant's crown. At the end after the main meals, the bread and the delicious birthday cake we waddled out of there and it still only cost us about 30+ euros each. This is definitely our 'go-to' restaurant when we have the inclination - or should I say when I don't want to cook.

30,Today 5/12 was my mum's birthday.She made it to 90.So I decided to give her a treat thinking that Jamie's Italian in Nicosia might be a good choice.That was about the dumbest decision I ever made because the evening was a disaster as a result of the staff's incompetence and their inability to offer restitution.But let's start the whole sad story in chronological order.Three days before the event I went personally to the restaurant to pick a table.I was well received by a pleasant girl at reception and was offered the table I requested.I was quite pleased with myself but quite oblivious of the tsunami of blunders that were to occur on what was to be a special evening for mum on her 90th birthday. Cocktails arrived a little late but they were invigorating and tasty.As we were preparing to savour the vegetable antipasti platter we had ordered a young waiter arrived fast and furious bearing the main course of one fillet steak and Gennaro's chicken.We asked about our antipasti only to be told that there was a cock up in the kitchen. He then made the absurd suggestion to bring the antipasti later.We cancelled the veggies and concentrated on the maim course .Mother was struggling with her 30 Euro steak when I realised that a steak knife was not issued. We asked for one and the knife arrived promptly.But our torture was to continue.I soon became aware that the ''funky'' chips I had ordered were not so funky because they looked like roast potatoes.They got that one wrong as well. In a while they brought some soft and oily chips in an odd-looking container. I concluded they were the funky ones .I ate one or two and went back to the roast potatoes thinking that they were the better deal.We desperately tried to save the evening by ordering two glasses of wine.But they were nowhere to be seen.We were half way through our dish and no alcohol in sight to comfort us.The wine finally arrived following our protestations. All of a sudden a young man approached us and tried to offer what appeared to be an apology by waffling and saying nothing substantial.I gave him a piece of my mind but he continued quite undaunted by my negative commentary of the restaurant.I could not but smile in the end and that encouraged him to come up wit this priceless gem. .''Sir when you leave this restaurant i would like you to wear your best smile''. I could not believe my ears and responded with a vengeance.''The only thing that would make me smile would be if you step on top of our table and performed an oriental dance.''What a memorable evening!,Jamies Italian,Review 111 Similarity,0.226455407,Review 240 Similarity,0
