Unfortunately, you are not allowed to take pictures in the museum, which is a real shame. Sometimes you feel that the information given in the leaflet is not enough (or there's no translation into any language from Greek) but the staff are so happy to answer all the questions you might get that it's an absolute must to engage in a conversation with them and you will find out a lot of interesting information.",Cyprus Folk Art Museum

Includes clothes, furniture, musical instruments, photographs and much more.

Good little shop at entrance and shaded tables outside for trying some Cypriot drinks and snacks. Close to other museums.",Cyprus Folk Art Museum

I liked it and surely recommend it, for those who are interested to have history knowledges about this small but interesting country.",Cyprus Folk Art Museum
40,"The Folk Art Museum is situated within the Archibishop's building. I was not interested at the beginning to visit it but I decided to visit it and I was not dissapointed. It was a very interesting experience. The building was made out of stone and archs and it was really nice to be there. It includes 5-6 small rooms that cover what you expect from a folk art museum. We were really satisfied at the end and we overall enjoyed it. There was also a guide but unfortunately let's say that she was not an expert of the exhibitions.I do not recommend to go to this area only for this museum, but if you are nearby, definitely it is a very good choice and you can estimate your visit at about 20-30 minutes. Outside the museum was a lady with traditional products and inside a small shop.",Cyprus Folk Art Museum

Interesting architecture, lovely, intetesting exhibitions.I went there on 18th of May and they had plenty of events to participate.I tasted a local sweet and I made my own pottery.

50,"My visit at the Folk Art Museum in Nicosia was an interesting experience! The museum is an old building itself so it was really interesting to be there. The artefacts of the museum give you a vivid image about the traditional life in Cyprus. It is really fantastic to observe the difference in lifestyles then and now. I had also the opportunity to buy a couple of ""traditional"" objects-souvenirs from the museum's shop. It is a place that people should visit!!",Cyprus Folk Art Museum
50,A great little museum next to the Archbishops palace. Ask for a guided tour from the very informative staff and you'll have a much better visit.,Cyprus Folk Art Museum
50,"The building itself is originally 15th century gothic with latter additions.It was originally used as a monastery for the Latin Order of Benedictines and was taken over by the Greek Orthodox Church sometime before the Ottoman occupation in 1571. It went on to become the Archibishopâ€™s Palace prior to the building of the new Archbishopric nearby.The door is carved stone archway with a 16th century fresco of the Annunciation, and it is supposed to be the oldest fresco of the city.Exhibits:What the visitor sees here is a vast collection of everyday items from a forgotten era. The collection is rich and it is split in different rooms. This is where you will find the costumes of the people; the looms used to weave their fabrics; pottery; furniture â€“often beautifully carved and painted in bright colours; decorative baskets that were used for different things; Jewellery and other metal work including the most intricate filigree work. There are samples of embroidery as well.A stroll out here makes the guest feel as if he enters a time-machine that takes him back to Nicosia, a century and a half back. You see, 150 years back the people of Cyprus were still under the yoke of Ottoman rule and the majority of them were extremely poor. A completely different picture of what is today.I highly recommend it. Be sure not to miss it!Fee is 2 euros for adults,1 for children, and special discounts for groups.Opening Hours:Monday to Friday- 09:00 to 16:00Saturday: 09:00 to 13:00Tel: +357 2243 2578",Cyprus Folk Art Museum

30,"It a really small museum, which was founded by a few members of the society of Cypriot Studies in 1937. It was nice to see how people used to live in Cyprus, but we finished the whole museum within 20 minutes. We paid for this 20 minutes 2â‚¬, which was quite a lot, taking into consideration that there was no air condition and no toilets either. But it was cosy and with atmosphere, maybe they will improve their facilities in the future, because they opened the museum some time ago.",Cyprus Folk Art Museum
