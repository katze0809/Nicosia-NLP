The dishes are unadulterated, they are cooked willingly, the service will be good, candles, hearts and good music for a better mood. Your special occasion or day can be even more unique if you are welcomed at domus.Everyone will be sure your holiday is unforgettable.

50,"I agree with what people write about Domus. It was my first visit to the restaurant last month and I was impressed.Decor is beautiful and different from any other restaurant. I expected it to be crowded although a week day but it was not. Just very few tables. Lighting is very poor and this would be one thing to maybe find negative.Way too dark. I understand it adds to the atmosphere but it is way overdone. Food was excellent! We had sea bass and chicken al pesto which were super tasty in good portions! Timing was perfect! Dessert was delicious (we had the lava cake with ice cream). Portion is very big and surprisingly much bigger than other places I had this. Maybe dessert itself it was not 10 out of 10 but nearly there (I would give 8 to 9 which makes it almost excellent). I found that food in Domus beats the desserts at least for my opinion. I will agree that prices tend to be on the upper scale especially if you have a bottle of wine but worths it! It's a place for these different, special occasions! Don't miss it! Surely returning.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 121 Similarity,0.5

30,"Domus has managed to stay afloat for a long time so it's possible that our first visit there in nearly 8 years was perhaps a fluke. The food was certainly not bad, however since we had attempted to make reservations a few previous times we expected much more. The service is good, the place is nice although some of the decor is certainly kitsch. Its worth a visit for a romantic meal for couples.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 154 Similarity,0.492365964
50,"I went to Domus a few of times, some on office outings (holiday parties, leaving-dos, etc.), some on dates others with friends. I was never disappointed, and Domus seemed to cater perfectly for each occasion. The interior feels very cosy and discreet at the same time. Combine that with perfect service and you feel that you're the only table in the restaurant (which is never the case - always book in advance!). In the summertime the outdoor seating is a bit of a aesthetic compromise (compared to the interior), but this is Cyprus after all and seating outside to eat in an old part of the city is still very enjoyable.Impeccable dishes (and we made sure to try all of them on the office functions!) I'm sure the menu changes from time to time but the dishes I remember mostly were the succulent lamb shank (no knife needed it was so soft and creamy!) and the best beef carpaccio I have ever had. The friendly owner is always around, making sure everyone is having a good time. This to me is the sign that this restaurant means something more than just 'running a business'. It is obvious the people at Domus are passionate and happy about what they do. It might be a bit pricey, but that never left a bad taste in mouth after the great experience and good food. Absolutely worth it.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 147 Similarity,0.484200125

40,"DomusArrived in the dark and being a first time visitor I initially thought the restaurant was still completely empty at 2115 when I arrived. Almost considering to leave untill I noticed a couple taking an entrance which I hadnt noticed and they took the stairs up. Only then I found out that the restaurant is 1st floor and the lounge which was empty located on the ground floor.So just in time I also took the stairs up and found the cozy resto upstairs. With quite a number of people eating already. Being alone (I was on business trip) I still love to dine out and a full restaurant I prefer being on my own (although I get the once in while akward looks). But who cares, I dont at least.Then to the description of the evening.The sitting on the high tables with the rather small but high stools is a bit uncomfortable I must say. I noticed more people had issues with the seating. Would definity advise to change the setting for normal standard height tables and chairs. It will add to the comfort. The resto is very nice, dimmed light, good background music, different corners and chambers. Love the glass drops like a chandelier above some if the tables. Complement for the tasteful decorations.The food.The white bread served with olive oil and tapenade was old while the brown bread was crips much better and seemed fresh. Being alone at the table I took house wine by the glass, which was strangely enough not mentioned in the extensive wine list. But it was pointed out nicely by the waitress that they had also wines by the glass. Took a nice local Cypriotic white wine.I started with the Provincale Mussels which was simple and good. Mussels slightly overcooked but the sauce nice and creamy.Main course was served quickly after starter (could have take a bit longer).The Morrocan styled Salmon was cooked perfect exactly how salmon should be to my opinion. I understand the choice of rise (why not couscous) when you call it Morrocan Salom, but it didnt fit me. I ordered it because I was curious about the Morrocan Salmon idea. Killed the curiousity, but I wont order it again.Finished with a After-Eight icecream. Tasteful abd good to finish the meal with (like after-eights). The ice cream could have done with some more (and warm) chocolate poured over it.Bill adding up to ‚Ç¨60 including tipp.All-in-all I liked it. Will I go back? Will I recommend.

My husband had the mushroom risotto which was served scorching hot, it took 10 minutes before my husband could touch it. Once he could eat it, it was tasty.

However, we would prefer it to be a little bit more luminous. The service is typical for this kind of restaurant. Actually, this is a restaurant where you expect the waiter to fill in your glass when you have just drunk a swig. I have to admit that this, most times, makes me feel very uncomfortable, but if you like it, you will not be dissapointed. Regarding the food, we ordered pork fillet and duck with orange, salad and some red wine. Our plates were well cooked, and very well decorated, but I think, not amazing. I would like to clarify that, since this is not an ordinary restaurant, and since it is a bit pricey, the expectations are much higher. The bill was around 60 euros for 2 persons.

40,"The 'Domus' has held its well deserved, I believe, presence in the Nicosia smart society circles for years now. The secret of its success lies in the uncrowded arrangement of the tables giving the impression of private dining experience, the impeccable service, the more than passable food and the presence of the vibrant lounge bar on the ground floor for before or afters.The first floor restaurant is divided into the many smaller rooms of the restored 19th century mansion it is housed in. The d√©cor here is dark, baring plush red velvet similarities to a 19th century Parisian bordello, albeit of an upmarket, elegant and tasteful variety, and highlighted with touches of late 20th century design. The lounge bar on the ground floor is light and airy, avoiding all the glass and minimalist fashionable commonplaces with a clever use of a plank wood motif.Service is impeccable from the moment you arrive until the complementary liqueurs and coffee.The cuisine is a take on european fusion food, including Italian, generic Mediterranean, nouvelle French touches and with many healthy options. If I have a gripe it is that it panders to Cypriot taste rather than attempt to educate it. The table is tastefully set with tall desert glasses standing for bread baskets. After a beautifully presented amuse bouche of salmon mousse on biscuit courtesy of the chef, our starters of rocca salad, salmon carpaccio (needed more acidity/lemon?), stuffed aubergines and the exceptional pate with cherry compote went down well with my guests. The main courses received mixed comments. The rigatoni with salmon in vodka sauce were surprisingly 'al dente' but could have done with much less or the complete absence of cream. The pork fillet stuffed with wild mushrooms was well executed and tender. My friends declared the chicken Dijon to be the best of the mains. For desert we tried the chocolate souffl√© and the healthy option raspberry yoghurt with ice cream.The wine list is short for such a classy restaurant and needs updating.

40,"Having come to Cyprus for past 26 years and married to my Cypriot wife for same length of time I was keen to find a top class restaurant in Nicosia where I could take my wife's family out for a nice evening meal that we are are spoilt for choice in London.Domus certainly looked to tick all the boxes. Beautiful setting in old walled part of town with an enticing romantic setting reminiscent of an old Italian villa. We sat outside on beautifully set tables and sofas with drop down lanterns above our heads that really set the scene for a delightful evening.However whilst the setting and menu looked impressive I do feel that the service needs to try a little harder.Upon arrival it's always nice to be asked if we would like an aperitif before dinner but I had to ask a waiter after 10 minutes for this to arrive.My starter was excellent however my Steak Diane was more then medium/rare more like medium/well done and my mash was luke warm at best.I also asked for a glass of red wine that had obviously come straight out of the fridge! I know in some people class this as a new trend but not in most.One of my party was also served the wrong main course but she then had to wait another 20 minutes for her meal to arrive by which time we had all finished ours.When the meal eventually came there was no offer of an apology for the wait.Having said all that we will try again due to the setting and 70% good food however please just do not rest on ambience and setting alone, it is the food that counts.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 123 Similarity,0.246182982

Food was satisfactory. I didn't pay but I know it was above our usual spendings, and too much for what we had according to my husband jugement.Second time was summer with a friend, who had special thank to give me, so didn't mind about the price. Then I proposed that place.We sat outside and the environment was kind of magic. But...The waiter didn't have a clue about what he was doing, just standing along in a soldier pose. We could hardly grab our bottle, located far away from our table and we finally kept it with us.Food was very nice (we had beef carpaccio, difficult though to make a bad one except if meat is not fresh), but portions were very poor for the price. Although it was qualified as main dish, we both had to order a second portion to satisfy our hunger (and we had starters before).I meet most of the comments left here, nice but ...I would keep it for special occasions only.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 131 Similarity,0.227272727

I loved the atmosphere and I loved my salad starter but I have to say the duck main course was tough and disappointing albeit accompanied by a fine risotto. My wife's prawn dish in ouzo cream sauce was super-rich too.Inside the bar area (recently refurbished I understand) looked funky and welcoming.I think its pricey but I didn't pay so cant really comment on price other than to say my host would most certainly only have selected a good spot.

At a first glance you see the modern design (Kartell or similar design chairs and tables) , the luxury on the tables (Riedel Crystal glasses and cutlery) and nice location.So the first impression is nice.But when it comes to the service the things are getting really bad, especially for a restaurant of this class and of course those prices.Actually there is a very big delay in all phases of a dining night. We were waiting to be brought the menus, we were waiting for the wine, we were waiting a lot for the starter. But what it was very annoying was the time elapsed between starter and main course. It was near 45! minutes. As you undestand this is unacceptable for such a restaurant. And this happened not only to us but as far a i could understand to all tables. Also we were waiting to pay and we were seeking for a waiter for more that 10 minutes! to give the credit card/What i liked in this restaurant is the wine service. We have ordered a Merlot wine and probably for first time in Cyprus it was brought in the right temperature (15- 16 Celsius) and they kept it like this in an ice container. In most cases in Cyprus Restaurants, red wine is served directly from their storage places and wine temperature is near 25 Celsius! Also the food is really good, fresh and well cooked.Concerning prices, these are certainly high, but at the same level of all rest restaurant of this class in Nicosia. The wine again, is about 4 times more expensive than you buy it in a wine house! As i wrote again i believe that a normal price is 2.5 times more expensive.Another bad thing in this restaurant is the fact that tables in summer are installed outside on the pavement. Of course people that are walking are obliged to walk in the road since pavement is full of tables. But concerning people that are dining this is a bad environment. For example our table was behind a big chipboard of a construction company that was renovating the building next to Domus....I really expected that this restaurant was a step above the rest so called ""gourmet"" Nicosia restaurant but i was disappointed .",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 165 Similarity,0.143019388

50,When visiting nicosia we have always enjoyed delicious meals at your lovely restaurant. The only issue that caused some discomfort was the overly flirtive manner towards my husband by your waitress but we put this down to her generally immature demeanour. However our latest visit was made extremely uncomfortable as she blatantly ignored my presence and i asked her to leave us. She went on to distract your other staff until i visited the washroom at which point she returned to my husband who also asked her to leave. I complained to your waiter who did not seem to understand what i was saying and requested to speak to the manager to which i was informed that he was unavailable. The final straw came a few minutes ago when we realised she has also sent my husband a friend request on socialmedia which naturally was declined. I am sure you agree that this is unacceptable behaviour for a member of staff working at a high class and otherwise excellent restaurant.We are planning a double celebration for our thirty fifth wedding anniversary on new year eve and were considering coming to you with between twelve and sixteen guests.

They charged 5 bottles but we had much less so we complained to the manager, and he tried to convince us that they would never do such a thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ After a long discussion he charged us only two bottles and he offered to buy us drinks.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 92 Similarity,0

50,"It's excellent for people who want a relaxing night with friends with a variety of wonderful cocktails and wines. The place is also perfect for a romantic dinner in a quiet location of old town. I didn't try their food though, but when I went before 2 weeks it was crowded so you've better make a reservation.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 110 Similarity,0
50,Fusion Cuisine mixing classic with modern quite well. A very beautiful building in the old city. The interior is very nice and cosy. A bit pricey but worth every cent.,Domus Lounge Bar,Review 115 Similarity,0
