30,"this location is very important for Cypriots as it is the location where the Archbishop Palace, Folk Art Museum and the Byzantine Museum are. The Palace cannot be accessed and the museums have some exhibits yet did not impress me much as this is the environment I grew up with. â€¦",Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation

40,This museum contains a really remarkable collection of religious icons and they are the highlight. There are a couple of interesting Cypriot paintings but on the whole that part of the museum is missable if you are pushed for time.,Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation
40,"you get quite iconed out, but it needs to be done. I had an audioguide which helped but icons are not well labelled, and I found myself listing to details about a different icon from the one I was looking at. Second room has lots about Turkish sales of Cypriot things in the occupied zone. Makes you realise how strong emotions are",Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation
40,"This is the place where Makarios III lived during the times he was president of Cyprus. It looks very nice and it is located in the centre of the Greek part of the city. We could not enter the building or the place, just saw it from behind the fence.",Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation
30,"The name of this institution is actually ""The Byzantine Museum"". It's simply an icon museum, most of which are not even from the Byzantine era (they are 16th century and Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453). I much prefer to visit the various churches around the island, rather having to be put through the political ramblings of the Greek Cypriot church. An interesting place to visit, but if you do have a car, just visit the various UNESCO World Heritage churches. Much more rewarding and enjoyable.",Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation

30,"This must be the most complete collection of early Christian Icons in the world. The topics are repetative and you need to be very interested to visIt. We had a guide who explained the central figusre of each item, and something of the person who comissioned it captured in smaller images around the edge. We had seen sufficient before we had viewed more than half. It's a place for the enthusiast.",Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation
40,This is a huge collection of icons some of which have a striking simplicity yet show great depth of feeling. This is particularly true of some of the depictions of the virgin and child. It is a pity that many of the smaller icons are hung too high on the walls so that it is hard to view them. I highly recommend a visit to the Foundation.,Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation
50,"Very-very interested.Located in the historical centre of the old town of Nicosia, in the yard of Archbishopic Palace and next to 14th century Saint John Cathedral. There is an entrance fee but surely is worth while to be visited especially for those who love to see Byzantine Orthodox icons dated ages back.In this collection you will see the Kanakaria Mosaics and some other ancient icons that were stolen by antiquities' smugglers from the Turks' occupied area but now return back by the forreign authorities.",Archbishop Makarios III Cultural Foundation
