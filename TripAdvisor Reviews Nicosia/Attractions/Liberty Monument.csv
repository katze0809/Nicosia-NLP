50,"A monument that is rapped up in the Turmoil of Cypriot History. It was erected in 1973 to commemorate the release from prison in 1959 of EOKA fighters. It shows a statue of liberty overseeing two EOKA heroes tugging on chains in order to open prison gates and release Greek Cypriot prisoners, peasants and clergy, from British colonial rule.You will notice that there are no Turkish Cypriot prisoners being released, as they were considered to have been allies of the British during colonial times. Remember, this is 1973, and Turkish Cypriots had by then, to all intents and purposes, become non-citizens. This adds to the interest and controversy. The statues themselves are very well defined and realistic. Overall a very well executed monument albeit one that causes some debate.",Liberty Monument

30,Liked the bronzes. Excellent life-size figures. Sadly we didn't know who they were supposed to be. Were they actual EOKA figures or representations of typical supporters as it were? And who is the lady on top of the pillar? Aphrodite perhaps? Minerva? Would have been so much more interesting with a board or a plaque telling us what we were looking at.,Liberty Monument

50,"Beautiful monument, dedicated to the liberty of the Cypriot people from the British (I think). Within the Venetian walls, it consists of a white ""table"" with grey statues coming out of a cell and up the stairs, symbolising the Cyrpiot population. There is also a big statue at the top pointing to the sky, and two soldiers that are opening the gate for the prisoners. The idea and symbols are wonderful, very poetic, and the detail of the people still in the cell, and their faces and expressions are absolutely fantastic. Wonderful artwork, worth going to see!",Liberty Monument
50,"Even though we did not have time to stop and take a good look at it, it was nice to see it from the car in sundown when the sun provides a special lovely light. I have visited several countries in the last 6 months and for me it is mind blowing how we (people) make monuments to remember fights, the dead and holocousts...

30,This rather overworked tableau sculpture to liberty is to be only viewed at night as during the day it can be seen to be a bit of a social realist cliche. Lit up it can actually be quite dramatic.,Liberty Monument
