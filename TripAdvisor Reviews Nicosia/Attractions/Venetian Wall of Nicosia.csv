40,"The wall is well preserved and now they are creating new park and walking areas. It’s interesting to view also the gates Nicosia gates, Famagusta gates etc",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The longest preserved medieval walls in Europe, surrounding the entire old city. It has three gates and eleven bastions.Although in good condition, they can be seen only from the ouside of the walled city and around bastions. The fact that you walk upon them is impressive.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,We enjoyed our little walk around old Nicosia. We stumbled by an outdoor market where farmers were hacking there produce that was situated by the wall. A soccer match was being on a field within the walls it was a cool find,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"You can walk not quite near it because most of it is under construction, so let's say it is nice, but it isn't anything special. We walked for about an hour and finished it. Make sure it wasn't raining days before, because there is no trail on some parts, just grass. However, you can see also a part of the old town (just some ordinary streets but it looks nice). We ended it at Famagusta gate.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,Well preserved ancient wall surrounding the old city. You can see it by naked eye. Interesting to be viewed mainly that it is renovated and compounded with new and old building surrounding the area,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed with the Venetian walls of Lefkosia (Nicosia). On any map of the city, the circular but slightly odd star-like (or snowflake-like) shape of the wall lulls you into a sense of thinking that the walls something magical, a great stone construction that defines Nicosia and provides an amazing tourist attraction to its visitors.The walls form a border around Lefkosia’s Old City, and were built by the Venetians in the 16th century. They were built of mud brick, with only the lower part buttressed by stone. When the Ottomans occupied Lefkosia, they repaired the walls and covered the upper part with stones. The walls were fortified by eleven heart-shaped bastions and protected by an 80-metre wide moat. Five of the bastions, Tripoli, D’Avila, Constanza, Podocataro and Caraffa, are in the southern sector of Nicosia (Lefkosia). The Flatro Bastion on the eastern side of the Old City is occupied by Turkish, Greek Cypriot and UN military forces. The remaining bastions, Cevizli, Musalla, Cephane, Zahra and Kaytazağa, are in North Nicosia (Lefkoşa).The reality of the walls being a major feature of the city is somewhat overstated, from a tourist point of view. Whilst the walls are still largely intact (apparently), they are in places really difficult to see and appreciate, and carparks. the bus station, and various constructions seem to blot out the grandeur of this fortification, (or example the new modern entrance to Ledra Street at the D’Avila bastion where the Town Hall, and a curious glass sculpture, is located. You can’t walk around the walls in its entirety, as the Green Line and the eyesore that is the buffer zone prevent a complete circumnavigation of the wall. There are no crossings on the wall between Lefkosia and the Turkish-occupied north. The moat no longer exists, and is now used for playing fields and carparks.In Lekosia I followed the road on the top of the wall as far as I could, from the Pafos Gate in the west, to the Green Line in the east, just beyond the Caraffa bastion. The best spot to really see and appreciate the grandness of the construction was on the stretch between the Podocataro bastion and the Caraffa bastion, where you’ll find the Famagusta Gate. Here, the sheer height of the wall, and its solid construction, are clearly evident. Walk down Plateia Archiepiskopou Makariou, so you can look back up at the walls, as it’s a really good spot to appreciate the sheer strength and enormity of this Venetian construction. The walls seem to be really well preserved here. The two ‘gates’ which I’ve mentioned - the Pafos Gate beside the Kaytazağa Bastion, and the Famagusta Gate at the Caraffa bastion deserve more than a cursory glance, and I’ve reviewed them separately. The bastions are built upon, with public buildings, mosques, and the occasional grand statue (the Liberty Monument on the Podocataro bastion is interesting).In Lefkoşa (the occupied north) it was even more difficult to get decent views of the Venetian walls; I saw a stretch by the Kyrenia Gate which was nicely preserved.See what you can, and enjoy!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"They surround all of Old Town Nicosia, both on the South and North side. You can walk around the enjoy the views.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

40,"Interesting to see these historical walls that surround the main city. Must have been a lot of hard work for the people who built them many years ago, but I would imagine they did the job of keeping the city safe",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"The fortress of the city were designed and built five centuries ago. Beautiful design but ineffective and non functional during a battle, they finally couldn't protect the Venetian army from the Ottoman invasion. Good example of a beautiful and artistic design but not useful for the purpose of creation.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The venetians did a good job, this walls are the best preserved Renaissance fortifications in the Eastern Mediterranean",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

30,"Very impressive from the historical and architectural perspective, miracle they’re still there. However, they didn’t strike a particular impression on me in the divided city with more walls, barriers and fences. Also, not sure it was possible to walk on any stretch of the wall maybe for som nice views of the city?",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

50,It is amazing to see the ancient walls standing there in pretty good condition. It looks very beautiful from the map.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"If you go to Nicosia, you will unavoidably see those walls during one of your walk at the circumference of the city! Dated back to the Venetian occupation of Nicosia, they are the testimony of that period and some of the doors which used to provide access to the walled city are still standing (notably the Famagousta gate).",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"I think the historic Venetian walls was not as woo as I expect. Maybe this is due to the post-war destruction and the walls didn't rehabilitate and show more shocked history as I saw in the museum. I saw people would walk their dogs along the wall and the dogs pee somewhere in the shadow along the wall. That made me feel.......less exciting for this. I walked for 30 mins back and for to try to see the whole view of this wall but the direction was quite messy and unclear. If you really wanna take a look, go ahead but don't expect too much.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"This walls are a testament of the Venetian occupation that existed in this area, as very few other 'remnants' exist on the island.They are well built, no wonder they can be seen even from the satellite view.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

40,but sadly breached by the Ottomons! Looked very robust and magnificent . Imagine water in the moat! Most amazing!,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"A great piece of history but I found there to be a lack of signage. If a friend hadn't told me what they were,I would have assumed they were just part of an old wall that was now surrounding a car park!The lower grounds have some park areas. Most of the time there were just locals laying around and smoking! Not the sort of area is let children play",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,Its surprising how good a condition these walls are in. Its certainly different from the usual ruins one finds across Europe. Well done Cyprus.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
20,"the walls are long and nice. But we could not find an entrance. Finally, we went through some stairs and found an 'entrance' but we were disappointed since the area around the walls is not clean, there are 'strange' men walking around, dog waste, waste in general. The municipality must clean the place and find some use of it. I would not dare to walk there in the evening. must be dangerous and scary.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

The walls have a circumference of 5km, and contains eleven pentagon-shaped bastions named after eleven noble Venetian families of the city.

Hopefully the walls can one day encompass the city undivided.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

40,"Part of what makes the old city of Nicosia so fascinating is the Venetian Walls. They surround the city (both sides) and are intact today, centuries after they were built for defensive purposes.On the west Turkish side, there are some restaurants where you can eat atop the walls and look out/down through barbed wire into Cyprus.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Having fallen once from almost the top, i can certify that the Venetians new their stuff. I used to climb at a certain point - in order to shortcut close to Famagusta Gate, before repair work has been done to extensive parts of the wall, to repair them in their original form. One of the best examples of 16th century Military Architecture",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,Big walls for a walk around the city. Not good if the day is rainy. due to muddy ground. Well preserved.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"(May Allah have mercy on his soul) is a local researcher and a great admirer of Nicosia, his hometown. In his book “Nicosia of Yesterday and Today” he skilfully and accurately describes the historic walled city, her neighbourhoods, ancient monuments, old houses and gardens etc while he paints a vivid and detailed panoramic view of the modern present day Nicosia.Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, who bought Cyprus from the Knights Templars, who had bought it from Richard the Lionheart, brought many noble people from Europe and Jerusalem to the island to whom he allocated land that belonged to the Orthodox Christians of the island. The indigenous people became serfs under the feudal system introduced by the Frankish rulers, with hardly any rights. Nicosia was proclaimed the capital of the Kingdom of Lusignans. In due course the ruling class amassed a huge wealth, a great part of which was expended to develop the city architecturally. A lot of palaces, mansions, monuments, hundreds of churches including Saint Sophia Cathedral and monasteries were built. The Lusignans also surrounded Nicosia by walls with gates as the part of the fortifications of the city. However the Venetians were not impressed by what the Lusignans had done for the city as they wanted to control Cyprus for purely military and economic reasons. The island’s strategic position enabled them to dominate all eastern trade routes and Cyprus was also a rich source of good timber for shipbuilding, an important asset for a maritime state. So the Venetians were more interested in increasing the defensive capability of Nicosia in case it was attacked by the Ottomans. Therefore they destroyed a large number of the original Lusignan buildings including about 80 churches to construct new fortifications which they thought would stop the Ottoman army from conquering it.During the Lusignan rule when a group of pilgrims were on their way home from the Holy Land they came to the island as well and visited Nicosia. The King was very welcoming towards them and he provided them with decent accomodation and also gave them a gift of one hundred fowls, twenty sheep, two oxen, four vessels of a very good red wine, four skins full of a very good Marboa wine and plenty of very good white bread. The French nobleman Orient D’Anglure notes in his memoirs that four days later, on 9th January, the King sent them presents again including one hundred partridges, sixty hares and five wild sheep. The generousity of the King is an indication as to how rich the city had become albeit at the expense of the local people.Although Nicosia was surrounded by walls it had many gardens that were planted with citrus trees such as lemons, oranges and pomegranates; grapes, vegetables and potates etc. The gardens were irrigated with water drawn from wells. A large amount of land was also available to grow grains such as wheat and barley. The walled town abounded with cypress and date palm trees. However the wealth of Cyprus in general and Nicosia in particular decreased by a substantial amount during the Venetian rule as 2/3 of the tax revenue was sent to the Republic of Venice. The state of the city was not any better during the early years of the Ottoman rule. Although the Turks built a number of inns, baths and fountains and new bazaars and introduced improved handcrafts such as weaving and leatherworks that helped the town to continue to be a commercial centre it actually took many years for the city to re-capture its glorious Lusignan past.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The Medical Walls are evident in some places and have been built over and incorporated into the city in other locations. The ""green line"" divides the wall and ramparts between the Cypriot Greek and Turkish sides. There are three main gates, Paphos and Famagusta on the Greek side and Kyrenia on the Turkish side. In some areas, the UN barrels and barbwire is evident.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,To see the high thick walls that once kept the city safe is like going back in history. When we were there there was a large state ceremony going on with many dignitaries and high stepping military officers bearing many flags - interesting and from another world.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"Well I guess what is special about them is that they are still there. The idea of bastions is pretty normal in several walled European cities, but most are gone. These are still all there, but are sort of unobtrusive, since the are not high, they more or less develop a dry moat . For me the inteesting aspect was how they morphed form Greek to Turkish side. The Greek Cypriots seem to invest a lot in fixing them up, creating a park like area around them and using the rest for parking lots. There are some remaining gates, which are modestly interesting.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,These defensive walls surround Nicosia and were first built in the Middle Ages. They were then rebuilt bythe Venetians in the 16th. century.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia

50,"Most of the walls on the Turkish side are very run down and haven't been properly looked after. However, this is not the case on the Greek side as they seem to be in much better condition. I walked the whole way around the walls on both sides of the checkpoint and this is well worth doing if you have the time as you then do not miss anything worth seeing.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

40,"Big majestic walls that surround the old part of Lefkosia. It's nice to walk past them, and be able to see the medieval side of the city, and the views from the pavement of the walls and underneath are very pretty. Nice for photo taking, although maybe they could be a little more interesting. We didn't walk down and around them, just on the pavement up above, but you can if you want to. Continue on, and you will reach the liberty monument. Worth it for a stroll around!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

50,"Fortification walls and castles in Cyprus we have from 7th century AD onwards due to the Arab raids.The Franks rulled Cyprus from 1192-1489.They had rectancular stone walls with 12km perimeter.When the Venetians took over Cyprus in 1489 reconstracted the walls in 1567.It was Juliano Savognian who did the reconstruction. He demolished the Frankish walls and came out with round shape walls 5.5 km perimeter and 11 bastions , representing the 11 provinces that the Venitians devided Cyprus at the time.

30,walls like any other old walls. important is what is inside; two different worlds separated by wires...,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"These Venetians were really busy building defensive walls wherever they went! And so it is with the city of Nicosia. The Venetian presence is quite strongly felt with these huge fortification walls covering a large section of the city, but also serving as some sort of dividing line between the two communities living there today. The Greek and Turkish populations have never really had anything to complain about against each other as they lived happily enough for many years side by side. Unfortunately politicians, as is usually the case everywhere, have decided the fortunes of this city, and the whole island. It is worth coming to this place just to have a look and make up one's mind.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,It is interesting because of its history but not an awful lot to see. I have viewed from both the Greek and Turkish sides and good to visit if for nothing else to say that you have seen it and photographed same.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,Very important view for tourist to understand the history of Nicosia. A nice place to go for a walk with your other half.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Very impressive walled divided city with lots of shops, eateries etc. Walked around within the Turkish territory. Great alleyways to meander around and a blue painted line for tourists to follow as this city is divided and one needs a passport to cross over to the southern side. Recommended but take your passport to see it properly",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,The Venetian wall constructed out of cut stone are amazing defensive structure around the old city of Nicosia. There are several gates of entery around the city. A moat is also used to protect the city. Part of the moat is still visible. The shape of the fortification is star shape. If you have time you can walk around and see this massive structure.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia

50,"Almost perfectly , not only the island, not only the capital of Cyprus but the Venetian wall too, is divided into the Cypriot part and the turkish. The Cypriot refer to this partition as occupied territories.So you actually once visit the same wall in Cyprus and after you pass the border-yes-with passport control, you visit the rest of it in turkish territory.We reached Nicosia or Lefkosia as in Cyprus or Lefkosa as in turkish,by buss from Larnaka.It is an one hour + drive but very comfortable.It stops gust a few meters from the wall in Nicosia and very close to the famous Lidras street which takes you strait to the border with the turkish Nicosia.We walked along the Venetian wall towards the Famagusta gate. Inside the gate there was an art exhibition ,entrance free of charge.The walk takes less than an hour and passes by another three gates.This is the most visited gate and is worth this small walking effort.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,You pass the Venetian walls at various points as you enter the city of Nicosia. They have been integrated into the modern city and it provides an interesting contrast to the modern city.

30,The Venetian Walls mark the boundary of the old city and circles it with the bastions (most of them used as parking lots or parks) every few hundred meters apart. At the time of my visit lot of restoration work was taking place and the only distinct gate was the Famagusta Gate on the eastern side.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"It is a location that was inaccessible some years ago, now cleaned and been accessible by foot. Bus stop very near. Give it some more time, because it is around all old part of Lefkosia (Nicosia), the walk being both informative, romatic, making you feel a part of its past.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

40,If you are a history buff find time to learn the history of the many ancient walls surrounding the old city here.. so interesting to say the least.. passed them alot,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"I have to say, before opening my description, that I am a local, inhabiting the south sector of Nicosia.The approximately 1.2km in diameter Venetian walls of Nicosia were built in urgency following the Ottoman attack of Malta in 1565, when it became imminently clear that Cyprus would follow in the Ottomans' plans of conquest.The architect Giulio Savorgnan and engineer Francesco Barbaro designed a star shaped ring of slanted walls and arrow/heart shaped bastions, with 3 exits/entrances (North, West and East) surrounded by a moat (having to reroute Pediaios river to fill it in need), that could easily protect the city and changing war strategy and technology of the time.Using materials mainly from the old and outdated medieval Frankish walls that extended along a larger perimeter, the walls were built in around 3 years, starting from 1567, but money ran short and so the richest of the families were asked to contribute to its completion in return for naming each of the bastions their family name. The walls were never quite completed and the city fell to the Ottoman siege in 1571.Since English colonial times, the walls can be crossed over in many places, unlike when they were built when everything was esoteric, and walks in the inner city are truly picturesque, to say the least, revealing of the rich layered history of the most continually inhabited city in the world, of over 4500 years.Of the original gates, the most visually attractive is the Porta Giuliana - or Famagusta Gate having been preserved and restored in its original glory.To be able to see the whole circuit of the city walls and float in and around the 24 Parishes of the mixed culture and religious native history, you will have to cross over into either the Republic of Cyprus sector or the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (internationally unacclaimed but nonetheless real) so have your passport ready.Points of interest in the inner city vary, whether you are into architecture (eg. Famagusta Gate in the South sector, the Frankish 11th century St Sophia Cathedral known as Selimiye Mosque in the North sector, or churches and restored houses and mansions in both sectors, to name just some of the many worthwhile structures), museums or churches/mosques, sightseeing with scenic routes of narrow streets, or small shops and cafes/restaurants.Planned routes can be found in either side's tourist information offices, but make sure of the opening times beforehand.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

20,"You even pass the walls without seeing them when you're not attentive,and this not only through the big infrastructure works. Nicosia is not the real place to be when you visit Cyprus. It has no soul, no fire. The old town is not so old, 1930's. I personally was very disappointed to make the trip.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Well, for us is a lovely place to see and visit. These walls separate the ""old"" city from the ""new"" city... of Cyprus. I am not going to do a write up for its historical value since you can get this from million places.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,Walls in great condition as are the old city gates only downside is the length of time being taken to renovate eleftherias square many lovely old buildings to see including old archbishopric and Turkish baths and hammam,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"The venetion walls are stunning and mostly in very good condition, indeed the whole walled city is an excellent example of a large late medieval walled and fortified city. Sadly it is spoiled by partition, and most recently by a monstrous vanity project in Eleftheria Square. If only the vast sum spent on this carbuncle had been spent sprucing up decaying parts of the inner city!!!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

20,"The Venetian Walls of Old Nicosia have long been neglected. They symbolise much that is problematic both in the past and now that the city is divided. It's impossible in a short review to cover everything but the walls, like many things in Cyprus, were ineffective and the capital was quickly overrun. The old centre could be a wonderful place for locals and tourists with the Walls integrated into an overall plan. The current development of the square straddling the main entrance to the town will obscure and negate the Walls. Pity.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"This city is well worth a visit and recommend you take your Passport. The City is divided with full Passport Controls on both the Greek and Turkish side with a No Mans Land. Experience both the Greek and the Turkish sides of this great divide. There are a lot of walking, around the areas you will come to a dead ends and blockades so have your walking shoes on. We found the whole experience amazing, upsetting, educational and sometimes confusing and to be able to fully appreciate what is going off this is one of those must visit sites.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The size and scale of the Venetian walls makes them an ever constant sight in moving around the old city of Nicosia.

40,Nice to see the Venetian walls around the whole city. You have to go under a bridge to get in. Special experiance,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,The walles of old Nicosia are really worth while visiting. Superbly restored they offer an exciting glimse into the past. Go through the Famagusta Gate and you will experience the width of the walls that defended the city against the Turks.From the walls look down on the moat and imagine running the gauntlet of shot and arrows to place a ladder and climb up the facade of the battlements. Early morning or evening is best in the summer.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,The walk along and on the walls gives you a nice overview of the city's different faces. We did particularly like the part around the Liberty monument from which you have a nice panorama up to the mountains.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,There is sooooo much to see and visit in this wonderful city. I could have stayed a week just here!! Next time I will!,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"These walls round the city are extensive and give a tight knit feeling inside the walls that, on both sides of the divide mKe modern Nicosia such an interesting city. In the south work is going on to modernise the most areas in place. This is very welcome as there has been a dilapidated feeing in the past. There are significant car parks just inside the wall - I paid €3 for 4 hours by the Tripoli fort next to the main bus interchange.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,The walls of Nicosia are its main landmarks. They surround the old part of the city and separate it from the modern part. It is impossible not to come across or see them once in the city.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,The walls reflect the history of the passage of the Venetians and is a fairly well preserved monument . It is centrally located and has access to public transport.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,Always fascinated by history and the walls here do not disappoint. You can drive around the area or walk through Old Town to see the walls.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,You will pass the wall on the way into the city of nicosia.Not that much really to see and do on the wall.But those that are intrested the sheer size is worth a closer look.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,The walls are seriously impressive but feel a bit under whelming as there appears to be no effort made to make full use of them.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"The walls of Nicosia are amazing, having been completed in 1570, just in time for the Ottoman invasion. The walls didn't end up protecting the city and you will probably be frustrated with them too. Because Nicosia is divided you can't easily take a tour of the walls. The other problem is that they are surrounded by busy streets, so getting close to them means breathing fumes and being alert to Cypriot drivers, who are not the safest and most polite on the planet. Construction projects, both on the surrounding roads and in the moat of the fortifications also will stop you from admiring this fine example of middle aged military architecture.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"Nicosia is surrounded by intact walls.Thre are gardens around and parking places.Not very impressive, but nice for a stroll.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,We saw parts of the Venetian Walls of Nicosia. If we had the time we would have tried to walk around all that are standing / accessible and gain a true perspective of the city. One reason to return!. A good pair of shoes needed in places!,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,Like most Greek Islands; the Nicosia City was surrounded by a protective wall originally built with 11 gates; the walls and gates in the Greek part of the divided City are well preserved and are used for many regular Events and Exhibitions; it is under continuous development to enhance the historic value of this structure.The walls embrace the old Nicosia; with very narrow streets; many were turned to a lively pedestrian area with hundreds of shops and restaurants; the houses were all rehabilitated while keeping their traditional image.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,The walls are a stunning juxtaposition to the modern city that has grown upon and around its ancient foundations,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The walls are well preserved, incorporate them in your walking tour itinary but ensure you get a map and guide.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Venetian walls was built around the old town. When you use google map you will see exactly as they surrounded city. Today only a part of the wall remains, but they look amazing.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"Strange that the only capital city in Europe to remain divided (between Greek and Turkisk Cypriots) should contain medieval walls which span the two sectors. Built by one of the many occupying forces, in this case the Venetians, the walls encompass the old town with its bars, cafes and shops. The walls include parks and entertainment areas and the most active is the Famagusta Gate. Worth a wandering exploration.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,This is a beautiful old city with vibrant cafes and shops.Walk across the border to the occupied area to see a different lifestyle. Good shopping and sightseeing.Remember to take your passports with you to cross the border.They will accept all currencies but be careful with the exchange rate.Nicosia is the only city in Europe which is divided.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"Can't miss them. All around Nicosia, occupied and free, well preserved, either used as parking place or as amusement place for kids and other ceremonies and festivals. Summertime most visited nighttime on an occasion of music concerts and seasonal festivals.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia

40,"The Venetian walls have been maintained well and interesting to see how some parts have been turned into gardens and even a car park! As so close to other attractions, worth seeing.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"I just love these walls the alwYs look so impenetrable and are sitting there right smack in the middle of a city,They really are worthy of a visit,",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,The walls are less impressice than I thaought. In some parts works were going on and it was very noisy. Probably it will be a good place for recreation,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"When visiting a place that has walls can only mean one thing; that the place is rich in medieval history. The walls are an ideal example of the Renaissance in the Eastern Mediterranean. The fortifications were built by the the Venetians in order to protect the town from an Ottoman attack. However the Ottomans attacked the island during the Fourth Venetian-Ottoman War and were able to breach Nicosia in a three-month siege when the walls were incomplete. I believe that if the Venetians had the chance to complete the walls, they would have more time during the siege to bring some reinforcements from mainland Italy... It is really worth it to walk around them for half an hour and take some pictures.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,Walls around cities are pretty neat we have seen a few now these aren't the best nor the worst either Took photos so did make an impression Walked along them for a bit too,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"Following the path of the ancient Venetian walls of old Nicosia is a real treat. Start from near Famagusta Gate and follow them all the way around to Paphos Gate, and then if you like, continue on to reach Kyrenia Gate... It is a real treat!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Walls built to withstand an invasion that they finally didn't manage to withstand. And in the end, were used against the very people that ordered them built. Plus, so many more fascinating stuff to learn about these Walls. Also, beautiful in the evening!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,But not so high as you might have imagined. See them from both sides and walk a bit along them to have a real feel for it.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"I have been visiting this old city for years and today I have noticed that the enjoyable walk around the walls has been ruined by the low level of maintenance and rubbish laying around, if in the old city make sure to visit it but I was disappointed today .",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,Visted Nicosia several times but never befoe walked to length of the walls. Start oa Paphos gate and end at Famagusta gate.If you have your passport wlak through Ledra street and do the Turkish occupied area.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"Lovely place to visit with the old walls and narrow streets. There are lovely shops and restaurants, best shops in the are close to Tourist Information Office, they are tucked away.We visited the Turkish side of Cyprus, we passed through the checkpoints very quickly, passport needed. Really enjoyed seeing the two very interesting halves of a city.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,its very nice place for understanding What happened in island history. there are many places for small gift.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,We have driven past many times without actually going inside the gardens. We hope to remedy this one day,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"the wall kind of separates the old town from the hustle bustle of the city. the wall is broken at places, ends at the border between the Greek and Turkish parts (the part controlled by the UN in between)",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"During our free walking tour we walked along quite a bit of the walls. The green line cuts roughly straight through the middle, with observation points dotted along the line. The walls were built in the mid 16 century by the Republic of Venice, with three gates and a moat that was never completed to protect against Ottoman invasion. That didn't work. Witness 300 years of the Ottoman empire in Cyprus. In the 19 century access was cut through near Paphos gate by the British and more access later which we see today. Incredible feat of engineering accomplished in just 3 years by the Venetians.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,A very impressive sight taking you back in time for history lovers cross to the north to see Bayuk HanIt is hard to believe these walls are so old worth the visit,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,These ancient Venetian walls encompass the whole of the old part of Nicosia and are amazingly well preserved. Don't forget to take your passport if you want to walk round the walls in the north of Nicosia as these are still under Turkish control. It is now quite easy to access the northern parts from the end of Ledra Street.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"These walls have been affected by Nicosia's development over the years but there are sections which have been retained and regenerated, particularly in the south and eastern part of the town close to the Famagusta Gate. The walk around the top of them is pretty good and some of the views are impressive. They certainly give you a feel for the height and the security they must have offered the town in years gone by. However, there is not a great deal left so perhaps take them in between the Liberty Monument and the Famagusta Gate to see them possibly at their best.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"Best time to walk is during the evening just before sunset.1. Start from Pafos Gate. Its now restoring and soon to be open. Its also a good place to ""feel"" the green line that divides the city.2. Continue to Solomou Square where is the Central Bus Station. You get a closer look to the walls3. At D'avila Bastion is the Town Hall, a neoclassic building. Also you get to see Jean Nouvle's Tower 25 and soon Saha Hadid's Eleftheria Square.4. Next is Constanza Bastion with me mosque. Down the walls usually events happen like Nicosia Beer Festival or Christmas Market Park5. Podocatoro Bastion is visitable also during the day as there is the ""Freedom Statue"". During the afternoon and evening have a look down where the Park-Festival Venue is for some events, dogs playing or even couples6. End is the famous Famagusta Gate. The best way to end especially if there is some exhibition going on .",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,The walls are really impressive surrounded by an amazing garden. We went there for a wedding reception. Parts of it are available for receptions. Really impressive from the inside too.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"So nice to be able to enjoy a nice and relaxing walk along these walls, watching people talking and children playing. And of course admiring the strong Venetian architecture.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"If you are expecting a pedestrian walk only in the narrow streets of the old city inside the Venetian walls then beware! Bikes and cars seem to think they can park and drive anywhere and the tractor train.Crossing the green line is now a lot easier (July 2015), only need to give passport to be scanned at both check points as visa not now required. Make sure you get it scanned at both check points or you might be in trouble! Don't take photos around the greenline!Temperature is a lot hotter in Nicosia but dryer so not so tiring as the coast with it's humidity.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"We visited the walls which surround the old city of Nicosia in April, and we took a walk around and within the trench in the south part of the old town, below Stasinou and Salaminos street.It was really nice, and the most appropriate time to visit is in the evening, in order to avoid the heat of Nicosia.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"This is the original Venetian walls built around the old city of Nicosia in 1567. They are continually being restored and even though they are in the middle of a busy, modern city, they are still well preserved and worth a visit.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,Walking around the old town's walls gives you a good idea of how a medieval city would defend it self. Exploring the bastions and soon after walking beside the Famagusta gate sort of made me feel like I was travelling back in time. Good for people interested in medieval history and who enjoy walking. In my opinion the area is a bit underdeveloped; the bastions would make good places for public displays telling the history of the town.Sadly you can't fully explore the walls due to the city being divided.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"The traffic can get in the way, but try to walk around the walls to get an idea of the size of them. Some of the bastions are clearly visible.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
20,The Venetian Walls are totally unimpressive like a lot of things in Nicosia. In fact while looking for the walls we parked our car next to the wall without realizing as it is now an official car park.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"The walls embrace Nicosia, both the Southern and Northern sections. They are hardly visible from ground level, as they rise up from the once moat just outside the walls. When approaching from outside, one can see the real size and significance of the wall that was supposed to protect the city of Nicosia from regularly arriving invaders.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The first walls surrounding Nicosia were built by the Franks in the 14th century and enclosed a much larger area. When the Venetians occupied Cyprus in the 15th century they demolished the Frankish walls as they were inadequate against the weapons of the time. Also they were too close to the hills in the east and south east of the city. They are made of mud brick with the lower part buttressed by stone.When the Ottomans arrived they strengthened the walls and covered the upper part with stone.What you will see today are the walls with eleven bastions surrounded by a 80 metres wide moat. The moat is now used as a pleasant grassed area, public gardens and concerts.It's an interesting walk to appreciate the history of the city.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
10,"Like most things in Nicosia, the Venetian walls have just been left in an undeveloped, rather meaningless state. They just sit there with no indication of what they really are or how they fit in with the history and present of the island. So much could have been done with a wonderful attraction if the feckless idiots responsible for Nicosia had the first idea of what they are about. Sad sad sad.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,These walls really give you a sense of the history of the place. Amazing to think they have lasted through the ages since the 15th Century.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"You can not help seeing these amazing defences on a visit to the old part of Lefkosia. The ancient bastions jut out from the walls into the now dry moat, where most of the space is used for modern carparks and sports fields. As these date from the 15th century there has been a certain amount of reconstruction but you get a very good idea about how the city was well defended, until it fell at the attack from the Ottomans!!!!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Let's face it, if I'd been invaded as many times as Cyprus has been throughout its long history I would build the best walls and defence I could to keep out the hordes. It looks like a moat was part of the outer part and these walls are what would put me off if I had conquering in mind in ancient times. The pity is that the building works around the site detracted from the area at present. Admittedly, Nicosia was very accessible in a wheelchair and there are many places to visit whilst walking around the perimeter. The only divided city in the world must have been magnificent in its glory days.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"These Venetian walls are a circle around the whole of Nicosia and not only in the north which a reviewer has described as 'turkish' meaning of course in the occupied part of the city, but the walls are all around Nicosia as a circle. North, south, east, west. The moat as it is known was full with water to keep attackers away, untli the turks mounted on ladders broke the defences at a point called Bayraktaris. These walls circling the free and occupied city are well preserved and look strong and impressive. Do not fail to visit the Famagusta Gate, which was the only entrance to the city open from sunrise to sunset. It is now a sophisticated place for high class cultural events and performances..",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Located in the Turkish north of the city the well preserved walls are an impressive sight and one marvels at thier width. Constructed by the Venetions who occupied Cyprus in the 15th Century But they were unable to defend the city against Ottoman attack, which took place soon after they were completed and it is thought that 20,000 citizens were killed..",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"According to the history, in 1567, the Venetians commissioned the Italian military engineers Giulio Savorgnano and Franscesco Barbaro to design new fortifications for the city of Nicosia to protect the inhabitants from imminent Ottoman attack. The new walls replaced the old-style medieval fortifications which engineers deemed inadequate to defend the city. The Venetians demolished several churches and palaces within the city as well as buildings lying outside the new walls, both for the acquisition of building materials and for a clearer field of vision for the defence of the city.At the same time, the Pedieos River was diverted outside the city either to protect the residents from flooding or to fill the moat encircling the new walls.Nonetheless, these fortifications were in vain, and the city fell to the forces of the Ottoman admiral Lala Mustafa Pasha in 1570 before the Venetians had completed their construction. The Ottomans captured the bastions almost intact, and they remained almost unchanged until the British era.We use to walk along the Walls and enjoy some open-air events, taking place during the year, such as Beer-Festival, ice-cream -festival and open-air musical and singing concerts.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,The walls look impressive and stretch throughout the old city. They are worth a look or even a walk along.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
20,The Venetian walls should be a major feature of the city. There are efforts to make more use of the landmark but they have been halted by the financial problems of the country and the discovery of significant archeology. As a result it is difficult to get a good view of the walls.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The Venetian walls of Nicosia are located in the northern part of this city.As well-known, Nicosia is divided into two parts: the northern part - inhabitated by Turkish people, and the southern part - inhabitated by Greek-speaking people. Both sides and people are lovely.As mentioned above, The Venetian walls are located is the northern part.Considering that these walls were built hundreds of years ago, and passed many historic events, it is positively surprising to note that they are some of the best preserved Renaissance walls in the Eastern Mediterranean.Practicaly, the walls look untouched by time and/or any historic event.All adult-tourists should see it and all kids should be guided to see it and be taught about it.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"Sloped walls of the old city for defence. These are easy to see in some areas, melded to the city in others.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
10,nothing more than one photo. Good area but nothing strange to think or to watch...Perhaps the goverment don't have enough attention for some area's in Cyprus,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,At the time of our visit they were working on many of the moat areas so there was limited access. On some of the bastions there are places of interest for instance Bayraktar mosque on the Constanza bastion,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,Huge old walls with a reconstructions on some parts of it. You can be friendly and simply ask archaeologist to explain you some main points from the history. Believe me this nice people will do a real excursion only for you. You can even walk through the closed area and do some pictures.,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
30,"Interesting but not much to see. Unfortunately, part of the wall is closed as there are reconstruction works.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,Unfortunately I spend just 1 hour in Nicosia but it's a very particular and beautiful town. The Venetian walls bring you to the past and once crossed the walls you begin to walk into the ancient town which is divided by the border. Going to Cyprus visiting the Capital is a must and there you should spend 1 complete day,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"Having worked in Nicosia for a number of years, i like to walk the walls. All the way from Pathos Gate to Famagusta Gate. You can see the history of it all !",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"This is really one of the major advantages of Nicosia. It gives a historic and medieval ""air"" although the city itself doesn't seem to be medieval. You can walk along the walls or admire them from your car while you drive along the walls. You can also have your lunch, dinner or coffee to enjoy different views of the Venetian walls, in of the many places that offer such an opportunity.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The walls are full of historic interest but are less impressive than you think, partially because of its integration in the city and partially because they are no so high. Anyway, a visit of the entrances and some of its parts is a must in this walled city",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"The walls of Nicosia surround the city like a star. Between the walls one can find small parks and also a dog park. At night, some parts of the walls are lighted and they create a wonderful atmosphere.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"The Venetian Walls (built in the French Lusignan period) which surround the Old City of Nicosia today, were originally built to protect the city from Ottoman attack.Today, they are a beautiful historic site to see.They form a circle and were fortified by eleven heart-shaped bastions. They were built of mud-brick with the lower part only buttressed by stone and were protected by an 80 metres wide moat.Nowadays this moat around the walls serves as sports fields, public gardens, car parks, open-air sculpture exhibition, and many more.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
20,"We entered the old city within the walls from the Kyrenian gate in north.The blue line on the ground which you are supposed to follow if you want to see the most interesting places - is almost vanished and hard to find in many streets. You get the sence of that nobody who lives here- cares of the historical values as everything is uncleaned, trash everywhere, historical walls and buildings non repaired, even demolished. You can see children playing football in trash, adults not interested in changing their mindset and ensuring that they do nothing to make things to the better. We, 9 persons, travelling a lot around the world - will not recommend to spend time here. Use your time somewhere else, your vacation is the most valuable time!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"One of the oldest sites in the city. Must see. Recently rennovated and an excellent spot to take pictures, especially after getting married at the Nicosia municipality. Visit the municipality website for more information.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,we drove into the old town of nicosia through a gap in the Venetian walls the old town is quaint and everything is within walking distance lots of historical sights grab yourself a map from the tourist information and off you go well worth a visit and only 40 mins drive from the coast,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
20,Nicosia is the only segregated city in the world and the stellar-shaped Venetian city walls are more-or-less bisected by the UN Green Line separating North & South Cyprus. I visited the North side & found the walls in a poor state of repair. Not displayed as an attraction they have been absorbed by the urban clutter of the capital. The area I explored saw the walls used as sentry posts; for UN watchtowers; the moat between the walls was a football pitch and one bastion was being used as a car park. No visitor information was displayed. Perhaps the relics are better treated on the Southern side?,Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The Venetian Walls have been surrounding Nicosia for centuries and still stand today, giving Nicosia an iconic octagonal type shape from above. The walls have paths around them which make for pleasant walking despite being amongst the hustle and bustle of the city center.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The Venetian walls surrounded Nicosia in a star-shape for centuries, now being the border between old and new. You can see the walls almost everywhere, but the best sights are near the Gates (Famagusta, Kyrenia, Paphos etc.)",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
50,"The first walls surrounding Nicosia were built in the 14th century by the Franks (Franci). When the Venetians occupied Cyprus, they decided to demolish them because they were old and did not offer adequate defense against new weapons such as artillery. The new circular Venetian walls were fortified by eleven bastions and protected by a wide moat. This moat (in Greek ""tafros"") now serves many different uses, serving as sports fields, public gardens, dog training fields, car parks etc.The moat is also frequently used as a place for open air concerts and music events, festivals and temporary amusement parks. You can park at the Tafros parking area and from there stroll around the public gardens that surround the walls. When you're done, you can climb back up to the street level. Ledras street with its many shops, cafeterias and restaurants is just a few meters away.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
40,"The Venetian Walls which surround the Old City of Lefkosa today are a beautiful historic site to see. Built in the Lusignan period, the structure of the Lefkosa city Walls was thinner and longer than they are present. The stones from that period were used to protect the inhabitants from an expected Ottoman Conquest. The city Walls have three entrance gates and eleven bastions, the latter named after the Venetian commanders who defended the city against the Ottomans.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia
