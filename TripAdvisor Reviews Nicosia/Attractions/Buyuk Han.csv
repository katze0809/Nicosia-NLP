40,"The whole Buyuk Han is very nice to visit, but what stood out to us were various little shops selling handmade products, homemade food items such as jams, spices etc. and much more. We originally planned to be there for half an hour, in the end we spent 2 hours browsing all the different things on sale. And since it was Sunday, not all of them were open! After shopping, we ate at a restaurant on the ground floor which was very cheap, and the food was tasty.",Buyuk Han

50,"A lovely 16th century construction , originally a caravanserai , that has been a prison and a sort of workhouse in its time but now attracts tourists and locals alike to the many restaurants , coffee house and craft shops that are now contained within its walls since the late 20th century restoration . In the middle of the courtyard there is a mini mosque . Here you can eat and drink or wander around the shops , and find some shade .",Buyuk Han

40,"tavernas, coffee shops, art/craft shops in a medieval courtyard setting. Can't help but relax... Enjoy!",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is an interesting and really nice place to visit. When we went, we had the feeling that time has stopped there.We didn't try the food, as it doesn't offer much choice for vigitarians but we were happy to browse the little craft shops and speak w ijth people there. Everyone is really nice and friendly and there wasn't that annoying persuasion from their side to make us buy their stuff.The prices of the items are really reasonable and you can pay in Turkish lira and in Euro as well.This is a different world and see definitely you need to visit it when i n Nicosia.",Buyuk Han
30,Been to seeing this place only to be disappointed. Wasn't even in there for more than 5 minutes. Won't be going again,Buyuk Han

50,We went for a short walk & visit to the occupied side of Nicosia and found this beautiful building full of shops & coffee bars!!! Perfect place to watch the world go by!!!,Buyuk Han
50,"The place still feels like a resting spot in the hot and busy city, once you have gone through the entrance. Look for it on the map because you easily might walk just by. In the old resting rooms there are many small shops of surprisingly good handicrafts. Not expensive, nice salespeople.",Buyuk Han
50,It was a fascinating place and well worth the visit. We had a lovely brunch there like nothing I have ever had before and were surrounded by such architecture. It was AMAZING.,Buyuk Han
40,"This place is great to visit especially if you are interested in the architecture/historical aspects of the building. The building is full of local vendors selling their wares, mostly ""ethnic"" or ""artsy"" types. Very nice for an outing. The wares seemed a bit expensive.It's located on the north side of Nicosia, the area still under the occupation of the Turkish forces. You have to cross the ""Green Line"" at Ledra street to cross over.",Buyuk Han

50,"We've been there from 3 years before, maybe more than 5 times per year. Very good drinks and traditional food.",Buyuk Han
50,"In my view the Büyük Han is Lefkoşa’s loveliest attraction, and should be included on any visit to the northern quarter of the divided city of Nicosia. It’s an impressive piece of Ottoman architecture, built in 1572 on the orders of the first Ottoman governor general of Cyprus, Mustafa Pasa. It’s an elegant, balanced and harmonious structure, built as lodgings (a motel, of sorts) for travelling salesmen and merchants, rather than for religious purposes.On entry, either from the west or the east, you’ll pass through huge doors, large enough to allow a fully-laden camel into the inner open courtyard.The almost square building has two floors; there were rooms on the lower floor available for various commercial activities, and rooms on the upper floor available as lodgings. These rooms had fireplaces for comfort and warmth; if you enter via the east doors you’ll certainly notice the curious hexagonal or octagonal chimney stacks on the roof line. The rooms on both floors were accessed by lovely vaulted galleries (verandahs) overlooking the courtyard.These days it’s not a hotel, but an arts and crafts centre. Various small retailers sell souvenirs, lace, pottery, postcards, jewellery and an assortment of other goods of interest to the tourist. There’s also a couple of cafes on the ground floor floor for meals and refreshments, and washroom facilities (with a charge).In the middle of the courtyard is a small domed mosque, with a fountain for pre-prayer ablutions. On the east side of the building (adjoining but separate) is a beautiful colonnaded arcade with ten or so more shops.It’s a beautiful spot to wander, to purchase some souvenirs, to photograph, and to sit in the shade and have some refreshments. I was really drawn to it, and returned a number of times to see it in different light. It was peaceful, and gave a great insight into the life of people during the city’s Ottoman period.Make sure you include it on your visit to Lefkoşa. It’s just off Arasta Sokak, the narrow main street that takes you from the Ledra Street Crossing (entry point into Lefkoşa from the south) towards the main mosque.",Buyuk Han
40,"We didn't spend a long time in the Han, but a quick look around found plenty of independent shops selling clothes and souvenirs, and places to eat in pleasant surroundings.",Buyuk Han
40,Was a nice experience to see 2 cultures and a peace of no mans land in a small area. Good to go shopping and a bit of culture.,Buyuk Han
50,The old centre of Nicosia is quite intetesting to see. Small shops and cafees are now located at the place. Take a tour around and feel the historical sentiment. We can recommend it.,Buyuk Han

40,"Buyuk Han is a lovely old preserved building with courtyard which used to be a place to stay years ago. Now there is a gallery with lots of art and craft shops. Friendly atmosphere. Good place to sit down away from the tourists crowd, have a drink or meal.",Buyuk Han
10,"Very old and interesting Temple but, there were many flies and we had a hard time eating a little. They have to do something for this issue",Buyuk Han
40,Arrived at Kyrenia gate and got an excellent walking Map from the Tourist Information office at the gate who noted the musts and the optional of the various places of interest. Whilst part of the tour it has a Central location with good western toilets (you need 50Cents). Lots or nice craft stalls and excellent cafes. Nice atmosphere. We had a drink and then returned for lunch. Nice and central to the other places of interest or for crossing into the South (don't forget your passports) let alone the shops. Interesting to compare the Euro south and the Turkish north which was so much more interesting and not so commercial. Take your time and enjoy the walking tour.,Buyuk Han
30,This fortress is filled with lots of souvenir shops and restaurants. Great history with the same ancient atmosphere like all old monuments.,Buyuk Han
40,The building itself is breathtaking architecture a few hundred years old. The restaurants inside let it down. Tourist oriented and of average quality. Some really good quirky shops on the upper floors and around it make any visit worthwhile,Buyuk Han
50,Love this place its a real picture opp as well try your best to make it here and have a little snack lemonade or beer as well in the restaurant inside there’s crafts and other things to look through it’s truly like stepping back in Cypriot time,Buyuk Han
40,"What a fantastic building. Originally a stopping point for traders, a room for the night!! Restored to its former glory with craftspeople occupying the individual rooms over two floors. A cafe/restaurant on one side of the courtyard gave us a welcome break from the heat of the day. Something the early travellers would have been glad to make use of I’ sure.",Buyuk Han
50,A very nice place in the Turkish area of Nicosia with good restaurants inside and many souvenirs shops at the first floor.,Buyuk Han
40,"Nice preserved building with courtyard and gallery with lots of artcraft shops. Friendly atmosphere. Good to sit down away from the tourists crowd, have a drink and a meal.",Buyuk Han

50,"Restored former caravanserai, historical building where you can eat, drink and browse arty shops, tourist shops and watch handwork in action.Beautiful building with a great atmosphere.You cam imagine people doing the same hundreds of years ago.Well worth a stop.",Buyuk Han
40,The architecture and construction around this site is very interesting and it was pleasant to visit.,Buyuk Han
20,"Büyük Han is an old han, but it is occupied by ordinary touristic shops. And they all sell the same stuff that only tourist are buying. Best you quickly pass through and visit Selemiye.",Buyuk Han

40,Visited here yesterday. An excellent opportunity to view how hans were built. Today it serves as a place with some restaurants and assorted craft shops. Worth the visit especially for the architectural value.,Buyuk Han
50,"The Buyuk Han in Nicosia is a must-see when visiting the city. For over 400 years, this former caravanserai has been the meeting place of merchants and traders from across Cyprus and the Mediterranean who brought goods such as silks and spices to exchange and sell. The upper rooms which once provided accommodation for the weary travellers are now occupied by craftsmen and small boutiques selling everything from handmade jewellery and scarves to leather goods, lacework and exquisite mosaics.The ground floor also has a range of souvenir outlets, as well as two cafes in which to enjoy a coffee or other refreshments. It is a modern update on the lovely old building's original funtion, keeping ancient tradition alive. Essential to visit",Buyuk Han
40,"Lovely little stop here, really interesting to read the history. We had a mooch around the little shops which sell handmade bits and bobs which cater to the tourists. I didn't want to buy anything but it was a nice place to visit. We did stop for a drink in one of the cafes which was amazingly cheap and had the loveliest owner. We people watched with a rose lemonade and a bowl of nuts and it was a charming place to spend some time after wandering around the cit",Buyuk Han

50,"Buyuk Han packs a lot into a small area. There are restaurants and many souvenir shops, so it's possible to spend a bit of time in there. The architecture is very beautiful and it was great to see a solid mix of tourists and locals. Definitely worth a look if you're in the area.",Buyuk Han
40,"We have visited some Hans around Turkey, but most of them were museum or out of order. It's fantastic to see how vivid could be a place like this.",Buyuk Han
50,Loved the vibes all around. Especially for souvenirs it’s the best place to find out different designs in reasonable price ..,Buyuk Han
40,Close to the Green Line is a sixteenth century caravanserai containing also a good value cafe restaurant.,Buyuk Han
40,"First of all, it needs to be said that this is located in North Cyprus, which obviously is Turkish culturally. So, the architecture was different than the rest of Nicosia/Cyprus, but the souvenirs being sold was the generic, tacky stuff you pretty much could find elsewhere. The immediate area surrounding Buyuk Han resembled one basic market, so you won't need to spend much time there at all.",Buyuk Han
40,"The place is interesting to see, very close to the border. Inside there are lots of handicrafts and a few restaurants to stay.",Buyuk Han
30,"Buyuk Han is a place to rest and eat in the Ottoman Empire, the beautiful architecture, full of souvenir shops and restaurants.",Buyuk Han
40,"The location seems a set to a movie, but the overall impression is ruined by all the tables and chair that crowd it.",Buyuk Han
40,This was a large market and has been for hundreds of years. It's kept in good shape. It now has touristy stuff but presumably used to have genuine wares for sale.,Buyuk Han
40,"The building is beautiful , worth a look. The shops are arts and crafts . knitted and crocheted things, art work, home made knick knacks, etc not really my think but free to walk around and look",Buyuk Han
50,Great place to snap-up some artisan bargains .. some lovely clothes and jewellery here plus several small and excellent eateries,Buyuk Han
50,"Beautifully renovated ""caravanserail"" very carefully renovated and offering restaurants and workshops for artists of all kind. Go for lunch, enjoy a chat with the artists and owners of the small shops - we enjoyed it so much and walked over the border in the only aim of going there. Love it!",Buyuk Han

50,Nice place to visitClean toiletsMany souviner shopsLow cost kliftiko at the reasturant inside (10 euros)Nice ancient placeAlwayes full of toursits,Buyuk Han
50,"The first impression is if I have entered into a movie set. Büyük Han is very well maintained but the old feeling is still there and strong. There are now different hand-craft goods stalls and restaurants. It is a very relaxed and friendly environment and you won't feel the hard-sell culture from Istanbul. Nobody will call you to sell you things. You can really relax and spend time to look at what they are selling without any pressure. If you are ready to buy, they are there to help you.",Buyuk Han
50,"This is a very interesting construction from Ottoman times. It served as lodgings for people traveling to Nicosia: the upper floor had bedrooms for guests, while the ground floor was for horses and merchandise. It has been restored in a rather careful way. There are cafes and restaurants inside and around the Büyük Han. This makes for a very pleasant and interesting short visit.",Buyuk Han

30,Market and restaurant place where once was a lodge for travelers on ancient period. Full of cats !!!,Buyuk Han
10,Not a nice place to visit.Especially because its in the occupied side of Cyprus.Its such a shame because such a beautiful and old city like Nicosia has checkpoints,Buyuk Han
50,Visiting Buyuk Han is like going back in time. Located on the Turkish occupied area you will feel the atmosphere you breath in aTurkish bazaar.,Buyuk Han
40,"Typical Chan that has been restored faithfully and made tourist friendly without overbearing vendors or beggars. Stroll, have lunch and learn the history.",Buyuk Han
50,We travel to Nicosia regularly and always sit in the Buyuk Han and have 'pies' - these are small pastries filled with mince or sweet cheese and are excellent. They have a good explanation of how the BH was renovated. Really a good starting point to visit the City,Buyuk Han
40,We had lunch in the restaurant within this and then walked around the little shops which were lovely. An amazing building which has only just been renovated.,Buyuk Han
40,"Visited as part of free tour, great history to the site, few lovely craft shops and nice place for a coffee or Turkish tea",Buyuk Han

50,"Well, this is tipical Turkish part of CY what to visit. Full of history and realle nice atmosphere! Recommended!",Buyuk Han
50,One not to miss in Nicosia. It’s a beautiful building that may look very touristy at first. Spend more time here and you’ll find some inexpensive local handcraft and really friendly people. We started our tour of Nicosia with Buyuk Han and came back for one final coffee stop after checking out the old Nicosia.,Buyuk Han
40,Located at the occupied part of nicosia by visiting this place and learning it's history the visitors can realise how Greeks and Turks use to leave together and meet in harmony,Buyuk Han
50,"Stumbled upon this little area tucked away whilst we were wandering round the narrow streets of the Northen Side of Nicosia. We were impressed by the history and the architecture of the little square. There is a small old mosque inside the centre which you can peek into if you climb the stairs. Around the edges there are little shops, which were mainly closed during our visit on a Sunday, but there was a lovely little bookshop where they held books of all languages, and a shop selling beautiful handmade turkish lamps made of glass mosaic. (I ended up buying 3!) The shopkeepers were very friendly and we enjoyed walking around the top level as well as the bottom and admiring the structure. We ate a meal in the restaurant in the middle of the square and we were not disappointed! The menu variety was good and the prices very reasonable for the size of the meals! The food was very tasty and the man who owned the restaurant was so welcoming and friendly and gave us free maps of Nicosia and other towns in the North. We sat outside and heard the call to prayer which sounded beautiful echoing round the square. We would visit here again even if just for the food!",Buyuk Han
30,had a wander around here early afternoon. Theres a few restaurants serving lunch etc as well as a few craft shops selling local souvineers as well as the tourist crap.,Buyuk Han
40,Very nice location with restaurants and shops. local products and arts. But the most interesting thing is the building itself and the former use of this place.,Buyuk Han

40,"we visited 18 years ago and where the only visitors. Now its full of tourist shops and some small cafes. Don’t know what’s better, but it’s sure worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
40,Beautiful building surrounding a courtyard of restaurants and shops. The upper story also houses gift shops. I bought the only thing that I have bought while traveling in years: a brass coffee mill (actually a coffee grinder). If you are looking for a pepper mill that actually works.... buy on of these!,Buyuk Han
40,I like this placeMany shops and restaurantsAnd very lovely place to relaxQuite and nicely decorated,Buyuk Han
50,Loved every second while being at the Buyuk Han. Ate at the restaurant there and had a pretty relaxing experience. This place embodies history. It was built in 1572 by the Ottomans. It was a lodging for businessmen who were passing by. In the middle you’ll find the domed building in which the muslim businessmen used to do wudu’ for prayer and pray. The doors in the lower part of the Han were stables for the horses and the upper part rooms were the rooms they rented for the night. You’ll find shops within the rooms today and a restaurant on site. You can pay by Euro or Turkish Lira its no problem. A must see.,Buyuk Han
40,Interesting building with a lot of souvenirs and craft shops and a restaurant. It tends to be a little expensive though.,Buyuk Han

40,"This is a very beautiful example of Ottoman architecture, in the heart of Nicosia. This used to be a place of refuge for travellers, now it is home to craft shops. There is a balcony that overlooks the central courtyard and prayer space in the middle. Take a few pictures and then stop for a drink in the cafe before carrying on with your walking tour of Northern Nicosia.",Buyuk Han
50,"Really nice artist work, you can pay in euro, for sure the exchange rate is not good for you, but it makes it easier. The place has a nice atmosphere. Don’t hurry and take some time to walk, watch and enter each store. Don’t forget to go upstairs to the first floor, many nice and unique stores there as well.",Buyuk Han
50,"Beautiful historic building from 1574, a must see location with nice small shops and a restaurants. Great place to experience Cyprus from Ottoman times and a special historical monument. Amazing!",Buyuk Han
50,"They built Buyuk Han after the model of Koza Han in Bursa: both are indeed lovely! The food and souvenir prices inside the Han are based on Euros, but please do visit the historical second hand bookshop owned by a historian & take a look at his collection of books, did not want to leave there!!",Buyuk Han
50,"On the weekends you can shop the trade of local artists and the food in restaurant is good but my husband and I enjoyed lemonade, beer and homemade Cypriot dessert. Wonderful picture opportunity!",Buyuk Han
40,"Full of character and interest, this 450 your old building is fascinating. Once through one of the two great entrances you are greeted with an open space at ground level (much of which is taken up by an adequate cafe / restaurant) and a good number of artisan workshops on the upper level. Go upstairs and wander round to find all sorts of interesting artefacts and friendly people.The cafe downstairs is OK and have the right money for the loos!",Buyuk Han
40,A place with character. It’s located on the north side of Nicosia and it a walking distance from the the crossing point at Ledra Street. We were told that it was a khan or hotel built by the ottomans.It’a a place where a large number of artisans are gathered with plenty of souvenirs and also restaurants.Plenty of photo opportunities and a place where you can relax and be taken back in time.,Buyuk Han
40,"This place is 500 years old, and has all the flavour of history attached to it.There are two levels to it, with artisan craftsmen and women making assorted items forsale, plus a restaurant. It is a haven of peace and tranquility from the busy marketoutside. It has a long history, and is a must if you are in Nicosia.",Buyuk Han
40,"The Büyük Han is Cyprus' best-preserved example of Ottoman caravanserai architecture. Built in 1572 by the first Ottoman governor of Cyprus, Lala Mustafa Pasha, it was renovated in the early 1990s, and has once again become the hub of North Nicosia's Old City bustle. The courtyard is home to a couple of cafes, including the ever-popular Sedirhan, and traditional craft workshops are housed in the small cells leading off the 1st-floor balcony that originally served as the inn’s sleeping areas.During the Ottoman period, hans (inns) like this one were used as hotels for travellers and traders. The ground-floor rooms rimming the courtyard functioned as stables for horses, storage areas and shops where traders could carry out their business.The central courtyard has a mescit (Islamic prayer room) in the centre, which is balanced on six pillars over a şadırvan (ablutions fountain). This design is rare; it's found only in this han and two others in Turkey.",Buyuk Han
20,"Buyuk Han is (unfortunately) located in the Turkish part of Nicosia. The only good side of Turkeys’ Nicosia is that you can eat a great meal for a small buck. Besides of that, there is not really a lot to do.Don’t buy clothes there if you have to carry them across the Greek border if you don’t want to find yourselves in trouble.The Greek part of Nicosia, unfortunately, sucks big time because all worthwhile places to visit are since July 20, 1974 illegal occupied by the Turks.Nicosia, and that goes for entire Cyprus, could be a so much better place if the Turks would withdraw.(I don’t understand why this not revoked by the UN)",Buyuk Han
40,"Get the feeling of how a bed and breakfast in the past looked like - this place was actually a ""kervansaray"" so a place where caravanas would stop for a night. There were lodgings for the merchants on the upper storey, each heated by its own stove, hence the row of chimneys on the roof. A historic place dating back to the 16th centrury, also used to serve as a prison for some time. Now an outback oasis with a restaurant an a few souvenir shops. Beautifully restored.",Buyuk Han
50,Today we decided to go to Buyuk Han which is ALSO called Archbishop Makarios III foundation. It was so hot but so entertaining.,Buyuk Han
50,"Great old well renovated building, used to be a hotel 500 years ago or so. You can admire the pictures from the times before and after renovation and the result is amazing. Would recommend to anyone in Nicosia.",Buyuk Han
30,"Its nice to visit and look at all the people. But that’s it. Nothing much to tell than some souvenir stands, restaurants/bars inside. And the blue blue sky above.",Buyuk Han
50,"This revived old caravanserai, or camel caravan inn, is a delightful place to find Turkish Cypriot handicrafts as well as to find a good, locally made, traditional meal. The building itself is beautiful, and the food is good and not too expensive. Best of all are the people: the craftspeople in their shops, and the workers in the restaurant. They're all wonderful.",Buyuk Han
50,"The biggest caravansarai in Cyprus is beautifully restored (in the 1990s) and was built in the second half of the 16th century by the Ottomans. In the middle of the courtyard is a small mosque with fountain for ablution, the two story squared building houses several art galleries and workshops as well as restaurants.It is a nice place to sit and relax from sightseeing or shopping in Nicosia while it is a sight itself. Be aware that at times groups of tourists ""invade"" the Han.",Buyuk Han
50,The two story square shaped trade palaces were called Han in Ottomans. Ottomans built many hans in almost each city under their rule. Han buildings were standard architechtures. This is a very good example of a Han.1. Small building in the middle: Upstairs is mescit (Chapel in Muslim terminology). Ground is cistern2. Visit the hand made shops upstairs and support them by buying at least one small piece3. The restaurant is vey good. You can have something to rest,Buyuk Han
40,This is worth the visit simply to understand how communities functioned in the past if you are willing to see beyond all the cheap crafts that are there now.,Buyuk Han
30,"This is one of the largest Hani in Nicosia. Unfortunately it has become a place of cheap, on the whole, tourist orientated products and this is a shame as it could have been so much more. Thankfully, it has been well preserved as a building.",Buyuk Han
40,It is now like a market place with many small stores. Quite a few are owned by the artists themselves.,Buyuk Han
40,"We didnt eat at this place, but we just visited. A very beautiful place with very interesting building. Worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
40,This place is eerily beautiful in the early morning before the shops open. Had coffee there and a sweet can do girl gave us a cheese sandwich.It was pleasant .later in the day it was manic. Very beautiful architecture. History interesting too.Must visit,Buyuk Han
50,"Called here whilst on a visit to both N & S Nicosia; this building built by the Ottomans during 16thC is in the more interesting Turkish section of Nicosia, and is a must visit when in town. Its name literally translated means ""Great Inn"" and that's exactly what it was, a sort of caravansari, a place for travellers to stop over for food and shelter. It is a square 2 storey building round a central courtyard, which in olden times contained shops, stores and stables on the ground floor and sleeping quarters on the first. It passed through many nations hands over the centuries, was even used by the British as a prison at one time and for a long time left in ruins. There are some interesting old photos dotted round the inner walls showing how it was, before it's renovation during the mid 20thC In the centre of the courtyard is an interesting octagonal building, called a Masjid, which in fact is a prayer room ascended to up steps, the underneath part, designed to enable the worshipers ablutions. Nowadays its all been tidied up, and has a ground floor mainly occupied by a very busy Restaurant ( especially at lunch time ) and the upper storey converted into small retail outlets, run by artisans of every description. We bought some nice souvenirs there, glad to know that the money was going straight into the pockets of the craftspeople and not large businesses. We enjoyed a pleasant couple of hours there and would recommend anyone in Nicosia to put it as their No1 lunch and souvenir stop",Buyuk Han
50,"The Buyuk Han embraces you with history and even today serves it's original purpose. Built to advance commerce, even today is a must see in Nicosia. It serves as a relic of the past that still like a grandma's comfortable home with biscuits in the oven. The restaurant is satisfactory and the wares are geared to tourists but one can still envision camels entering the gates. The architecture has welcomed visitors for hundreds of years and like grandma welcomes the travelers. I recommend a visit.",Buyuk Han
40,"I've been here a few times -- always on a weekend (when they're full). It's an amazing building, the atmosphere is great. The food is very good. Service is below average -- they are understaffed, and so it takes ages to order and generally get a hold of the waiters. Another minus is the fact that there is no public free toilet (you need to pay, even if you are a customer, and you ned to have exact change even)! Verdict: service needs to be improved, but I am still going back.",Buyuk Han
50,"I am mesmerised as to why this is no 7 on this site as this location is situated in the Turkish side, therefore you have to pass passport security (the Cypriot and then the queue for Turkish security).We were unfortunate to have a rather large group in front of us, therefore everything was delayed, however afterwards we walked the streets packed with fake designer items (Gucci, Valentino, Sophia Webster etc) and reached Buyuk Han.The building really stands the test of time and nowadays houses shops, travel agents, restaurants as it is spread over 2 floors.A great location int the middle of everything and not far from Selimiye Mosque.",Buyuk Han
50,"Visited on Sunday, even some shops are still open, in general it’s quiet. Good view from history building, take a look, quite unique to see.",Buyuk Han
40,"A typical caravanserai, which has become heavily commercialised with many gift shops. You do get a true feel of how the Turkish Cypriot side is like and this part is quite reminiscent of parts of Turkey. Nice place to hang out if looking for souvenirs and cover from the sun.",Buyuk Han
40,"Büyük Han (The Great Inn) is in the Turkish part of Nicosia. It's very interesting, and here you can find several shops selling typical products. Shopkeepers are very friendly, and it's great to sit here in the shade with an iced cold drink!",Buyuk Han
50,Love this old place beer is always ice cold people friendly and you can pick up real local crafted items to take back. Reasonable prices to.,Buyuk Han
50,Again part of our self guided tour . Very intresting and a wonder place to just stop and have a meal or drink and watch the world bussle by,Buyuk Han
40,It was a lovely shopping center in Lefkosa.only Traditional handmade works were being sold. The famous one was LEFKARA works.,Buyuk Han
50,People were friendly and well the food was specially good. Honest and happy to wait on our table . There is plenty of history in this square and our guide was so proud of their history. Ok shopping if you know what you are for looking for and some better shops with imported leather goods from China reasonable price copies. around the corner.,Buyuk Han
30,Interesting how they have converted this however much better food and drink in side streets which have less huge tourist groups,Buyuk Han
40,"You should visit this when crossing the city on Ledra street. It has a nice market feel and architecture, but we did not feel safe due to some locals stalking us.",Buyuk Han
40,It is a well preseved building which has the typical characteristics of a Han. The shops in it worth having a look as most of them has local stuff. Then after you can eat or have a drink at the cafes on the ground floor.,Buyuk Han
40,"Historic place lots of arts and crafts, to see, ideally not on a Sunday as many places are closed. Restaurant facility",Buyuk Han
40,Fine 450 yrs old caravanserai complete with ablutions fountain and prayer room. Good artisan workshops and restaurants are found here as well.,Buyuk Han
40,"We visited this location as part of a general walk around Nicosia. The Buyuk Han is in the occupied northern side of Nicosia and has been very well restored and is now a craft centre with craft workers and shops on two levels. You are able to look in the back workrooms and see crafters working looms, embroidering, engraving, lace tatting, mosaic making etc and then purchase items from the shops themselves. There is a restaurant in the centre although we had already eaten so can't vouch for the food although it looked good. Worth a visit",Buyuk Han
50,"We had lunch here after wandering around the streets of Turkish Nicosia. Plenty of activity around us - shops and stalls and various people, tourists and locals, as well as the usual numbers of cats, to watch as we waited for our meal. We had kebabs and meat balls which were very nice, helped by eating in such a historic venue.",Buyuk Han
40,"We visited the caravanserai in Nicosia as part of our Cyprus tour. I learned something about the function of such stopping places, the activities carried out, and the allocation of space to people and animals. There did not seem to be much explanatory material for the non-guided tourist. We did not bother with the souvenir shops and food places.",Buyuk Han
40,"A short walk from the Ledra Street crossing point the Buyuk Han Cultural Centre was a nice place to visit in North. If you go with high hopes of a cultural centre you may be disappointed, if you are looking for a well restored historic building with a range of cafes and crafty shops then this is the place for you. The cafes are on the ground floor and the first floor has shops with various crafts on sale along side a helping of the usual tourist fayre. Our guide gave us a brief history explaining it had been used as an inn and a prison in its past incarnations. Free to enter it was well worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
50,One of the first markets in Nicosia is worth of visit. Like You are back in time. There are still some crafters there.,Buyuk Han
50,We followed the crowds of tour parties and found this place. Beautiful old building with lots of little independent producers. Lovely handicrafts to buy. There is a toilet but you need a 50 cent coin to use it.,Buyuk Han
50,"This is a local craft market in a old market square. There are lots of stalls selling lots of home made stuff, not the usual fakes and rubbish you normally get in a Turkish market.Also there are some nice clean toilets which is very useful. They are 50 cents though and don't take anything else except 1 Turkish lira",Buyuk Han
40,"A delightful little tourist spot where you can mix food with tourist shopping. Easily accessible for walkers, those in wheel chair will find it a little frustrating as the majority of craft shops are on the 1st floor and I did not notice a lift.",Buyuk Han
40,Very pleasant site with restaurants and cafes plus some (touristy) arts and crafts shops. Easy to find following the blue line in the pavement which takes you on a succinct tour of sites on the Turkish side of Nicosia. Good place for a pit stop in a historic and well preserved site.,Buyuk Han
40,Atmospheric area of Nicosia with crafts on sale upstairs and a good feeling of an old caravanserai all around. A must-see part of the Turkish side of the city.,Buyuk Han
50,"This old Ottoman market place and accomodation facility is build in the same form and design as the one in Bursa Turkey, as well as the ones in Ediner and Istanbul. The structure have been preserved very well, now holding shops and restaurants for tourists during their breaks while touring of the city. Absolutely fasinating.",Buyuk Han
30,"Beautiful old building, but to say it was a market for arts and crafts is really stretching it. It was mostly full of tat.",Buyuk Han
50,Had an easy crossing by foot from the Ledra Street crossing. Both the Greek and Turkish border security were extremely nice sociable and helpful. All that was required was to have a valid passport. There was no cost or visa required. We spent 2 to 3 hours walking around and had lunch in the square BUYUK HANwhere you'll find a good selection of shops and a few cafes. Recommended for a stop and a lovely place to relaxMike CollinsPafos,Buyuk Han
30,"Quick trip into northern Nicosia. Lovely Han, easy to picture it as an inn of c67 rooms. Well restored, peaceful spot. Climb the steps of the central building to see an even more peaceful room.",Buyuk Han
50,"Enjoyed time shopping the small market shops for hand made items. Prices very reasonable, very friendly people. Great place to sit with friends and enjoy coffee.",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is a well preserved and impressive architectural example of a caravan serail, which were used as inns and trading posts. It was built by the Ottomans in 1572.The quadrangle has two floors surrounding a large courtyard with, at its centre, a small round mosque with a fountain for the 5 daily pre-prayers ablutions. The promenade of the 2 floors are collonaded and topped with picturesque arches. The courtyard level was used for trade and commerce and the upper floor to accommodate the merchants at night.It is now a centre for local Cypriot handicrafts, gift shops and some art galleries.There are a couple of very good restaurants in the courtyard, and plenty of tourists strolling around.This is a much better use of handsome architecture than its British use as The Central Prison of Nicosia from the late 19th C. to the early 20th century..Well worth a visit, a delicious fresh lemonade, a meal. Lovely and lively atmosphere.",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han - (The Great Inn) is an Ottoman built and well preserved old inn where the villagers coming from distant villages used to spend a night or two in Nicosia.The rectangular building has two floors with rooms which are used now as souvenir shops, cafes and restaurants, and the large courtyard which was used to accomodate the animals of the visitors is now used as a relaxing place for the visitors and as an open air restaurant and cafe.Athe the restaurant you can taste the local delicacies of Cyprus prepared and cooked at the location on your order.If you ever come to Nicosia this is a MUST SEE place. Make sure you do not miss it.",Buyuk Han
40,"A historic place which photos could be taken. There are a lot gift shops side by side, if your lucky the owners would be at their store. There are places to eat downstairs and it is close to the historic mosque.",Buyuk Han
50,"A construction that was used to host travelers in the XDC century!Beautiful construction.Today there are restaurants, cafterias and souvernir shops, with Turkish handcraft products.",Buyuk Han
50,"Beautiful. Full of culture, architecture, history. loved it here, such a traditional atmosphere. i would recommend visiting!",Buyuk Han
40,"Historic place with restaurants and local artisans plus some Chinese merchandise shops. Coffee and food are good, atmosphere is pleasant, people are helpful and nice. Overall a place to visit in the Turkish part of Nicosia. You can pay everywhere with euro, Turkish Lira and US dollars.",Buyuk Han
30,A historical place to visit/shops/gallery/restaurant. Good traditional plates and snacks. Try “koupa” or “lahmajoun” and don’t leave the place without trying their homemade lemonade. The only disadvantage is that is a busy place with a lot of tourists.,Buyuk Han
40,It’s nothing really special it truly has a great Turkish vibe. The food is really good in the restaurants and it’s a good place to get some rest during a trip in Nicosia.,Buyuk Han
40,Old bazaar... Not very well preserved... All cafes and restaurants should be removed... İnstead art galleries should be placed..,Buyuk Han
40,It is like an old market square in Europe or Plaza Mayor in Spain but in turkish style.Food is excelent and prices are moderate.,Buyuk Han
40,very nice old building (1572) with a lot of restaurants.inside a little mosque.you have to stop on this spot.,Buyuk Han
40,"This is my favourite lunch destination when working in Nicosia. It is located inside the old walled town and itself is a large four sided building surrounding a large picturesque courtyard. It has had various uses in its history including as a caravanserai and a prison. It has been nicely restored while retaining real character. Good Turkish Cypriot food is available at the restaurant in the courtyard with tables partly in the open and partly under the walled collonades.Food is good, I would recommend the Turkish meatballs and the savoury and sweet filled pancakes.",Buyuk Han
50,"A hidden gem and must visit when in the Capital. Hidden inside the market it is full of small traditional shops selling cyprus souvenirs and artifacts, with few cafes and restaurants it a place to spend your afternoon or enjoy the view with a coffee or lunch.",Buyuk Han
50,Inreresting Turkish monument full of history and surprisingly friendly salesfolk. We bought some scarfs from Omar on the North exit of the Han he also makes pyroengravings that are also nice and traditional. They (scarfs) are incredibly well made.Also there is soap and spices (on the first floor). Going through the Ledra crossing is an interesting experience like walking between two different worlds.,Buyuk Han
30,"Just across the Ledra street crossing, this building with courtyard has s a few restaurants and art stores. Not world class but worth a stop if you cross for the day",Buyuk Han
50,"This is definitely a place to visit if reaching to Nicosia.It's a mix of traditional architecture, with a bit of cultural experience (local artists selling their goods (paintings, souvenirs, jewelry) and a nice restaurant with a shady terrace, perfect place for cooling down). Be aware using the toilet requires a small fee.",Buyuk Han
40,"We did not stay long but entering this building infuses your senses with a mix of wonder and intrigue.This place possesses atmosphere, with throngs of crowds and commercial vendors lining up its premises. However, the real attraction is the architecture of the building and its historical developments. There are posters at the entrance to read - these deserve to be known (or heard if you are with a guide).",Buyuk Han
30,"To be found in the Northern part of the city, close to the crossing checkpoint. Nice ottoman architecture, just serving as a tourist marketplace. Not spectacular but having in mind that the city is not particularly interesting...must see.",Buyuk Han
50,Nice little craft shops that look like they were the living quarters on both floors surrounding this walled square. A nice cafe within the walls for a bite to eat and a drink. I visit every time i am in Cyprus.,Buyuk Han
50,"This is a cute little building in Nicosia. Originally built as an in for muslim travellers. The Buyuk Han is built over 2 floors with rooms used for dwelling and a central courtyard. There's a hexagonal building in the centre of the courtyard which I'd never had guess was a mosque on the upper floor.Now the Buyuk Han houses shops, cafes, restaurants and arts and crafts. It's a cute little building and very good for photos.",Buyuk Han
40,"Some what commercialised but worth having a look if in that part of Turkish Nicosia. However, we missed it at first as we were following the tourist blind line and the restored ""resting place "" is not directly on it. You must also visit is slightly younger and smaller version just across the way.",Buyuk Han
50,"You will find a lot of art work here and if you ask people how they are made, they will tell The building is beautifully restored and you can go in for free.",Buyuk Han
50,"A really beautiful galleried courtyard with an attractive miniature mosque in the centre. A restaurant, cafe and craft shops fill the space - though it's time Turkish Cyprus took a leaf out of its northern neighbour for the quality of the artefacts. Very well worth visiting, even if that involves crossing from the south.",Buyuk Han
40,"This lovely former caravanserai has been restored and converted into many small shops and restaurants to attract tourists.Some nice goods, some junk. Use your judgement. Prices are fair.Small ablution fountain and place to pray in the center.",Buyuk Han
50,"Having crossed the border we had heard the Buyuk Han was worth seeing. It certainly was. Although it was early December there were plenty of people around and all the shops were open on the upper floor displaying their wares including wood crafts, pottery, lace and jewellery. The square is atmospheric and a very pleasant place to spend a quiet hour strolling or sitting with a drink. It also has clean toilets which you can access for half a euro.",Buyuk Han
40,Stunning experience of shopping and eating inside this well maintained historical structure. Pretty shops and a crisp winter sunshine completes the picture,Buyuk Han
40,"Any trip across into northern Nicosia should include a visit to the Buyuk Han. There is always something new or different to see, be it exhibits in the gallery stalls or, alternatively, a group of professional musicians providing gentle background music by which to enjoy a refreshing beer or coffee.There are many eating and drinking options here as well as many examples of historical events.Once refreshed one can move on to admire the cathedral/mosque and indoor market.",Buyuk Han
40,"There are a bunch of craft shops on the 2nd floor, with a restaurant in the center that serves some decent food.",Buyuk Han
40,This is quite an historic building. Over 400 years old it has been a prison under the British as well as a inn way back in the day. There a number of small artisan shops there and it is a cool place to stop in after you have crossed over the checkpoint to the north side. On the bottom floor you can get refreshments.,Buyuk Han
40,"The Buyuk Han, or 'Big Inn' is a very attractive enclosed square with an ornate central tower. The interior edge of the square hosts small restaurants, bars and craft shops, and there's a balcony floor with more of the same. This is a great place to stop for a while, maybe have a drink or some lunch when exploring the old part of North Nicosia.",Buyuk Han
50,Worth visiting when you are in north Nicosia. The building was originally the great inn and has been restored and accommodates cafes and craft shops & workshops. There are some good items on sale hand made by the stallholders at reasonable prices.,Buyuk Han
50,"Essentially a 400 year plus old hotel built by the Ottomans after their conquest of Nicosia, the Buyuk Han today is shopping and dining experience. The shops are mostly artisans with interesting hand made items. We found an ceramic artist on the second floor and brought some of her work back home. There was live music while we milling about. There is a section that shows the state the Han was in prior to the renovation. Great stop for a drink or lunch.",Buyuk Han
50,"Visited this old caravanserai during an afternoon in the Turkish part of Nicosia. Not our first visit, but happy to come again. A lovingly restored site that now houses small and individual craft shops.",Buyuk Han
40,"We host alot of friends and visitors to Cyprus and we always make it a point to visit the Buyuk Han, as it shows the importance of commerce centuries ago. It now also has a nice restaurant and purveyors of handmade goods. I really enjoy my time every time I go. Around the corner (heading south) are an amazing collection of shops.",Buyuk Han
50,"A very well preserved and renovated 16th Century Ottoman inn/trading complex, It is a beautiful and atmospheric place to visit, with a number of mainly craft shops and cafes currently occupying the interior. It appeals to historians (a very special place) and non-historians too. Allow 30-60 minutes, plus cafe time if desired.",Buyuk Han
50,"Very nice place inmidst of rather crowded streets, luckily not very obvious and well hidden. Very nicely renovated building, artists stores and restaurants to have a rest and a coffee.",Buyuk Han
40,"Loads of local crafts shops to wander around. Many of the shopkeepers are sitting making the products in the shops, particularly on the upper floor. Due to the stone construction and arcades, it stays cool even in the midday sun.",Buyuk Han
50,"Came across Buyak Han on a trip across the border a While ago, and having told others of our experience, have received great comments back.Surrounded by a wall and bustling with tourist, locals and waiters, its a great place to chill and have an excellent meal in many of the welcoming eating places.The apmosphere is unique in this area and just love the place.Prices are competitive to. Enjoy!",Buyuk Han
40,"On a hot sunny day this was an ideal place to stop for lunch or a drink at one of the cafes, either inside or under umbrellas, to watch the world go by. The courtyard is beautiful and surrounded by craft type stalls and cafes. The ladies in the area have got together , from all religions, to crochet coloured decorations for the handrails etc - to symbolise peaceful living together - quite touching. This feels like being in another era. Delightful.",Buyuk Han
30,A nice open air court yard with shops around and i think 2 restuarnt corners .We tried the one restaurant but the food is not recomended there try other restaurants outside. I did not find the shops of much interest just souvenirs etc,Buyuk Han
40,"I was staying on the other side but went there for breakfast and coffee. It was good to see what the town was like... Buyuk Han itself was popular with tourists, and just after we ordered our breakfast, a big group of school children turned up and a chaos pursued... all in a good spirit. We had some sort of flat grilled bread with filling with tea. It feels like a dream now.",Buyuk Han
40,"historical site for trading, now an area of small shops and cafes. lots of character, and well worth a visit. very relaxing place in the sunshine.",Buyuk Han
50,"Büyük Han (The Great Inn) is a must to see for Nicosia travelers as it carries the historical legacy of Cyprus to the present day. You can find nice souvenir shops, traditional handicrafts and can refresh with food and drinks. The cafes serve big portions but they are usually slow so it's one negative point but the surrounding somehow makes it easy to oversee this.",Buyuk Han
40,"We liked this because we felt we had just walked into a different culture. It originally was a place for traders to stay and store goods, but now is lots of (tiny) shops, mostly for handmade things, often still being made on the balcony or in the shop as you wander about. the architecture and enclosed square make it feel very (middle)eastern. We wandered through for at least half an hour and spent some time just sitting and enjoying being there.",Buyuk Han
30,Walking around on the turkish side is recommended when in Nicosia. Much calmer and the sites are well renovated and worth a visit.,Buyuk Han
50,"If you're at all interested in historic caravanserais this is one of the most intriguing you'll find, repurposed for modern-day uses. It oozes charm and is perfectly located in the old part of Nicosia on the Turkish side so you can easily walk to it from Ledra Street crossing.",Buyuk Han
40,Lovely displays of local art and crafts. Great architecture and beautiful courtyard in the center of the old city.,Buyuk Han
50,We were in the North and had crossed over at Ledra Street. We felt a bit of culture was required and so we checked out the Buyuk Han. Beautiful and positioned in a lovely ancient old Courtyard. You can close your eyes and imagine the place when it was in all its glory. Good piece of History and very important to boot. If you venture this way then The Buyuk Han is a must.,Buyuk Han
50,"Originally built by the Ottomans in 1572, the year after they had seized Cyprus from the Venetians. In the centre of the open market and running water.There is a large inner courtyard which is surrounded by the rooms that have colonnades with cross vaults in front. There are 68 rooms in both floors, with the ones at the ground floor being historically used for commerce and the ones at the first floor historically used for accommodation. There are also 10 one-storey shops behind the colonnade at the eastern entrance.There are many gift shops and places to eat here now. It has a wonderful laid back atmosphere which drifts you back to an exotic middle eastern vibe. A wonderful place to have a meal and people watch.",Buyuk Han
40,Worth to go place if you want to buy some souvenirs and other staff that prepared by craftsmen. Nice small place,Buyuk Han
40,Very beautiful building cull of craft stalls and a cafe. Worth a walk around whilst here as the architecture of the building is beautiful.,Buyuk Han
40,If you stroll around the city this is a place to goFrom outside it seems like a private building while after passing the door you enter in a situation back in the yearsSmall shops of craftsmen are waiting for uA place to visit,Buyuk Han
50,One of the best thing to do in north Cyprus as you go into buyuk han you feel like going back to centuries.,Buyuk Han
40,This is a typical Turkish place with a few restaurants and many small shops. Beautiful architecture and a friendly atmosphere.,Buyuk Han
30,It houses a number of creative businesses- done with very commercial offerings. They don’t like to haggle unfortunately.A lot of Turkish memorabilia is available. It’s a really beautiful little square and easy to find.,Buyuk Han
30,"It's nothing special really, you can live without visiting this. No historical value and full of restaurants/cafes nowadays.",Buyuk Han
40,"This is well worth a visit ""The Big inn"" as apposed to the big yin! Two floors incorporating lodgings in days gone by. Souvenirs on sale as well as refreshments. An antique Travelodge reincarnated as a tourist attraction not unlike the caravanserai in Kusadasi that we visited .",Buyuk Han
50,This is one of my favourite places for breakfast or lunch in the old city of Lefkosa (Nicosia). The traditional boreks are the best in the island.,Buyuk Han
50,"I recommend to read the history about this place before you visit. You can see every detail of what history tells you about it. We had a nice traditional breakfast in a peaceful inner garden with a mellow live music. I recommend to everyone to come here at the weekend apparently every Saturday, for a breakfast or a cup of tea or a cup of Turkish coffee. My recommendation is to ignore the political reviewers.",Buyuk Han
50,Staying in Nicosia it was worth a little trip through the border and to have a browse around the Buyuk Han. It makes for a great film set I would say with some interesting little shops and stalls and a good place to stop have a coffee and people-watch.,Buyuk Han
10,Nothing to show as the place has no historical value and not related to the Ancient Greek monuments of Cyprus,Buyuk Han
40,"Peaceful, with great teas. Lots of history to digest and a great place for a break during your walking tour of the old city.",Buyuk Han
40,Original experience. Clean. Good oils and good masseuse. Naturally cooled place insulated from extreme heat and extreme cold,Buyuk Han
30,"Buyuk Han is an interesting place rebuilt into a small market place and courtyard restaurants. The intensive repairs are detailed around the covered archways on photographs which is very interesting. I ate at the largest restaurant and the food was good and service very good. Lots of small stalls selling local products are available, ideal for gifts.",Buyuk Han
40,Nice place for buy some typical artisan items. It's nice for a walk and take a tea in the centre of the building.,Buyuk Han
50,This is a very classy looking building set in the centre of a beautiful little square that has wonderful verandas all the way around the square from which great photos can be taken as well as on ground level. A must see!,Buyuk Han
50,Great little spot after the border crossing.Nice little cafe with cheap beer and wine and lots of little craft shops to wander round.,Buyuk Han
40,"Must visit in Nicosia / Lefkoşa. Lot of small shops with souvenirs and few restaurants inside. Don't pay with euro, because cheaper is if you pay with Turkish lira",Buyuk Han
30,Well preserved historical place. Inside you could find several small shops and a restaurant. The restaurant food is not so good but the shops are nice to be visited.,Buyuk Han
50,"I've been here many times over the years to take visiting friends and it never fails to delight. Pretty, lots of shoplets and cheap and cheerful local food in the restaurant in the corner. No doubt I will be back",Buyuk Han
40,"Beautiful caravanserrai in Nicosia, just stay away from the mediocre restaurant and overpriced shops. Look, enjoy take pictures and eat somewhere else",Buyuk Han
40,"We revisited here with our children to let them see this fantastic structure in Nicosia. Filled with quaint cafes and shops, it is well worth a visit to while away an hour or so. Touristy souvenir shops coupled with more authentic shops makes for a good wander.",Buyuk Han
50,"Amazing place to visit. The place offers rich historical, cultural experience. Definitely a beautiful architecture showing the old life style. The place has touristic shops and restaurants. Amazing to see some bullet marks on the building as well.Nice to sit and enjoy the courtyard at the coffee shops/restaurants.",Buyuk Han
50,A must see place in the Northern Part of Cyprus. Welcoming a variety of nice handmade work with a beautiful architecture. The place is in the heart of the old city where you could walk and have a decent ethnic meal.,Buyuk Han
50,Excellent historical & cultural attraction point of northern Cyprus. You can smell the history in this great Han.,Buyuk Han
50,I have visited the Buyuk Han several times. It was a travellers inn and has been renovated and restored to a high standard with many quaint touristic craft shops and coffee shops. Found inbthe middle of Lefkosa walked city amongst many other places of interest...it is well worth a visit,Buyuk Han
40,Pleasantly shaded corner of the old city. Reasonable food and upstairs has a good variety of small shops selling handicrafts and souvenirs.Can get a bit crowded when the occasional bus load descends....,Buyuk Han
50,"The khan offers a great view into the past. You can imagine the horses and camels at ground floor and residencies above. Nice ambiance, in small lack of maintenance and TLC",Buyuk Han
40,"Stroll through this place, visit the little chapel and think yourself back in time. Near the centre of town",Buyuk Han
50,Must-see in old town Nicosia. The shops on the upper floor are unique artisanal workshops. The restaurant Sedirhan inside the Great Inn is a good recommendation for lunch and refreshment,Buyuk Han
40,Must visited is a historical landmark a many restaurant and coffee inside and near the great cathedral previously and now switched to a mosque,Buyuk Han
50,"Around the streets of this, you'd think your somewhere completely different, but once you step inside the Buyuk Han, it is like being in an authentic Turkish setting. There are good souvenir shops with a nice restaurant, which in comparison to the south is cheap. Nice place to be, would come back again.",Buyuk Han
40,"The Buyuk Han has been restored and is home to souvenir shops and cafes. There are also public toilets which accept euro and lira coins and are surprisingly clean and well kept. On both levels there are shops whilst the ground floor also contains the cafes. I say cafe as I wouldn't describe them as fine dining or the setting for a romantic date, but the do offer a full range of meals and snacks as well as drinks. The courtyard can be a bit airless but so is the rest of the city and on a hot day, the shade is very welcome. Only a handful of the shops are open on Sunday so if you are looking for purchases, a visit in the week would probably be more suitable.",Buyuk Han
50,"Except the hot weather, it is a very beautiful place with lovely shops of hand made crafts and souvenirs. Also some coffee shops are available in open area. The crochet art are nicely exhibited on chairs and stairs.No cars are allowed inside.",Buyuk Han
30,"just a spot to look for a souvenir to take home, too many people and not enough air to breathe, many shops were closed",Buyuk Han
50,"When we were there (Saturday), there was a bazaar taking place, with all sorts of Turkish shops with clothes, jewellery, scarves, herbs, tea...all very nice. The area inside was also very picturesque, historical, and offered good views of the city from the upper layer. Each little alcove in the upper balcony layer housed one little shop; generally they were quite cheap, and also had very good things of Lefkosia for tourists. Sorry, but a lot better than the shops on the other side of Lefkosia. There were also small cafés, down below, and various events taking place, such as a wedding. Very nice visit. Recommended!",Buyuk Han
40,This is a lovely spot to visit when in Nicosia. Some beautiful well maintained architecture and some unusual and individual little shops with handmade crafts. Worth a visit.,Buyuk Han

40,"It is a place you can relax, a place where you can recollect and a place where you can get in, close your eyes and here the voices of the past when Cyprus was one. You can get Turkish/Cypriot coffee and find some ekmek kataif! Enjoy",Buyuk Han
50,"It is well worth a visit! Beautiful old building, now filled with souvenir and touristy shops, with friendly shopkeepers and storeowners. Go there and get lost in the history of the place. And don't forget to have a sneaky look into the tiny mosque in the middle, climb the steps and look at the serenity. I loved this place!",Buyuk Han
40,A wonderful little courtyard giving you a brief look at the original setting of the old city. There's food to eat and shops to nose around; definitely worth a visit if exploring Nicosia north of the border.,Buyuk Han
40,"The Buyuk Han was built by the Ottoman Turks in the late 16th century, and is the largest caravanserai in Cyprus. At the centre is a small mosque, with a fountain for worshippers to wash themselves before prayer. Originally it was a defensive inn for travellers, with an inner courtyard and stabling for pack animals. Under the British administration during the late 19th century, it was a prison, which later reverted to an inn and refuge for poorer travellers.Nowadays the Buyuk Han is an interesting area, containing shops and restaurants, and a good place to get out of the sun and relax.",Buyuk Han
50,"Visited here as part of an excursion , lovely place steeped in history , lunch was included here, and very nice , the upper level is packed with small stalls etc selling all kinds of trinkets, crafts and antiques, but no one is pushy , you can browse at leisure ,A must see on a visit to Nicosia",Buyuk Han
40,An interesting place to visit when in Nothern Nicosia. Shops in the upper-level selling mainly handcrafted items. Restaurants and cafe in the lower level for a quiet drink or to enjoy Turkish food.,Buyuk Han
50,"You will find the Buyuk Han through a small market street on the lane leading to the old Nicosia cathedral which now after the war has become a mosque, turn left half way down and you enter another world, even on a hot day in the upper 30's the place cools you down. Take the stairs to the upper floor small shopping area and see all the local hand made crafts, it really is like visiting the Middle East,",Buyuk Han
40,Nice quiet place full of history. Now has shops and cafes/restaurants on both levels. Has notice boards explaining the renovations that have been tastefully done.,Buyuk Han
30,"Refurbished Ottoman Inn, similar to a caravansera. Restaurants and craft shops. Different things though, local silk work",Buyuk Han
40,"Easily accessible with lots of history behind the building, coupled with vendors selling local crafts. Visit some of the other sites around the Buyuk Han to get a comprehensive picture of the history of the city.",Buyuk Han
50,"A beautiful place in the center of Nicossia, to visit, to drink coffee and to eat some food, Also you can find old books, souvenir, traditional stuff. So it gives you what you expect from a carvansarai, even it is almost 500 years old. Even in the hottest days, it is cooler inside and it is very close the good restaurants, like Sabır or Bereken fırın",Buyuk Han
50,This is well worth a visit. Very interesting history but now also full of arts and crafts and a place for quiet refreshment,Buyuk Han
40,Visited this beautiful historical area of Lefkosa. Building very interesting with lots of information regarding the local history. Had a lovely lunch and also a good shopping experience well worth a visit.,Buyuk Han
50,"Wonderful historical building, perfect for wandering around. Lovely handmade gifts available from the numerous shops around the square. Sadly many were closed when we visited and no one was sure why. But all in all a lovely place to visit. Great to see a multi-cultural yarn bombing too.",Buyuk Han
50,"A superb building crafted for the travellers of yesteryear. As an INN/karavansaray it provided ancient travellers with accommodation including provision for their Horses and Camels.Unfortunately on my latest trip it was a Sunday and in Cyprus Sunday is a dead day, and a true Sabbath where very little happens and as such almost all the Shops and Craft Centres housed in the Inn were closed as well as the coffee shops - so choose your day to visit carefully....................",Buyuk Han
40,This is an old beautiful structure. The lay out and how it's been maintained allows for easy access around the building. Didn't spend much time here but it was worth the walk through.,Buyuk Han
40,It's the best place to get souvenirs from the Turkish side. You can try mehmet's coffee in the cafe. It dates back to Ottoman times.,Buyuk Han
50,Really good food. Great staff. And the walled fort is amazing a short walk from the Nicosia crossing. Been here many times. Definitely recommend a visit.,Buyuk Han
50,"It was love to have coffee and enjoy traditional environment, it is a beautiful place with variety of stalls and coffee shops",Buyuk Han
40,"This caravanserai is a fine example of the resting places of merchant traders, and their camels (ships of the desert). It dwarfs the nearby Kumarcilar Han on Asmaalti Square, leading it to be referred to as the Great Inn, much favoured by Alanya trades people. It is very busy, and has much to admire including the bathhouse, in its centre, to facilitate pre-prayer ablutions.",Buyuk Han
40,The atmosphere of the surroundings was to me spoilt by the advertising umbrellas and shops. Otherwise it was good.,Buyuk Han
50,"You cannot miss it from the streets of Turkish Nicosia. It's very close to the Selimiye Mosque. A very nice building with many small shops where you can buy your souvernirs from. We were lucky as we crossed a guide as well explaining things to a group and we found out things about the Han as well. Very pretty architecture and many handmade, local things to see.",Buyuk Han
40,"Nice location,many nice things to see in the second floor shops area,nice food. Good place for art lovers and souvenirs purchases. You can pay in euro. Is in Turkish side of Nicosia. Make sure ur waiter will bring u exactly what u asked,do ask for salt they won't think to bring u",Buyuk Han
50,You have to cross the border at the end of Lidras street in the Cyprus part .Have your passport because the turks will register you.Not the Cyprus side.After passing the border to the right about 500 meters you will see the han. When we visited it had an open artists market including of course restaurants.It has a big court yard and at the first floor are the shops.Very pleasant stroll.,Buyuk Han
40,"This ancient 16C Ottoman 'caravanseri' would be of great interest to history enthusiasts but it would also be of interest to all those 'general' tourists who just like to wander around old places, have a coffee or a meal and do a bit of shopping - all available here! This also used be an old prison but the cells have been converted into art galleries, shops, crafts etc - so lots of retail therapy also available!",Buyuk Han
50,"Many small shops, and a cafe as well. Historic old building has great appeal. Very close to the ""border"" crossing.",Buyuk Han
40,"A little bit of history that is worth checking out. Yes, its a tourist trap. But once you get over that fact, this is a nice place to check out, enjoy a meal and shop for some souvenirs. Go check it out!",Buyuk Han
30,Interesting place to visit and some great photo opportunities. Definitely a tourist trap now with a number of organised tours converging hear including Thomson and first choice.Toilets are available on site but cost 3 Turkish or 50 cent (euro) to access. They don't look like much from the outside but are really clean and well maintained inside.Number of gift shops selling tat but nothing really for north Cyprus specifically.,Buyuk Han
50,"It has lots of little shops that have tourists as their target market, so there's a lot that one might wish to avoid purchasing. That being said, there is a very decent little shop on the upper floor where it's possible to purchase things like handmade soaps and teas; I tend to go there to buy apple tea (the real kind, not the powder). The building itself is also truly beautiful. As an aside, someone has recently yarn bombed the place.",Buyuk Han
40,A must see in the northern part of Nicosia. This impressive example of Ottoman architecture now houses cafes and craft shops around the courtyard. Great for grabbing a bite to eat or a drink and soaking up the atmosphere.,Buyuk Han
50,Crossed into northern Nicosia (Turkish side) with both exit and entrance border controls. Had lunch at the Byuk Han or Great Inn.,Buyuk Han
40,"Interesting history to this old inn, take time to wander round the craft stalls before taking a shady seat to enjoy a cooling drink or light lunch.The needlework display and the stories behind them are of particular interest.",Buyuk Han
50,It is probably one of the most unique point of visits in Nicosia I think this place must be seen once you travel to Nicosia. You can enjoy some local food and you can get good-price souvenirs,Buyuk Han
40,"Intersting old inn built by the Ottoman Empire, tastefully converted into a small shopping area with a couple of cafes. Photos on the wall show the restoration of the Buyuk Han from it's almost destroyed state. One thing that was particularly striking here is the colourful needle work which lays over the benches, handrails and pillars etc... These are made by a group of Greek and Turkish Cypriots who wanted to created a visual symbol of peace between the Turkish and Greek Cypriot regions of the island, and the desire for a reunified Cypriot country. A clear indication of the sentiment of the people on the ground.You won't spend all day here, but it's good for a bite to eat and to enjoy the Ottoman architecture of the building, well worth a visit if you are near by.",Buyuk Han
50,This is a lovely place to sit and enjoy life. A lovely old caravanserai full of history. Friendly people. Definitely worth a visit.,Buyuk Han
40,for me it was an interesting historical place. now it is a nice place to eat. You can enjoy traditional (Turkish or Greek) cypriot dishes,Buyuk Han
50,If you cross over into Northern Cyprus then this is a must. Very peaceful bohemian place with cafes and craft shops not far from Ledra St crossing.,Buyuk Han
50,"Crossed the green line to visit as I was curious. Such a lovely area in amongst the chaos of Turkish occupied Cyprus. It's peaceful, calm atmosphere is to be enjoyed. We took lots of photos as the architecture is beautiful. There's small ' shops' to buy handicrafts plus an area for antique type goods. They sell some 'tat' fridge magnets etc but overall it's a nice place to see. The coffee, the food, esp halloumi cheese pastries are delicious. There's a choice of food and it's nice to just sit and enjoy people watching.",Buyuk Han
50,"If you are touring Northern Cyprus make a point of visiting the historically significant Buyuk Han in Nicosia.This impressive two story ancient building is the largest caravansarai on Cyprus and is considered to be one of the finest buildings on the island. It has served many different purposes in it's lifetime and in it's current form it offers shops and restaurants, and within the open courtyard there's a small mosque with a fountain for pre-prayer ablutions.Take time to enjoy some refreshments and the pleasant environment within the courtyard.There are toilets within the courtyard however there is a charge for using them.",Buyuk Han

50,"Around the square there are plenty of local handicrafts shops on lower and upper levels, some restaurants and cafes. Really nice place to visit, and to while away an hour or two. It's an old public house from the Ottoman Empire.",Buyuk Han
30,"Old resting house of the Ottoman empire located very close to the Ledra street crossing point. Old fashioned,and friendly cafe which takes you back to 1820...or even more",Buyuk Han
50,You have to visit this place!!!And eat some of the food. Too good! The Turkish meat ravioli was excellent.,Buyuk Han
50,If you are in Lefkoşa a definite must see. Visit yhe shop selling authentic stuff and sip your Turkish coffee in there before you live.,Buyuk Han

50,Lots of little shops in and around a courtyard and first floor walkway.Lots of local handcrafts made by the locals.Just out side the main entrance is a square with a few cafes.Nice place to have a drink and lunch and watch the tourist go by.,Buyuk Han
50,"From the outside it offers a glimpse into Nicosia of 500 years ago and more, but inside, oh wow. Little cafes, quaint shops and galleries, this is wonderful",Buyuk Han
30,"Guess it is must visit place in the occupied part of Nicosia, not a bad place to have lunch, however food is not that great as one might expect. I have personally tasted much better Turkish cuisine.",Buyuk Han
50,The Han is a term used in the east for road hotelsThey used to have high external walls with no windows and a huge open space inside with all rooms opening to the internal area.This Han is no exception but it has been transformed in sort of a mall (shopping center) for tourist.It is an interesting attraction,Buyuk Han
50,"If like photos this is a must, taking a walk around the upper floor are fantastic items of bygone years - waiting to be brought back to life with a photo .Serve really good coffee as well ;)",Buyuk Han
50,"Very Interesting to know more about the Cyprus History, easy access to most of the venue from the Museum",Buyuk Han
40,"The Han is an interesting glimpse into the past of Cyprus, though updated for the 21st century. It's a little bt like a madrassa, with two levels and a courtyard, but it was intended for traveller accommodation. Thus the rooms have been converted to workshops or just shops. It's sometimes hard to see the unique selling points, you get similar artefacts again and again, and not all the rooms were occupied (though we did visit in February, no exactly the height of the tourist season). A fascinating diversion.",Buyuk Han
40,Lots of local craft work for sale with a nice coffee bar or two serving European and Turkish coffee with pastries - and nobody hassles you.,Buyuk Han
50,"Stumbled across this by accident and day I visited the atmosphere was wonderful, full of locals and tourists relaxing and shopping, what a great place to be.",Buyuk Han
40,Originally built as an inn this courtyard now has craft shops on the upper floor and a cafe/restaurant on the ground floor. Worth stopping into to get a feel for the eastern history of Cyprus,Buyuk Han
40,"Old caravenserail very well renoved, it now hosts a large number of small boutiques. Vell located in the old town of North Nicosia. Unfortunately, you will not find there authentic crafts, but lots of souvenirs for tourists, as well as open air cafés and restaurants. Even if you don't want to do some shopping, have a look at the courtyard, the building is very beatiful.",Buyuk Han
30,"A good historical place to see with its water fountain, mosque, and shops. An outdoor restaurant is available to satisfy your hunger or thurst",Buyuk Han
50,I work nearby and visit it regularly. It is a very well conserved historic building that transmit a nice atmosphere. The restaurants in the patio are nice for lunch and the shops upstairs good for souvenirs. It is just a calm place to enjoy a coffee or a lunch under the shade.,Buyuk Han
50,"Excellent place, especially in the evening. I went near sunset and the lighting was great. the area around the place shuts down very quickly after about 6 pm, and the streets abandoned, so know your route back. this is about 10 minutes from the ledras street crossing.",Buyuk Han
40,Found this once we walked through the crossing into the north side. Very lovely with plenty of places to grab some food to take in your surroundings. Had an amazing meal very cheap due to the TL rate currently. Loved sitting people watching in the winter sunshine.,Buyuk Han
50,We stumbled upon it only by chance and I'm glad we did. There are some nice crafts shops and restaurants catering to locals. Great Turkish coffee. The Turkish side of Nicosia is where you go to enjoy the real atmosphere and imagine how the whole city must have looked like.,Buyuk Han
40,"Good to see this well restored ( or as our tour guide said, Restorated) Han. An old resting place fro camel trains. A good range of gift shops and nice little cafes. It was January so would expect it to be busier in mid summer",Buyuk Han
40,Super quaint atmosphere - good place to relax and eat and have a drink in while looking around North (Turkish-occupied part of) Nicosia; food is ok. Trinket stalls around the 'compound'.Worth seeing if you are in Nicosia.,Buyuk Han
50,Nice historic courtyard to shelter in on a wet windy January day. Very close to the Ledra crossing and makes a welcome change from surrounding shops selling copy watches and bags. Get your souvenirs here! It also has toilet facilities!,Buyuk Han
50,An old building that used to be a stopping point for people and their camels to stay in. Now renovated with small traditional cafes and craft shops. Worth visiting.,Buyuk Han
30,Stumbled upon this courtyard by accident. Popular with the locals. Included a display of crochet blankets. The work of Greek & Turkish Cypriot women who have the wisdom to understand that more joins humanity and the political wedges that divided the country were a retrograde development.,Buyuk Han
40,Nicely renovated and presented part of the inner city with cafes and small shops to wander around in without any hassle,Buyuk Han
50,"A restaurant, a cafe and some tacky souvenir shops. But the unique shop is that of Mr Ali's second hand bookshop. Ali speaks six languages and is a charming cultured and knowledgeable gentleman of 73. A bit of Bric a brac too in between 6,000 books.First floor had more shops but I did not climb the stairs. Historic building. Highly recommended.",Buyuk Han
20,"I dont think this is a good place to visit in Nicosia. although the atmosphere is traditional, there is no entertainment there, only few restaurants (poor variety of food).This is a nice place to spend for half an hour or an hour if you sit to eat and absorb the vibe, nevertheless, it has very touristic atmosphere.",Buyuk Han
50,"And old hostel (Han), typical for this part of Europe and Mediterranean. There are restaurants, cafes and craft shops with souvenirs and many handmade stuff. Worths the time.",Buyuk Han
40,"The architecture is worth seeing briefly. We were there in winter, but maybe in the summer the little outdoor cafés are worth a stop too.",Buyuk Han
40,"Amazing architectural work of the Turkish period in Cyprus. The Han was built in stone and marble to provide shelter for travelers from all over. It had 2 stories and over 60 rooms with 2 entrances, East and West and an Ottoman Mesjid in the center of the yard.It has a couple of restaurants and many souvenir and hand crafted goods shops, it is worth the visit as it transports you to another time and culture.",Buyuk Han
50,"What a facinating place (read the history) & with a lovely little eatery in one corner, try the meat pies plenty to share & the rest of the meals are so plentyful & at such a reasonable price. Highly recommended.",Buyuk Han
50,"It was built with Ottoman period accommodation concept; a big inn.Well restored structure. Lefkara handcrafted products, souvenirs shops, cafes and restaurants will give you a good time to spend around 1 hour.",Buyuk Han
40,A very pretty place - redolent of Halifax Piece Market but smaller and of course more exotic. Coffee & crafts are in abundance although we settled down in the cafe outside. Something to tick off your list and genuinely more attractive than the modern Greek side.,Buyuk Han
40,"There is something magical about this place with its old building, souvenir and accessories shops even paintings, I just feel out of this world when I visit this place. If you ever visited their don't hesitate to have ur lunch at that place as well, you won't regret it. The service can be better though.",Buyuk Han
40,Great spot to chill with plenty of craft stores and cafes in beautiful surroundings. Picturesque and a good photo spot.,Buyuk Han

40,Very nice historical building and cultural centre . Lots of small local craft shops and some bistros . A nice oasis between the more 20th century buildings . Very busy with tourists like ourselves .Enjoyed thevisit very much,Buyuk Han
50,The place is good for turists only ! The bistro what is located ther is not good ! The staff dont understand english and the service is verry bad! The food and drinks are not fresh and good,Buyuk Han
50,"Easy to miss this place unless you have a map or guide prompting you to go in. Go through one of the arches and you are in a very pretty square, with genuine craft shops all round the sides on the ground floor and the upper floor. There are restaurants with outside seating and it is all very nice. Lots of tourists but I felt it was like a little oasis and really enjoyed my visit.",Buyuk Han
40,A a particular attraction reminding you of the past. It was nice working through seeing the grandeur of the former Ottoman emperor.Today it is a cultural central and there are also a number of souvenir shops on the ground floor,Buyuk Han
50,The Buyuk Han is just inside the Turkish part of Nicosia and is a very fine building built by the Ottomans in the 16th Century - it is a must see place. Once you have crossed the border it is well signposted and takes you past many of the street vendors and their 'high end handbags'. Once inside the Buyuk Han there is a courtyard and around the edge you will find some great tourist craft stalls around the sides with a mix of quality gifts as well as some tat. There are also places to eat upstairs and on the ground floor. In the centre of the courtyard is a small mosque with a fountain for pre-prayer washing.,Buyuk Han
50,"Nice place to visit just inside the Turkish side and with easy access from the Greek side then good to visit, some nice craft stalls and places to eat, browse around or just spend a few hours just people watching",Buyuk Han
50,"Went across the border to visit, well worth it. Lovely building surrounded by quaint little souvenir shops and a few restaurants.",Buyuk Han
50,"We traveled to Lefkosa by car and managed to find a free place near the Kyrenia gate entrance to the old walls. As you walk along this main route you will soon find yourself at the Bayuk Han as we did and found a bice corner for a rest and a drink. The upper level has some lovely small craft shops and downstairs is mostly bars/cafes. In the middle is a tiny Mosque. It was fully restored in around 1920's, and has been really well done. It was a Caravanserai - where traders would top for a night or two with rooms upstairs and their animals downstairs. Sit back and watch the world go by.",Buyuk Han
40,"This is a heavily touristed location, but it's a convenient place to pick up Turkish style souvenirs (or in my case, real apple tea). There's a restaurant that's a tad expensive but not bad.",Buyuk Han
40,"First of all, you don't have to pay for a trip, you can go there and access everything.No Fees to be paid no nothing.The building just amazing and the stores on the first floor are just to die for. most of the items they sell are handmade.there is a small cafe inside to chill and have a good beverage.",Buyuk Han

30,This Khan is one of the oldest in Cyprus and originally was used as sleeping quarters for travelers and the stables for the horses. But now it has been restored and it has craft shops and a cafe. In the middle of the open square is a small mosque supported on marble pillars with steps up to the entrance.mosque,Buyuk Han
40,"The Buyuk Han is a collection of small shops and cafes clustered around an old Han. The shops are quant with a lot of individual and unique products. Browsing was fine and you didn't feel pressurised by the owners. The cafes were good, we just had a couple of lemonade but the portions in the main cafe looked very generous. Enjoyed this a lot.",Buyuk Han
50,This old ottoman hotel is deffinatly worth a visit. It's very picturesque and it's got a few nice local craft and gift shops located inside. It also had a few nice restaurants that sells traditional Turkish food.,Buyuk Han
50,"A wonderful Karavansaray stumbled upon when looking to waste an hour waiting for a Government Office to open.Truly magnificent Ottoman architecture very reminiscent of the back streets of the Istanbul Grand Bazaar and other Kervansarays spead throughout Turkey, and especially Payas close to Dörtyol and Iskenderun.",Buyuk Han
50,"This is the nicest bit of Turkish architecture on the island - an original caravansarai with colonnades and a tiny mosque in the centre. On the ground floor are some handicraft shops and a good restaurant, called Sedirhan. The upper, colonnaded floor is occupied by dozens of small arts and crafts shops; each with their own speciality. Lunch and an amble around the Buyuk Han's shops is a great way to while away a few peaceful hours, away from the traffic and crowds of N.Nicosia.",Buyuk Han
50,"If you are in North Cyprus this a one if the must-see places. Under the blazing sun, this place is not only excellent for nice food but also to cool down! Try traditional Cypriot food (pastries filled with ricotta cheese is my personal favourite) with a cold glass of beer. Read up the history of the Han! It's a fine example of regenerated historical places!",Buyuk Han
50,The restored caravanserai is now used for cafes and craft shops. The building itself still has great character and features the original chapel in the centre. You can easily imagine the traders of the past arriving here and resting overnight.,Buyuk Han
40,Good place to relax some time !Good shops available to take back some memories !!!Nice restaurant !!!,Buyuk Han
50,"Highly suggested to visit spot. You may purchase traditional hand-made goods, see how these styles are made; visit some traditional painters, handcrafters shops and meet with them; have a meal, drink or Cyprus coffee at the internal garden.",Buyuk Han
50,"Something that amazed me, perhaps because I wasn’t too prepared for it, is that immediately one crosses over the Nicosia boundary line there is a visible and an abrupt change in culture, and this when one is practically in the same Ledra Street. Buyuk Han is definitely a Turkish location just into the occupied zone of Nicosia. Described as a caravanserai, it was a spot of respite for weary travelling parties and is definitely very Ottoman. It consists of a well shaded inner courtyard around which a two floored building with various chambers which either served for accommodation or trade. In the middle of the yard, a domed mosque, which does not dominate the building, but defines it with its down-to-earth beauty. One could just imagine its welcoming function in the days of slow, exasperating transport. Today it is still a beautiful venue to visit, converted into a tourist attraction with craft and souvenir shops all around. There are ample tables where one could either dine or lounge and benches in the shade to take in the congenial environment. A photographic record of the development of Buyuk Han is affixed prominently against a wall, and good mementoes are on sale here too.",Buyuk Han
50,A place where you can sit in a cultural environment and eat traditional pastries while your kids discover the little shops within the Han.,Buyuk Han
50,"This whole old ""inn"" has been very well reconstructed, with the former hotel rooms now mainly occupied by artisans, etc. It is well worth a visit, but unfortunately ma restaurant has been allowed to take up more and more space which completely spoils the whole ""vista"".",Buyuk Han
50,"A nice place to sit and have either a drink or a meal, the history of the place seems to permeate through everything and the trinkets and gifts available reflect this.",Buyuk Han
40,Spend a while wandering around the small shops and sip a cool drink in the cafe. The building is interesting and the restoration work has made it a place to visit. The small shops sell some hand made items and artworks,Buyuk Han
50,The Buyuk Han is located near to the market place and mosque in old Nicosia. It has been sympathetically restored and well worth a visit. There is a coin operated rest room there. There is also information and photographs on the walls giving more information on the Han. The refreshments available are in my average. That said fine for a cup of tea/coffee/cold drink.,Buyuk Han
50,It is quite a quiet and traditional place with tasty food and low prices. The staff is very friendly and always smiley! It's worth paying a visit,Buyuk Han
40,It looks great and gives the impression of a thriving centre. A pleasant place to have a tea or coffee but the good is very average. There are sometimes interesting arty shops open but it is becoming too touristy for my taste.,Buyuk Han
40,Worth a stop by when visiting lefkosa/nicosia.Restored a few years ago theres some nice shops selling hand crafted items inside and the building has some good history from the ottaman period.,Buyuk Han
50,Buyuk Han is one of the most beautiful buildings of Nicosia.Currently it works as an art center where you can visit several workshops. Each room hosts a different branch of art in the yard are many cafes and souvenir shops,Buyuk Han
50,"Really beautiful building in the Turkish part of Nicosia, the local craft stalls upstairs are well worth visiting.",Buyuk Han
40,"it's a nice old building built by the ottomans , it contains many souvenir shops and restaurants , it's a nice place for a break ,to have a drink or to eat.",Buyuk Han
50,As it is one of the biggest Kervansarays that was built during the Ottoman period it is called BUYUK HAN .( Meaning the big Kervansaray in Turkish) There is a water tank in the middle which is just under the Mescit. In the British Colony Period the place was used as an open prison.Later on shelter for poor people.Nowadays its restorated and in use. Today you can buy souvenirs; handcrafts or lace made by local people. The restaurant is amazing with its local food and smiling staff. Highly recommended.,Buyuk Han
40,"Very nice building ,the courtyard houses various cafe/restaurants, various souvenir stalls at both levels!! Not many different souvenirs, but do look at the little pottery magnets filled with various cactui on the top level- really unique!!!",Buyuk Han
40,"This place is really impressing. It is situated in the Turkish part of the town. A few years ago, the buildings are not used for anything. At this moment, everything looks clean and there are some little stores (looks like a market) upstairs on the second floor. The prices in the restaurants are not high at all and you can pay with euro. In the centre there is a little building which is nice for taking a picture.",Buyuk Han
50,"A beautiful and unique place to host the local culture of Cyprus. A variety of food, souvenir shops, local artwork and a must drink Cypriot coffee.You will leave the place smiling, for sure!",Buyuk Han
40,Buyuk Han is a nice little place to stop for a quick half hour browse of authentic craft shops while in the north of the city or longer if you stop for some food or drink. Very easy to find from the Ledra St crossing.,Buyuk Han
50,"Gorgeous old han, much like the ones in Bursa but smaller. Great little artisan shops and good restaurant and Turkish coffee house.",Buyuk Han
50,A beautifully restored building with splashes of Turkish coffee shops and mounds of second hand literature.,Buyuk Han
30,I found this to be the most interesting stop on our trip to Nicosia. It had an interesting story to go along with the historical facts.,Buyuk Han
40,A beautiful courtyard surrounded by interesting shops--many much better than the standard souvenir shops elsewhere in northern Nicosia. The cafe in the courtyard serves delicious Turkish pastries.,Buyuk Han
40,"I'd never been inside a caravanerai (a medieval inn and where they could also house their horses and do their trading) and it's a unique opportunity to do that. That said, the ""wow"" factor is pretty low but it's a nice place to meander around and look at the shops and possibly grab lunch or something to drink in a place with atmosphere.",Buyuk Han
40,"Well, of course you simply must visit the Buyuk Han, the restored ""grand inn"" in North Nicosia.Craft shops, tourist shops, restaurants, cafes - plenty of opportunities to relax from the burdens of travel.No, really, put down your mobile device, slow down, spend some time here ... and talk to people.You may find yourself talking to the Greek-speaking and Turkish-speaking Cypriots and friends who have been meeting for coffee and lunch on Saturdays for over a decade.Sadly, you will no longer be able to visit the enthralling Traditional Cypriot Shadow Puppet Theatre and museum on the second floor. Renowned puppeteer Mr. Mehmet has retired after decades of professional life and years at the Buyuk Han. But you can still see ""Turkish Cypriot Shadow Puppets at the Büyük Han, Nicosia"" on YouTube -- to get a feel of the old Cypriot shadow puppet tradition, that once was very much a part of the Buyuk Han community and history.There is a lot of history to be absorbed at the Buyuk Han. Draw it in - don't just click a few photos and leave.",Buyuk Han
50,"Nicosia, divided city. Though the differences between ""south"" and ""north"" in this city are not big, there is a slightly different feeling on either side. Buyuk Han is part of the ""northern"" feeling. Quiet place, lots of small entrepreneurs, arts & crafts and food & drinks, but mostly a monument worth walking around in.",Buyuk Han
50,"The Han is a very nice place to take a break from the crowded streets surrounding it. According to a shopkeeper I spoke to, It served the same purpose originally as the large house and palaces in Venice near the Realto bridge. They were a safe place for storage and selling on goods that came into the city for the markets. Beautifully built and decorated, there are resturants and shops a plenty. Very interesting and shady spots to just sit.And it sits in the middle of one of the biggest shopping districts in Turkish Nicosia and close to the border( five minute walk)",Buyuk Han
40,"A worthwhile visit. Gives you a great sense of the history of Nicosia and some lovely crafts available to buy. Not all the stores were open because it was so hot and some stalls have very commercial goods that are not very authentic. However, there were some lovely stalls with authentic hand-made things and the people are all so friendly. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Nicosia.",Buyuk Han
40,"The courtyard of the Great Inn built by the Ottomans. No entrance fee to see this fascinating courtyard that is full of craft shops and cafes. Certainly a tourist trap, but not too tacky! Definitely worth an hour or so's wandering around.",Buyuk Han
50,"This is clearly signed in the city,NOTE in Nort CYPRUS,Nicosia,Lefcosia,easily accessed at north end of Ledra street,walk over border,10 yards,turn right,its signed.When you entre the appature into a huge square surrounded by gallery all the way around it,a centraldome in square,toilets,lots handicraft shops,Superb cafe come resteraunt,sit out relax ,PIDE specials all hand made to order,This is where the travel guides bring there customers for lunch,its far cheaper than over the border in Nicosia,you will notice as you cross how busy the resteraunts are in North,PRICE,Yes they take Euros,Sterling,Turkish Lira most currencies.You will not be ripped off here so enjoy.Lovely shaded areas,airey in hot summers.",Buyuk Han
40,"Buy Han was a travellers lodging site in the past. It is in Northern Nicosia which is under Turkish control. The site became derelict over time but in recent years has been beautifully restored. Visitors are free to wander through the historic buildings and inner court yard. There is no entrance fee but there are small craft shops in and around the building, cafes and simple bars where you can get a snack, a reasonable meal or just drinks. It is a hospitable, calm, and relaxing site to sit and take time out amidst beautiful surroundings. Well worth a lunchtime visit.",Buyuk Han
50,"We wandered around this beautiful building which is full of restaurants, cafes and craft shops. It is lovely to see the building back to its former glory and full of hustle and bustle. There was live music on Saturday morning when we were there. Definitely worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
50,"I really enjoyed this place and I wish I had more time to sit there, drink some nice beverage and relax. You can eat, drink, buy souvenirs and make some nice photographs here. I felt like I'm in Istanbul.",Buyuk Han
50,"Each time my husband and I go here we just love it, staff friendly and food excellent in a perfect location, in my opinion a must see as it is one of the best ottoman works of architecture and was built in 1572-1579 the ground floor rooms were used as shops and upstairs were used as hotel rooms but now used as handcrafts and souvenir shops, it's an amazing experience to see and would highly recommend a visit",Buyuk Han
30,"Free entrance. More like a makeshift market than historical site.The exterior has been kept low-key much like other caravanasarai, while the interior has turned the rooms & courtyard into multiple small shops (upper floor) and a restaurant (ground floor). The fountain at the centre of the courtyard is sealed off & dry.A wall poster, but no exhibit / museum, gives a tiny bit of info on the building & its history.Stores sell a variety of jams, honey, soaps, gifts.Restaurant in the courtyard has a bit of a vibe (compared to others just outside) and you might be able to see one of their chefs rolling bread and putting stuffing into the pastry dough on one of the tables (not intended as a show, but if you are lucky it's something to see). Foods were relatively expensive.",Buyuk Han
30,"Most of the shops were closed due to it being Sunday lunchtime when we were there, but can imagine it being very nice on another day.Had a decent Turkish meal in the courtyard...although I am always weary of places where the menu has photographs of the food, it was not too bad and staff was nice.",Buyuk Han
40,"Really sooooo interesting and a slightly cooler haven from the heat! Very interesting stalls and crafts on two levels. Just a,aging this side of the green line. A must to visit...",Buyuk Han
30,"This is an ancient inn, so each room represents a room where ancient travelers would have stayed overnight. These rooms are now occupied by people showing hand-made crafts. The crafts seem well-made and fairly priced. We picked up several small gifts for friends back home.",Buyuk Han
50,It is an old medieval inn which has been restored. It is one of those places where you feel like each and every stone is telling you a story. All of the old rooms are used as arts and crafts workshops and shops where you can buy Cypriot handicrafts. All the merchants are very friendly and talkative. There is also a cafe on its main center where you can have Cyprus coffee while admiring the history. The feeling and emotions I had visiting here were amazing and I strongly recommend you visit it. (Recommended visiting time with coffee: approx an hour).,Buyuk Han
50,"This is one of my favourite places and a must for all visitors. I always enjoy a visit here and is an ideal place to meet friends and enjoy some local refreshments, from home made lemonade to local delicacies, some you can see being made. It is full of little craft shops and the owners are always ready to talk about their craft. The ideal place to buy your gifts and souvenirs.",Buyuk Han
50,"A particular attraction , impressive and magnificent . Keep flawlessly until today and is one of the main pieces linked to the history of Cyprus.",Buyuk Han
40,"Old ottoman building now full of numerous craft shops, galleries and restaurants.Worth a quick look around.",Buyuk Han
50,"Beautiful building. Internal courtyard. Restaurant, coffee shop (daytime only) and a few shops one of which sells stamps. Restaurant food we ordered was good but not cordon bleu.",Buyuk Han
20,"It's a little bit of a let down, rather more suited to a bus of Japanese tourists who think this is Cyprus of old!Building is fascinating, lots of small craft shops it the food outlet and service leaves a a lot to be desired.No shade, no return visit !",Buyuk Han
40,"A building in Old Nicosia with historical roots from the Ottoman rule in Cyprus from the 15th century.Was the ""motel"" of the time for travelers visiting the city. Included stables for animals.Nicely converted and presented with nice shops and cafeterias.Great specimen of Ottoman architecture.",Buyuk Han
40,This is such a lovely location for lunch. However it can get very busy so we always opted for an early time to avoid any tour groups. We loved just sitting in the centre and enjoying the beautiful surrounds. Some of the local delicacies are made next to where we were sitting which was amazing & the result delicious. There are a number of little market stalls/shops to browse in,Buyuk Han
40,Beautiful market with eclectic crafts. Nice to be able to walk round and see in the littles rooms. A glance to the past.,Buyuk Han
40,Old building with central courtyard that retains its charm. Restaurant in courtyard with craft shops on 1st floor. Well worth a visit if in North Nicosia old town,Buyuk Han
50,"Relaxing cafe in the han , minced meat burek my favourite and tasty lemonade, staff very friendly and attentive. Best place to recharge your batteries :)",Buyuk Han
50,Great historical building that's been tastefully modernised and is full of small shops. Great atmosphere.,Buyuk Han
50,"Steeped in history, the warm golden stone building with its vaulted ceilings makes a perfect place to have a drink and relax away from the hustle of the surrounding streets. The skill of the masons is there for all to see and quietly enjoy.",Buyuk Han
40,"When you have shown your passports and entered the North of the divided city of Nicosia you soon come across this ancient Khan. It was built in the 1500's as a trading centre. The downstairs rooms were used as shops and storage rooms, whilst the upper rooms were bedrooms. Nowadays it is a craft centre with a rustic eating place serving traditional Turkish food. The cinnamon and ricotta cheese pastries are to die for and often the lady can be seen making them. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.",Buyuk Han
40,Originally built as a rest house for visitors to the city it now houses numerous shops and craft outlets and two restaurants. A great escape from the sun on hot days as there is usually agood amount of shade,Buyuk Han
30,The building is attractive and the history interesting but the handicraft shops are mainly disappointing. The cafe is a pleasant place to stop for a coffee or a beer.,Buyuk Han
50,"This Caravansary provided lodging and protection for medieval merchants. It now hosts a restaurant and snack bar, not to mention the small shops of crafters and artisans. Be sure to tour the second floor and walk in the shops which in olden days were rooms for the guests. The vaulted stone rooms are beautiful.",Buyuk Han
40,"The place is nice, full of shops, restaurants and cafes.Old-fashioned oriental atmosphere.Good for a lunch in a calm atmosphere.Small and pitoresque.",Buyuk Han
40,"Amazing building, little shops ok but overpriced, worth dropping in as you explore north nicosia though.",Buyuk Han
40,"Cozy atmosphere, great architecture, places to eat and stroll for arts and crafts. I have returned a few times and am charmed by the place.",Buyuk Han
50,"This historical caravansarai over two floors and its surroundings is home to many handcraft workshops. The architecture itself warrants a visit to the place. I strongly suggest having traditional Cypriot pastery (börek) with mince meat and their regional cheese, Hellim accompanied by Turkish tea in the corner restaurant.",Buyuk Han
40,"I have been in this place many times... This is historical place with nice atmosphere... I like to walk in the upper level where they have many little handicraft workshops where different items are crafted in front of visitors eyes.....on the ground floor there are souvenir shops and cafeterias where they make traditional pastry ( boureki) filled with minced meat ,halloumi ( traditional Cyprus cheese) and anari ( cheese).... They also have live music in this courtyard on Saturdays in the morning( I'm not sure if they have every Saturday)...it's a must place to see when visiting Old town of Nicosia...",Buyuk Han
40,"Our Cypriot friends (architects) recommended to us to visit that Mediaeval caravanserai, which now - after having being restored - accommodates shops and a café-restaurant.It is well worth a visit to walk around and take photographs. In the middle of the building there is a stone chapel. The shops are interesting but a little bit expensive compared to other shops in Turkey.",Buyuk Han
40,"A good spot for the purchase of those arty, crafty type items at reasonable prices. There are good washroom facilities within the courtyard that operate a pay as you enter barrier. Very clean. Also a nice restaurant offering a good menu and friendly staff.",Buyuk Han
50,This is a must see sight. It has been restored beautifully to give it a real atmosphere. Yes the cobbles are not buggy friendly but I suspect they were there for camels rather than kiddies. The cafe in the corner (Sedak?) is great. Often you see the old ladies making the borek pastry with their thin rolling pins. A great spot to have a drink and a nibble. the puppeteer is worth a visit.,Buyuk Han
40,"Once you've crossed the boarder into North Nicosia, this is only a short walk in the pedestrianised area. Interesting structure, with cafe and souvenir shops.",Buyuk Han
40,We stumbled across this place by accident. Lovely building with pretty artisan shops. Well worth a wonder unless you have a buggy. The cobbles are a nightmare!,Buyuk Han
50,"very historic, charming, great architecture, friendly locals, family friendly, in the heart of the walled city, definitely recommended!!!!!",Buyuk Han
40,A heavily but sympathetically restored Mediaeval caravanserai which now has artisan shops and a cafe. It is well worth a visit to mosey around. In the middle is a curious mosque/chapel on stone pillars. The shops are interesting and not too expensive. Both Euro and Turkish lira are accepted. Didn't eat at the cafe so cannot comment on that.,Buyuk Han
40,"Great part of Ottomans buildings from 1572. It was used as a ""motel"" for traveling people in XVI to XVIII century. It was restored at the end of XX century, thats why it looks great today.",Buyuk Han
50,"this is a really nice piece of history.... you could imagine what means 'hotel' hundreds of years ago. now it is great attraction, place you can buy some original souvenirs. must come, if you are fan of open markets...",Buyuk Han
40,"This a very interesting attraction on two levels. The base has a restaurant and cafeteria offering traditional dishes, pastry dishes filled with meat or cheese and original coffee. The upper levels has many craft rooms offering original hand made craft items. A must see place and explore.",Buyuk Han
50,One of the good place for visiting while you are in Lefkosa. The best place to buy local items. There some places also inside of the Han so you can get light lunch in here.,Buyuk Han
40,Great place to visit and have lunch. There is a traditional Turkish restaurant with great food and affordable prices. Also great for a short stroll and some picture taking as it shows the spirit of that part of the city!,Buyuk Han
30,There are plenty of places to visit in the north Nicosia but I think here is the most touristic place.It was not so crowded when I visited so I enjoyed the quiet atmosphere very much.There are shops but the prices are relatively high so better not to shop here.,Buyuk Han
40,"Nice place to visit, but not that much to see, it will keep you entertained for 30 minutes. Lots of little artisanal shops that all sell the same stuff",Buyuk Han
50,"The Buyuk Han is a welcome place, to kick back with a drink and people watch as well as purchase gifts: cool fridge magnets of made with black&white archival images, to lace and knitted slippers as well as modern art. As I wandered from room to room, I was always greeted with a smile. The Buyuk Han is looked after and has its' share of cats...!",Buyuk Han
40,"Nice place to visit on your walking tour of north of Cyprus. Its picturesque, offers some small shops and some small restaurant with local food. I love to go there during hot summer months and just wonder around. Perfect for picture taking",Buyuk Han
40,"It is a historical place, turned into Cafés & bazars(gift shops)..if you have never came across something like that, just go, i think it will be loved.But if you have been to places like it before, it is worth a photo or two 😉.",Buyuk Han
10,"There was nothing explaining the history of the building . There were a few souvenir shops (nothing interesting) . Spend no more than 5 minutes, take a couple of photos and leave.",Buyuk Han
50,"This is a historical old bazaar with small shops and cafes.We had a coffee break there and tested Turkish Cypriot coffee which is called"" Con "" and it is soft version Turkish coffee.It was very tasty.Shops are selling hand-made local gifts and prices are not very expensive.",Buyuk Han
40,"A small insight into what Nicosia looked like in the past. Now somewhat commercialised, but still really worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
50,"When I studied abroad in Fall 2015 in Nicosia Cyprus, my friends and I would explore the North side of the island sometimes. During one of our visits, we decided to turn down an unfamiliar street and we found Buyuk Han. Once a place for travelers to stay and rest, it now is home to restaurants, souvenir shops and artisan shops with handmade items. The architecture is beautiful, and we thoroughly enjoyed the area.",Buyuk Han
50,The architecture is quite interesting and well preserved. You have the possibility to eat cyupriot food.,Buyuk Han
50,"Firstly, this is a great piece of ancient architecture that has been carefully restored (see pictures near the entrance. Once inside (free entrance) you can shop on the first level for souvenirs and crafts. On the ground level there is a good quality restaurant serving a range of local food along with cold Efes Pils. There is also a cafe and more little shops.",Buyuk Han
20,"I was a bit disappointed about this attraction as I expected more. There isn't anything to do apart from shopping from souvenir shops. It would be nice if there was any sign that described the sites history, because its architectural design is beautiful and it must have worth something in the past...",Buyuk Han
40,"Very close to the pedestrian border crossing. Very attractive building with interesting craft/ artisan shops, souvenirs and cafes. Doesn't take long to look round.",Buyuk Han
30,"Buyuk Han is a nice building that one can visit and will find inside cafes, restaurants and gift shops. I don't believe it is among the top attractions of Nicosia's Turkish side. Walk by, take a look inside but if you want to see a little bit more than the what most tourists get to see walk a little bit further from the Ledra crossing point in any direction, even at night. Safe and way more interesting!",Buyuk Han
40,"A few interesting souvenir shops in a handsome building in the center of ""turkish nicosia"". Recommended to pass by",Buyuk Han
40,"This is not the first time I have been here and it's safe to say that the buyuk han has greatly been improved over the last few years, it's a wonderful place to visit and maybe have a Turkish coffee, the only downside is the prices there are alittle high as it's a turist hot spot, make sure to check out the traditional hand made jewellery for sale in the shops inside the buyuk han .",Buyuk Han
20,I can tell it is a historical building by its appearance only. It is empty inside with only a few gift shops and a restaurant.,Buyuk Han
50,If you pass the border on the turkish part of Nicosia you can't miss that place. You'll find there many sellers of local arts and crafts. Inside there are also restaurants and coffee shops.,Buyuk Han
40,"Refurbished Turkish traditional inn. Beautiful, in a good shape. Many shops selling traditional stuff. I would particularly recommend the tiny shop to the left where a lady sells beautiful handicrafts made by herself. A nice terrace is available inside the inn. They also accept euros.",Buyuk Han
50,"A perfect venue for a cup of coffee, an excellent atmosphere. an ideal place to spend peaceful time for a few hours and take some pictures.",Buyuk Han
50,During the Day it's beautyfull but when it's dark it's amazing.You Can eat very good in the restaurant that's inside the place.,Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is a must-see in the Turkish Republic. There is a restaurant and a coffee shop, and many sellers of local arts and crafts. It's a lovely atmosphere. Highly recommended.",Buyuk Han
50,"Officially my favourite place ever visited! Beautifully restored 'Inn' steaped in history and has a magical atmosphere drawing people to it, Cypriots from the north and the south as well as tourists. It was built in the 1500's by the Ottomans. Merchants would stay here in the rooms upstairs and bed their animals down underneath on the ground floor. Since it's sympathetic restoration, 'old' meets 'new' here and so it is with friends too! The Great Inn (Buyuk Han) greeting and extending her warm hospitality to all her visitors. Lovely coffee shops/cafes arts/crafts and gifts/souvenirs. Wonderful band of resident cats too! An absolute 'must' if visiting Nicosia. Looks spectacular at night bathed in light.",Buyuk Han
30,"I visited the Han during restoration works and so I guess that the ambience was lost. Perhaps if I visited some other time it would be more interesting. Some people may find the tourist souvenir shops and the touristy restaurant too ""touristy"" but this is what a caravan seray is all about, right?",Buyuk Han
40,"medieval inn, modern charm, middle-eastern food, awesome prices, good music, arts and crafts all around, the perfect spot for a short break during the tour of the city",Buyuk Han
40,Having lived in Nicosia for a couple years I enjoyed and still enjoy going to the Büyük Han for a coffee and bite to eat. I love how it has been restored and the history of the place. Worth a visit if you're nearby.,Buyuk Han
50,"With map in hand we proceeded to follow the blue line walking route. The Great Khan, started life as an inn, a excellent example of ottoman construction. It is now a hub for arts and crafts stores as well as the compulsory touristy shops for postcards etc. We found it well worth a visit during our exploration of Lefkosa. There are restaurants/cafes there as well - but expect tourist prices.",Buyuk Han
50,"Wonderful spot for lunch, in the Northern Cyprus part of Nicosia Old Town steeped in history with lots of choice for eating, you must visit.",Buyuk Han
20,"This was a convenient to access courtyard right after crossing into the Turkish side. Looks a bit of a Disneyland sort of finished place, which was nice except you have it filled with tons of touristy shops and fake handmake good. The area around such as the Old Market was also filled with similar Made in China things. If you're going there, drop by, but otherwise really not interesting for those well-traveled and aware of such ""markets"".",Buyuk Han
50,"Nice surprise entering the courtyard - beautiful two stories colonnades, small, creative and colorful workshops selling arts and crafts in the afternoon sun. Strolling around is great and you can take a break in the restaurant.",Buyuk Han
40,"A well done reconstruction of a place that was loved by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. There are many things to see and do in the shops, restaurants and other amenities.",Buyuk Han
30,"Been there...... Did that..... Got the t-shirt..... Didn't get the point though!Nice, old fashioned, but not much of a reason to go out of the way for this.",Buyuk Han
30,"the first attraction as you go into the Turkish side from the Greek side. you can have a meal in this place, there are cafes and restaurants around",Buyuk Han
50,"Simply wonderful - what a beautiful old building, and all the small shops are a joy to wonder around without being hassledIts top of the list for a reason and will remain there - delightful",Buyuk Han
50,"This well preserved, restored? building is on the walking map put out by the tourist information. It is a fascinating reminder of previous eras of trade. The entry gate is just high enough to take a camel and its load- the eye of the needle. Inside is a big courtyard surrounded at ground level by many small rooms which each had doors both into the courtyard and to the outside verandas, while upstairs had further rooms off the internal open balconies. My understanding of caravanserais is that traders could overnight with their camels and goods- perhaps the goods were stored downstairs and people slept upstairs. Perhaps the central area was also a market place, or was it a coral for camels?When we visited many little shops- food, art and souvenirs- operated out of the rooms. The whole atmosphere was very pleasant- clean with lots of plants. The shop keeper we spoke to was very helpful. As we left by the eastern door a band was setting up under the external veranda to entertain diners opposite.",Buyuk Han
50,"Charming site, worth visiting the Turkish side of Nicosia. All kinds of manufactured items on sale: soap, glass and metal work, art & so on. Beautifully lit in the evenings, also restaurant open till late!",Buyuk Han
50,"I love this one ,if you are in Nicosia take the time to cross over the checkpoint and visit this great in an old coach and horses place ,you feel yourself stepping back in time.Today you can see on the top level people at work with their handicrafts below are cafes, a sight worth seeing.",Buyuk Han
50,"Lovely building, interesting shops and no pressure selling. easy to access from the border crossing and a must see if you're on the Turkish side.",Buyuk Han
50,I really loved this place! You totally don't expect what you see inside before you enter. It looks as if we went back to the past.,Buyuk Han
40,"A nice place to visit if you are walking about the old city's Turkish side. There isn't a lot to do, but the place offers you shade to rest in, a couple of restaurants, some stuff to buy and a pretty building to see.",Buyuk Han
50,"This is one of my favorite spots to hit when I'm in the area. I love the restaurants and shops and can just hang out there all day. Nice place right there to get away from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping streets. A great place to set as you ""meeting point"" when a group goes off in different directions.",Buyuk Han
30,"Like most Mosques there is nothing of note inside, but the building is amazing and very interesting history too!",Buyuk Han
40,It is a good alternative for visiting in Nicosia. There are some old gift stores there. You can feel in past yourself at Buyuk Han.,Buyuk Han
50,"Walking distance from the Nicosia check point, the Buyuk han its a nice place to spend your afternoon for a coffee or a snack or lunch.",Buyuk Han
50,Having crossed from the Greek to the Turkish side of the capital we headed towards Buyuk Han and were delighted to find such a well maintained and preserved structure. It was great to see the local crafts and accessories traders making use of a major attraction within the city. A couple of restaurants add to the feel of this place and with the building being excellently retained this was one of the highlights of Nicosia. We spent about an hour wandering round looking at what was on offer whilst marvelling at the way this building has been brought back to life. Head here and you won't be disappointed. It has a certain charm to it.,Buyuk Han
50,"Cozy nice place, you can feel the love have been made to created the place. Nice shops and cafe, a lot of home made art very well done.",Buyuk Han
50,this place is near grand bazaar and is an historical place. there are shops in there so you can buy traditional gifts as Souvenir. and there are also restaurants in there so you can eat the original food of cyprus.,Buyuk Han
50,"This is a very charming little place in the heart of a not-so-charming city. Many artists have established little studios here and sell their paintings, jewellery, ornaments, and keepsakes. The only place which made visiting Nicosia worthwhile to me, otherwise I would have been frustrated that I wasted the day.Bought beautiful handmade but inexpensive jewellery from a lovely lady who let me take a picture of her workshop.Most prices are quoted in €, but you can pay in TL and it is usually cheaper.",Buyuk Han
30,The food (mixed kebab) was just fine but the service was slow - even for Cyprus ( I am a resident). Probably better when not as busy but i would still eat there again. Absolutley fascinating setting.,Buyuk Han
50,We had a very delicious and delicious lunch with excellent service and friendly staff.Beer is excellent too.,Buyuk Han
50,Historic ottoman han converted to great place to meet and drink. It is close by crossing point and shopping streets which is a great for a break,Buyuk Han
50,"Visited this place in July in the Turkish sector of Nicosia.The Buyuk Han ( translated into English ""The Grand Inn"") with its historical courtyard filled with social eateries and coffee shops where Cypriots and visitors meet for a morning coffee and a chat, resting those feet after or before shopping. If peckish try the puff pastries filled with Hellim or mince.Worth visiting an antique shop that sells unusual stuff collected from all over Cyprus including comic books still in their wrappers",Buyuk Han
50,We had a delicious lunch in the restaurant within Buyuk Han. Traditional turkish cuisine in a very nice area. I recommend for all visiting Nikozia :),Buyuk Han
40,"Built in the 16th cent by the Ottoman governor of Cyprus this is one of the best things Nicosia has to offer (including both parts).It is in the northern Turkish part, 5 min walk after the Ledra crossing point. Built as a classic Turkish inn and middle ages guest house, it resembles that time Turkish architecture greatly preserved until present day.It is a two storied square building with many arches and a water tank and praying room in the middle. The ground rooms served as stables, shops and inns, while the upper were for sleeping.Today, there are plenty of souvenir shops, art galleries, cafes and restaurants there.",Buyuk Han
50,"Located on the Turkush side 5 minute walk from the ledra street crossing. Signposted at the ring of seats 100m from the turkish passport check. If you don't want your passpirt stamped, fill out a white paper :-) well and truly worth the visit. The courtyardbis dotted with cafes with cheap eats .",Buyuk Han
20,It's a traditional old Han (horse parking and motel). These days there's cafes and souvenir shops. Also you can see the traditional water pond where horses used to drink water out of.,Buyuk Han
50,"You should visit and try Cypriot Coffee. Yo can also eat a local dessert, ""Sulu Muhallebi"" in here.There are wonderful shops around and in the Han. You need to spent 2 hours at least for touristic trip.",Buyuk Han
40,"This building caught our eyes as we were walking down another street. As soon as you walk in it is like you have entered a beautiful oasis. The courtyard is lovely with plants and flowers and lots of handcraft stalls. There were also some popular eateries. We didn't stop at anything, just had a wander round.",Buyuk Han
40,A beautiful place with a lot of local craftsmanship shops for tourist prices. Despite there not every cell of this place was occupied by a shop I recommend every tourist to visit this place.,Buyuk Han
50,A nice short walk from ledras street. Beautiful building. Atmospheric. Effectively one of the oldest hotels i the world...All sort of pies made on the spot! Any pastry dish is heavenly. Freshness guaranteed.,Buyuk Han
50,"The building was planned as a ""hotel"" . And like all the ""hotels"" of that time it needed to be safe and sturdy to protect the people inside frome the robbers etc. So it looks more like a fortress. From outside there are no windows on first floor and it looks very boring, but as soon as you get inside you can find veery beautiful picture.",Buyuk Han
40,A nice inclosed old market area. Nice for a short visit or a drink. Many tourist pass by for a quick photo. Not very spectacular but worth a visit when your in the area.,Buyuk Han
30,"This is an interesting, 17th century, originally built as an inn for travellers. Sadly, in trying to find a purpose for the building, it has been converted into yet another opportunity for tourists to buy ""handicrafts"" - some genuinely original, but too much looking mass produced, from the surly shopkeepers - if they bother to speak to you at all.Don't go out of your way.",Buyuk Han
50,"The Büyük Han is located in the very heart of Leföşe/Nikosia. It has been fully restored and is a melting pot of art, Cypriots, tourists and small businesses.Enjoy a nice cup of Turkish coffee, wander through various arts and have a chitchat with locals and guests.It is a wonderful place to take a rest and enjoy the tranquility of Cyprus.",Buyuk Han
40,"This is the largest caravansarai on the Cyprus. Place for travelers. They could sleep here and take rest. Later it was also British prison. It's worth a visit. Nice place to have lunch or drink coffee, as there are some restaurants.",Buyuk Han
40,Wandered over into North Nicosia at the far end of Ledera Street. This historic travellers inn has an information board inside the East Door which explains its past and the regression programme. The guest rooms now house some shops selling artisan goods. We bought some delicate lace work which we paid for in Turkish Lire rather than Euros due to their adverse exchange conversion rate. Also ate an enjoyable meal in the Sediran cafe in the courtyard. (See separate review),Buyuk Han
40,A beautiful building showing Moorish architecture at its best. There is a market on the balcony which sells craft item which are a bit better than the usual tourist tat.,Buyuk Han
40,"Clean and small place for hammam. Nothing special and its quiet small. Simple hammam. Only one lady working here to do your hammam, massage and scrub etc. I expecte to have man to man and lady to lady hammam services.",Buyuk Han
50,A lovely place in the turkish part of the city obviously. The prices in the cafe bar are pretty affordable. Nice place to enjoy the sun and the environment. You can hear callings to the prayer coz the selimye mosque is near. I think you can eat there also and there is a lot of souvenir shops.,Buyuk Han
40,"Buyuk Han has a comfortably busy air about it that made me feel welcomed, but not overwhelmed or stressed.There are restaurants and cafés on the ground level, as well as shops, but I found the shops on the upper level more varied and a little bit more authentic. I would recommend shopping here for local handicraft souvenirs.",Buyuk Han
30,If you're in Nicosia don't miss this attraction but don't budget a lot of time for it. The Han is definitely worth visiting but contains small shops and a restaurant now so I have a hard time not thinking of this as a tourist trap.,Buyuk Han
40,"Interesting history, cool architecture, and just a wonderful environment to sit and soak in the sunlight while enjoying a coffee or tea. You can peruse the shops for some handicrafts and imported tchotchkes of varying degrees of quality and authenticity. There's one shop on the bottom floor selling things made by a women's collective and they have absolutely gorgeous scarves! There are also several lace shops, as well as a shop that sells craft soaps and oils and artisan olives/jams/preserves/etc. Worth a visit if you find yourself on the Turkish side of Nicosia! We did it on our way driving from Girne/Kyrenia to Larnaka... Very easy stop on that path.",Buyuk Han
50,"Lovely place, market, open court with tiny shops with local products, bookstores and bars where to get coffee or local food and rest after a walk in the Turkish side of the city. Very charming place to spend the morning and relatively good prices.",Buyuk Han
50,"Numerous little shops around the courtyard make this place a must for visitors. Here you can find anything from delicate lace to mosaics large and small. Once you have had you fill of the shops, take the time to sit and have a beer or coffee and something to eat in the restaurants below.",Buyuk Han
40,It used to be an inn for travellers to stay and rest the horses but has been transformed into an array of pretty cafes and shops on two levels selling handmade gifts at reasonable prices. There are toilets for a small fee. Well worth a visit for a relax and a people watch.,Buyuk Han
40,"I went there on december, it is a cool place to visit and chill with beer also you can buy some stuff about nicosia, you may visit other historical places too",Buyuk Han
40,If you have a half hour to spend or just want to cross the Ledra Street Border Crossing the Buyuk Han is a good place to visit. An old coaching inn from around 1572.,Buyuk Han
40,"This 16th century inn has been beautifully restored and represents a wonderful photo opportunity, just a short way from the crossing from south to north. Some good souvenir shops, on the upper level (via stairs), not tatty, far from it in some cases. Interesting ''antiques''/bric a brac shop outside the inn just by the gate on the eastern side, selling all kinds of old curiosities. Plenty of food stalls but equally if you go behind the santa sofia mosque there are restaurant tables under shady trees offering pleasant lunch environment.The toilet facilities require payment.",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is a very pretty tourist area in Northern Nicosia. After you have crossed the Ledra Street Border Crossing just walk ahead for a few minutes and then turn left, there you'll see the entrance to Buyuk Han. There are many restaurants and bars and souvenir shops. The prices are moderate, the food is quite good and in abundance. The souvenirs are interesting, too. There are many hand-made souvenirs you can buy for a reasonable amount of money.Many tourist come to this area, so it gets a bit crowded around lunch time in particular.",Buyuk Han
50,A beautiful old square with a nice cafe/restaurant and lots of small shops. Great for passing the time whilst in Turkish Nicosia.,Buyuk Han
50,"A stunning and newly restored part of the old city.The square is surrounded by high walls that contain some eclectic shops selling traditional Turkish mementos.In the square it self there are two beautiful cafe's serving Turkish coffee, tea and fresh made made delights - something not to be missed.",Buyuk Han
50,This building was use as a hotel for travellers in early days of Ottoman rule. Currently it is an attraction for those interested in hand-made goods and arts. At the enterance level there is one restaurant and one cafe/tea house. There are numerous shops that sell hand-made goods and artifacts.,Buyuk Han
40,"After entering the Turkish side of Nicosia, we went straight to Buyuk Han, an old inn built back to 1572. Around its open courtyard you can find little shops with souvenirs, second hand books and a tavern. It;s architecture is quite interesting with stone walls and archs.",Buyuk Han
50,"This place and the area immediately around it is magical. The upper floor is filled .with artisan workshops selling good quality, innovative stuff at a reasonable price. It oozes atmosphere and it is a great place to sit and watch the world go by. .",Buyuk Han
50,The place is preserved and clean. There are many antiques shopping inside. A muse see place. At the entrance there are signs that describe the history of the Khan,Buyuk Han
40,"There are some interesting shops on both levels selling pottery, soaps, paintings and handmade traditional goods. There are several artist's galleries.We ate in the restaurant below and watched a very clever lady rolling out paper thin pastry for cheese savouries -the food was excellent, varied and very reasonable.The Buyuk Han (Great Inn) was built by the Ottomans in 1572, the year after they conquered Cyprus from the Venetians it was restored in 1990.Sitting in the courtyard you can imagine the caravans arriving, the guests in their upper level accommodation with the horses stabled below, the smell of open fire cooking.Very atmospheric.Worth a visit to wander the galleries ,get away from the bustle of Nicosia and watch the pastry lady in the corner restaurant.",Buyuk Han
50,a trip into the past and a reminder of Turkish hospitality which was all inclusive and diverse. eat there and buy local products,Buyuk Han
30,"The architecture was pretty cool. There were shops, most of which sold the same types of things. Might be better during the tourist season.",Buyuk Han
50,"Have visited many times! Lots of little shops selling handmade objects including paintings, pottery, soaps & jewellery. Many of the artists run the shops. The actual building is very interesting & it is lovely to sit in the restaurant in the courtyard to eat the typical, homemade food! Very reasonable too.",Buyuk Han
50,We travelled from Kyrenia to Lefkosa in the Dolmus (stuffed bus) which was 10 Turkish Lira single fare. It dropped us off in the backstreets so we just kept walking not really knowing where we were! We finally came to this area which was really historic and filled with lovely little shops and coffee places. We did walk over the border into Southern Cyprus but came back very quickly as all we could see were shops that we have at home! We were walking around one store when we realised it was Debenhams. The Turkish side was more romantic.,Buyuk Han
50,"I had half a day to myself and I found this ,I loved it from a distance and when I got closer it didn't disappoint ,the food I found cheap and very tasty ,the coffee was hot and smelt like a real coffee house",Buyuk Han
50,"Nobel Prize winner in literature, serbian writer, Ivo Andric, has a lot of stories about places like Buyuk Han is. I felt here like I am in one of his stories.This place is full of history and you have a strange feeling while drinking coffee or beer in the middle of it. I remembered that great writer, thought about how the life on this interesting place was in the past times...it is really good atmosphere here, Buyuk Han is lovely building... Highly recommend to visit this place.",Buyuk Han
30,If you came from the Greek side you certaintly want to stop here after the hassle that you have to go through at the border. They have nice kebabs and theres little shops.,Buyuk Han
40,Buyuk Han is a cool little spot in Northern Cyprus that I recommend visiting if you have the chance. It was an old Ottoman Inn that still remains some of its old character despite the tourist shops and restaurant. We definitely enjoyed it although we didn't stay too long.,Buyuk Han
50,"You can get an excellent map showing all the main places to see in Northern Nicosia, and this is one of them. Not only is it historically interesting; it is a good place to have a rest and a coffee break! despite the modern tourists you can still envisage what it must have been like in the sixteenth century.",Buyuk Han
50,"It is a recently restorated historical building. While you have a chance to sit in a typical Ottoman Inn, you can drink your turkish coffee (preferably without sugar as it was traditionally served with a piece of turkish delight), tea, herbal tea or some other soft drinks and beverages. You might also buy somethings in the courtyard souvenir shops.",Buyuk Han
20,It's so sad to see how they have downgraded this historic old Han.It used to be one of the number one places on our list of places to visit and eat at.It has bowed to the greater pressures of cheap tourism and and cheap tourist tat.We won't be going again.,Buyuk Han
50,"Very beautiful place, there is no entrance fee for vist. There are couple of resteraunts inside, it is an ideal place for a relax meal then walk a bit around",Buyuk Han
40,"The place used to be a hotel, a prison, a caravanserai, and now it's a tourist place with galleries, workshops, and souvenir shops. It also offers a number of nice places to eat. You can spend some lovely time there.",Buyuk Han
20,"Unfortunately the entire area of Northern Nicosia is a big disappointment, and Buyuk Han was no exceptance.",Buyuk Han
40,Worth a visit if you are in the area. Feels like stepping into a different era. And a different world.,Buyuk Han
40,"It was a largest caravan-seraj in Cyprus, built in 1572The complex includes four 50-meter long two-storey buildings forming a colonnaded square with an open courtyard. In the middle of a courtyard there is a small mosque and a fountain. Now the Inn serving as a Cultural Centre, Arts, & Crafts & Café, with a lot of workshops, tourist souvenir shops and cafes in galleries and in the yard. Good place to stay and take a break in the shadow if you have got time.All tourist groups passing through the Great Inn on the way to St. Sophia Cathedral which is standing nearby. Also not very long apart is an Vegetable market, housed in an large old now renovated building and very picturesque to visit.In my opinion it can be very interesting to visit the Ledra museum-observatory on the 11th floor of Shacolas Tower, and see whole Lefkosia/Nikosia from above (see pictures attached).",Buyuk Han
50,"It is a historical khan with two restaurants and a two-floor of souvenir shops. Many of the shop owner are the actual craftsmen or women who produced the things they are selling. Do not hesitate to bargain, but do it fairly.",Buyuk Han
50,Nice art galleries and in its inner circle you will find a prayer rooms upstairs if a traditional Turkish water tank. Pretty fascinating.,Buyuk Han
30,"Known as a Caravansari it was a place of rest, with hte horses stabled below and the rooms above. Now you can admire the construction and take a restful drink yourself. The shops, mostly in the upstairs gallery are strictly for the tourist. Worth a visit for the building alone.",Buyuk Han
20,Had an atmosphere but filled with coffee pits and trinket traps. Waste of time for me. The unmarked vegetable and clothes market nearby was more interesting.,Buyuk Han
40,"the waiter is welcoming and helpful, the kebab and chicken grilled are the besssst and don't miss to try Airan drink which is part of diary product but it's salt",Buyuk Han
50,"We found this place almost by accident, walking from the Ledra Palace crossing to the main mosque. And it was a great find. A really well preserved example of a caravanserai, a place for travelllers to rest. The ground floor used to be where you stabled the horses whilst upstairs are the rooms. The courtyard has a restauarant (where the food looked a bit ifffy but where we enjoyed a delicious Turkish tea) and a collection of nice little craft shops - we bought something from one and had the friendliest service",Buyuk Han
40,"We drove to the Buyuk Han, we managed to park right by it but it isnt easy to find, we came from the North the road in is very easy to find, as you pass Haspolat coming from the east there are signs for town center (Sehir Merkezi) just follow these and turn down Girne Caddessi (Monument at the start of the street) but this street turns into a one way system but is easily navigated, you pass the Buyuk Hamam then there are two car parks first one is by a guy who blocks cars in to get as many as possible into the little car park, he has to take car keys so he can move cars to get others out 10 TL. Or further on past Buyuk Han there is a more official car park that is cheaper and more easier to drive in and out, this is only 7 TL.The area around Buyuk Han is full of little alleyways and streets that criss cross with cafes and souvenir shops. Its a great place to have a walk round and also the large Mosque and indoor market (Mon to Sat) are all worth a look, the market closes at 1pm on Saturdays. Its an ok market not very big but has usual fruit & veg, gift shops etc.There are quite a few shops selling Cypriot and turkish gifts especially the local glazed pottery that are quite unusual, you can cross the border at Ledra Street but its pedestrian only.",Buyuk Han
40,"Thisp lace is truely looking like an old caravanserey, we saw them in Syria and many other places.Recommend visiting, but, be warned the Food place inside is NOT recommended!!Eat in the free - un-occupied Zone.",Buyuk Han
50,"Two arched entrance to a lovely stone built square building.It used to be a stop over for traders, the upstairs galleried rooms are mostly shops now.Lovely arches, somewhere worth a visit and drink, in pleasant atmosphere.",Buyuk Han
40,"Historically interesting, there seems to be a reduction in the number of artisan shops around the terracing that are open, but nevertheless, do visit it",Buyuk Han
20,An old market turned into a money making and beer drinking corner. The old market has been renovated recently though the old middle arch for water outlets are still preserved.,Buyuk Han
40,"This is a great place to go it is full of lovely little shops selling all manner of souvenirs,trinkets & clothes and the shop owners are very friendly with out the hard sell which is great.There are a couple of places where you can get a bite to eat & a cold beer after all your walking around & shopping.There is a lot of history to the building and it is very atmospheric & a nice place to spend some time.",Buyuk Han
40,"A nice place in the northern (Turkish) part of Nicosia. The most outstanding secular edifice (an inn for merchants) built by Turks in Cyprus, Newly renovated, it is full of little shops with tourist trinkets and a nice place to rest a little drinking a cup of Turkish coffee.",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is a well renovated historical inn and landmark in the old city of Nicosia, North Cyprus. With its beautiful architecture, large inner open area, cafes, arts & crafts shops and workshops, it gives you a nice atmosphere and is a great place to visit and buy some traditional Cypriot art and memorabilia.",Buyuk Han
50,"This area has been beautifully brought back to life, from being a bit of a ruin to somewhere that has everything. Visually interesting, cafe's and one off shops.",Buyuk Han
40,"A calm and interesting historic site, very well restored,good balance between history and tourism.Very interesting also: photos demonstrating the reconstruction processes (pended on the walls, near the main gate).",Buyuk Han
40,This is a beautiful area which has traditional art galleries and folk art. It was built between 1576 and 1577 by Sinan Pasha who was the governor of Cyprus at the time. It is the biggest Khan of this period in Cyprus. Well worth a visit and stopping for a drink and a wander around to soak up the atmosphere.,Buyuk Han
50,"The recently renovated Turkish Buyuk Han or caravanserai on the Northern Cyprus side of Nicosia is very much worth a visit of worth an hour or two. A typical 400 or 500 hundred year old caravan inn, it is a large, two-story building surrounding a large court yard. Arcades on the ground floor historically served a storage rooms for the caravan merchants and a place for their animals to spend the night well protected. Rooms for the merchants were on the upper floor. Now the rooms are shops for local merchants and the courtyard features a couple of decent open air places to sample local cuisine. The Cypriot Turks are very friendly and accommodating to foreigners and the line between Greek Nicosia and Turkish Nicosia is very easy to cross.",Buyuk Han
50,"Here is, a historic place immediately next to the boundary. The courtyard was very spacious. This is larger than in Hasan Pasha Han, Diyarbakir. Sumptuous and magnificent architecture.You must see this place.",Buyuk Han
50,"This is one of the oldest buildings in Nicosia (North side) - the great inn where travellers used to stay - but instead of becoming a museum it is now a living collection of small shops on two stories selling a wide collection of trinkets, curios and artwork. Beautiful and interesting ... what more could you ask",Buyuk Han
40,This is a lovely place to visit - the setting is a delightful courtyard with small arts and crafts shops around it and restaurants in the middle. Items sold are mainly hand-made and unique. We had a nice lunch in Sidirhan and were delighted with this visit. Should not be missed.,Buyuk Han
50,"Step back a thousand years and enjoy yourself. Walk amongst the various craft shops or just relax and have a meal. We went to the Sidirhan, lovely food served by waiters with a passion for comedy.",Buyuk Han
50,Pleasantly surprised by this lovely place. Some very interesting items for sale - not the usual tourist tat. Absolutely worth a visit.,Buyuk Han
40,"Visited here after my niece had visited a couple of years ago. Very good with a little about the history and how they rebuilt it after the conflict in the 1970's. there is a restaurant at the bottom serving food or just drinks with free WiFi. At the top are little had made crafts, good if you like that sort of thing but nice to have a browse.",Buyuk Han
40,"Turkish part of Nicosia is not very pretty, so you value more every place which is nicer than surroundings. And Buyuk Han is. I would not recommend to travel to Nicosia to visit this attraction, but once you are there this is good place for a short rest.",Buyuk Han
30,"Great place to visit, bristling with historical facts and now a pretty little arts and crafts centre with a Bar and restaurant. The trip adviser location however came up in South Nicosia and after looking around the area and giving up, we crossed to the North Cyprus side and immediately found signs to the 'Han'. The little shops used to be temporary accommodation for travelers and there are some good photos of the original usage.",Buyuk Han
40,"To go there, you have to cross the UN buffer zone and TNRC immigration. One should carry an ID. Buyuk han has some shops and cafe inside it. It is good to visit and spend little time over a coffee.",Buyuk Han
50,"We crossed over the boarder (which is an experience in itself). Never have we known such a change in culture in just a few steps. The Turkish side of Nicosia is amazing, like stepping back in time. Buyuk Han is a lovely place to eat and shop and we met some really nice locals. Well worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
50,Was expecting everything to be touristy and very expensive but it wasn't. I guess this is because the building is a charitable trust and the rents are not so high. Don't be scared to sit and eat as the prices are ok. Check out the stalls. Some have more unusual things,Buyuk Han
40,"The restaurant is situated in the court of the beautiful Han. As many tourist groups are having their meal there we did not expect to much, but had a very tasty diner, prepared with more care than normally in Cyprus",Buyuk Han
50,"We had lunch here right after the hamam and it was very pretty, picturesque and the service was fantastic. They were prompt and very honest and helpful. I had one of their desserts which wasn't up to the head waitress' standard (although I was completely oblivious-tasted good to me) so she came over and offered to bring out a new one for me.Certainly worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
40,"Despite is limited size, the place is nice and fresh. Worth a visit although the shops do not offer a great variety of stuff.",Buyuk Han
40,"The Great Inn is located in Nicossia in North Cypsrus.When The ottomans occupied Cypruss , they biult many places and historical buildings.One of them is Great Inn , It was used for trading place at that time..and also very small mescid in middle of it.This place has small shops and they are still used for trading.It is worth to visit...",Buyuk Han
40,"This was such a pleasant reprieve from the heat (already scorching in June) and the crowded streets. It's a gorgeous building to look at, and the history and restoration are interesting points: you can see photos etc of this on the wall by the entrance. There are small craft shops lining the top and bottom floors, with unique artwork in some and souvenirs in others. I didn't eat here, but there is plenty to eat if you wanted to, in the shade as well.",Buyuk Han
50,Stopped by on a day visit from Nicosia Cypriot side to Turkish side for shopping. Lovely atmosphere - there was a live band playing which added to the laid back feel to the area. The architecture is amazing and lots of places to shop or have a snack and a drink. Would love to go back.,Buyuk Han
40,"After a hard day sightseeing with friends it was so pleasant to come to the Buyuk Han for a coffee and marvellous, home made ( and huge!) bourek. Relax and people watch or have a walk around, check out the souvenir and craft stalls and admire the architecture. It's a gem of a place!",Buyuk Han
50,"I haven't been here much, I should go more. My boyfriend goes all the time just to have coffee.Restored to what it would have been like in the middle ages. A ""BIG INN"". Great stalls. Lovely cafe making home made borek pastries. Worth a visit.",Buyuk Han
50,This place is a beautifully renovated old inn. Its at the Turkish part of Nicosia. You can also buy hand-made local crafts. Food is also nice. I strogly suggest this old historical place.,Buyuk Han
40,"Culturally very interesting and beautifully renovated old inn set around a large quadrangle, now converted to small handmade craft and souvenir shops and eating places, with both upstairs and downstairs galleries. very attractive and good for photos.",Buyuk Han
40,"Found this on a day trip into Turkish part of Nicosia, interesting to read the history behind the building and its renovation, it uses over the centuries to the present day.The upper gallery has been given over to craft shops and the lower, ground level has restaurants.",Buyuk Han
50,This is a great place to visit and purchase hand-made crafts/gifts by local artisans. A definite must-see!,Buyuk Han
50,Very nice small plaza/courtyard in North Nicosia. I believe it used to be an old monastery? The cells are now used to display handmade crafts and definitely worth browsing. The handmade jewellery is great and some lovely cotton summer dresses and hats perfect for holiday! You can have a coffee/juice/beer in the open courtyard along with some very tasty local dishes. Not supreme dining but just what you need for a short snack/rest from browsing.,Buyuk Han
50,Have had lunch and drank ice cold beer here for over ten years as green line opened at Leadra street have seen prices rise but it's still very charming,Buyuk Han
50,Of archeological and historical interest. Its been maintained at a very high standard! Of historical interest!,Buyuk Han
30,"I go there only for the BOUREKIA. It is a dessert of pastry blown in oil and inside there is sheep cheese. Ask for bourekia me ANARI. They are freshly made, delicious and in quantity!",Buyuk Han
30,"The building itself is very interesting. However, I did not think the the artistic/craft works for sale were unusual. It's worth a visit, but I wasn't tempted to buy anything.",Buyuk Han
40,"It wasn't planned, but it was a good moment of the day. In the crowdy streets we found calm place with good view, architecture, food and wine. I liked it much.",Buyuk Han
50,Wonderful peaceful ambience! Had a coffee here and meandered around looking at the various artists at work well worth a visit,Buyuk Han
40,Buyuk Han is not the most sensational of tourist attractions but it is worth a visit. There are some nice cafes within it and you can purchase traditional Turkish crafts and artwork around the outskirts of the courtyard. The architecture is great too.,Buyuk Han
40,"Buyuk Han is not anymore used as an caravansarai (and it was the largest on the island), but as a complex with coffee shops, souvenir shops and art galleries. The architecture is very beautiful, the atmosphere carries everybody a few hundred years ago, but the bad thing about this place is that is very comercial, not a quiet oasis like it should be.",Buyuk Han
40,"We visited Buyuk Han while we were in Nicosia. It was very atmospheric and there are some lovely, unusual craft shops inside. I would definitely recommend a. Is it if you cross over the Nicosia border.",Buyuk Han
50,Visited here in late afternoon and with the sun sinking the atmosphere was very special. Lovely to walk around a see some tourist tack and traditional crafts all at good prices . The coffee shops were lovely and I recommend the cous cous from the man who feeds the stall holders. Although it is set up for tourists it is done tastefully and it is a quiet place to sit and relax!,Buyuk Han
40,"The Great Buyuk Khan houses craft shops and galleries. It was built in 1576. This is the biggest khan in cyprus. There is a sadirvan, a water tank with a fountain placed on columns at the centre of the inner court. There is also a mescit, a room for praying with a small dome on the top.It is an interesting place to visit and quite unique. There is a cafe on the ground floor where food and refreshments are available.Definitely worth the visit.",Buyuk Han
10,There is no point going there for a visit. Just an old building and nothing else. It's just an old path place.,Buyuk Han
40,"During a short visit in the occupied part of Nicosia, we visited also this place, which is very atmospheric, but actually a market with coffee shops, a restaurant and some souvenir shops. The day was really sunny and we enjoyed a cup of greek-cypriot-turkish ;) coffee. It is nothing special that you have to see there. Just make a walk all around the place and if you wish enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal. We did not taste anything. We payed in euros and the change were also in euros, we lost 30 cents in the currency but do not expect to get the exact change if you pay in cash (euros). Overall we enjoyed our coffee in a special place.",Buyuk Han
50,"The Buyuk Han is definately a place to visit in Nicosia. It is located inside the old walls of the city within the Turkish sector. Sit, savour the atmosphere and have a coffee and eat baklava that has been made at one of the cafes.",Buyuk Han
50,"During my vocation at Kyrenia, i also visited Nicosia. I loved the ancient city. Most important thing in ancient city was preserved historicity. There are too many buildings which were designed in accordance with either English architecture or Ottoman architecture: such as Buyuk Han. Also When you are in Buyuk Han you may feel as if you are in 16th century in a small Ottoman village! The architecture is gorgeous, atmosphere is full of life. In the courtyard there are too many restaurants. I highly recommend travellers to taste ""sedirhan börek"" and drink natural pomegranate juice. Also you may drink beer or wine and eat meat, fish, salad or several appetizers as you wish. Upstairs there are various pretty souvenir shops. You may buy magnets, wraps, wicker goods, trays, etc...As a result, i recommend everyone to visit ancient city but first of all Buyuk Han!",Buyuk Han
50,"Really nice atmosphere. Having wandered round Northern Nicosia for a while, it was good to stop and sit in the courtyard and enjoy a beer and some food. Interesting place to visit and no pressure to buy from the many interesting craft stalls.",Buyuk Han
50,"We loved the atmosphere within this place. It was great just to sit at a cafe & ‘people watch’. We’ve been to a few of these ancient inns, throughout our visits to Turkey, but never tire of seeing them, or visiting new ones. It’s great to see the structure pretty much as it was back then, in Ottoman times, when travellers would call & stay, with their horses.",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is located on the Turkish side very close to the border. Once you are in the structure it feels like you travel to ancient times. Just like in the movies it has a feeling of an Egyptian bazaar. The place reflect the rich heritage of the island which I never knew before despite visiting many times. Also while you are at it, there's a thick blue line on the streets of northern Cyprus if you follow it, it takes you through the old city and the architecture is well worth seeing. Shame that most of the buildings are about to go down in the next 50 years or so considering how the area is so underfunded that they do not have money to renovate/look after these buildings.",Buyuk Han
50,A must if your travel to the Turkish side of Nicosia Don't forget your passport as you need it to get from the south,Buyuk Han
50,An interesting part of the history of Nicosia/Lefkosa.Was an old inn in years gone by.Lovely to sit in the courtyard and have lunch or a cool drink.A must see when in Turkish Republic of Northern Cypress,Buyuk Han
40,Stepped back in time and felt like we'd just teleported to Turkey. Atmospheric and thought provoking. Trip to North Nicosia is a definite must,Buyuk Han
40,"I really like this little oasis in the (very hot) town, we did walk over to Ledra street, no queues at the buffer zone and it was quick and painless, but it was lovely to escape the globalisation and return to authenticity, some of the art on the upper floor was excellent but I wasn't prepared to risk my luck with baggage handlers. This is definitely wort a visit",Buyuk Han
50,"This place is a fine example of typical Ottoman Empire architecture. It is romantic, you will need about 40 minutes if you want to walk everywhere.",Buyuk Han
50,"You better walk there instead of hiring a taxi. So that, you see the amazing architecture of the old city. It really is a genuine place for the people who want to chill out in a modest mood. It's not a place touched by history, it is a part of history. Please order a cup of Turkish coffee and visit the artists' gallery upstairs.",Buyuk Han
30,"I'm sure it used to be a beautiful place but nowadays it's just a marketplace, with tons of souvenir shops. You can still take good pictures but the ancient atmosphere is gone!",Buyuk Han
40,"this lovely, restored, han gives a glimpse of the way travellers in Cyprus stayed in more leisurely times.It is in the heart of the old walled city, which , unfortunately, has many run down and neglected old buildings., including , nearby another han waiting forlornly for restoration. this wonderful Inn, or Han is a trued gem. It is a huge, two storey . arcaded Ottoman building centred round an attractive courtyard. Once, the lower rooms housed animals and trading goods, whilst the upper storey housed the merchants and thir entourage. Nowadays the building houses many handicraft and art shops,plus several restaurants which spill out onto the courtyard, offering shade to enjoy a drink and snack in the warm Cypriot sunshine. Several of the small stores have lovely locally made goods, emroideries, pottery and copper ware. .",Buyuk Han
50,"My niece and I spent 2 weeks in North (Turkish) Cyprus in May 2013 near Gyrne (Kyrenia) and drove down to Lefkosa, the Turkish part of Nikosia. While finding our way to and inside the old town and then a safe parking was not exactly easy (no indication), the Buyuk Han, an old caravanserail converted into a handicraft and tourist centre, is definitely worth visiting (and the Selimye mosk, or former Agia Sophia cathedral, is next door). Off season there were few tourists but all the 1st level handicrafts/demonstration shop were closed. Plenty of tourist shops in the courtyard but we would recommend the Havva Senol (first shop on the left on the same side as the Sedirhan restaurant) where we had a smiling welcome and were offered coffees and seats while the owners were getting stamps for us from the post office. They spoke good English which is quite rare in North Cyprus (apart from imported staff from Asia or Africa...) and makes communication difficult. We spent a few hours in the Buyuk Han loooking, shopping and lunching at the Sedirhan restaurant which we recommend too (see separate report).",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han (The Great Inn) is definitely worth a visit if you are in Nicosia. You can also have a meal here. If any of your friends are asking for post cards, you'll find the best ones here. Best of all, you can buy the stamps & place your post cards in a mail box at the same shop!It does close earlyish (I don't know when exactly) so I suggest visiting it for lunch, or an afternoon coffee.",Buyuk Han
40,What an amazing place! A true oasis - cool and inviting with lovely cafes and craft shops. Very friendly and hospitable. Historically - very interesting. A place to people watch and have a cool beer or spiced Turkish tea...,Buyuk Han
40,"Lots of little arty shops. Unfortunately we went very early (10-ish) so not all were open. Historically interesting building. Nice to wander round, cool down, get a drink.",Buyuk Han
50,The Buyuk Han a place in occupied Nicosia that is worth visiting. It is a very nice and relaxing place that takes you back in time.Enjoy coffee or cold beer in cafes and choose souvenirs from the shops that are hosted in the rooms of the Buyuk Han,Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is a beautiful cultured oasis in the middle of an otherwise fairly shabby Nicosia. It is an excellently preserved and converted Ottoman caravanserai, now with smart craft outlets (admittedly more expensive than the rest of Nicosia). A great place to browse, if not to buy.A great restaurant in Buyuk Han, Sedirhan, serves authentic Turkish Cypriot meals at very reasonable prices - a great place to admire the view and people watch!",Buyuk Han
50,"Buyuk Han is a very well-preserved medieval caravanserai built in 1572. In the Ottoman age travelers and traders came together here to rest, to stay and to engage in tradeAfter the completion of an extensive restoration, it is now the central point of the (Turkish) old town of Nicosia with a mosque nearby.Surrounded by ancient walls one enters to a beautiful courtyard with small souvenir shops, artisans and cafes. The atmosphere invites to pause, rest, eat and drink. The prices are very reasonable. Buyuk Han is the perfect end to a long shopping tour through the many shops of the city center. Don't miss out...",Buyuk Han
50,"It is a unique place, historic, open, and have everything tourist wants. I strong recommend this e place and you should plan ur visit and have lunch or drink a worm drink enjoy the site its worth 1 hour visit",Buyuk Han
40,"Lots of wonderful local craft to look at and a good place to pick up some souvenirs, or just site and have a coffee and watch the world go by.",Buyuk Han
50,"I love visiting Buyuk Han. Get a coffee, sit at a table and watch the German tourists being bullied by their guide!Some interesting hand made gifts available.",Buyuk Han
50,Fantastic craft market with a great assortment of hand made goods at reasonable prices. Lovely friendly people and a great place for a coffee,Buyuk Han
30,Worth a visit to have a look around and grab a coffee. Some arty shops that you may also find a gift or two,Buyuk Han
30,"Beautiful historic building, with a nice courtyard to enjoy a drink, take photo's and soak up the atmosphere for half or so. Gift & craft shops upstairs. More enjoyable to visit on a warmer & sunny day!",Buyuk Han
50,A glimpse of how Nicosia must have been in times past. You have to get a visa to enter the Turkish sector but its well worth the slight trouble.,Buyuk Han
50,"Lovely old inn in the middle of old Lefkosa,Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.Dates back hundreds of years.Beautiful setting with several good restaurants in courtyard.Also a few shops selling traditional Cyprus goods.Have visited many a time over the years & always stop off here for a coffee or lunch if in the area.",Buyuk Han
50,"The atmosphere is great for both travellers and locals. Locals go there to remember the beautiful past and the travellers to experience the essence of the city. It is a heaven in the desert. History, beautiful food, drinks, desert, souvenier shops and real local people are the key words to the place.",Buyuk Han
50,"restored remnants of the ottoman empire now housing fine stores and restaurants; an oasis in the middle of a busy city, it offers a place to rest and enjoy nicosia",Buyuk Han
50,"Beautiful place to visit, if visiting from south Cyprus you will have to go through the buffer zone to the Turkish side and will need your passport, also be prepared for long queues at the check points. The building is very interesting and atmospheric with little craft shops and small restaurants dotted around.",Buyuk Han
40,"I have seen ruined caravanserai from buses tavelling through Turkey but to eat in a well restored one was excellent. Perhaps in ages past Suffolk boys rode stout horses with a large barrel of Adnams strapped to either side of the saddle into places like this, letting the ancient civilizations know that culture was still evolving and progressing. We do not have to have a completely accurate picture of the past to make our connection with it, do we?",Buyuk Han
40,"We can imagine this building in its hey-days, impressive and lively. This was actually a caravansara or caravansary like those found in Turkey where the animals and camels stayed on the ground floor and the owners stayed upstairs with food and a bed.We had to cross the immigration check-point along Ledra Street from the Cyprus side to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus side to get to Buyuk Han. Buyuk Han needs some maintaining and upkeep as it can be a potential to draw visitors with its beautiful square and arches.",Buyuk Han
40,The KKYC part of Nicosia was not particularly welcoming (naff shops mainly) however the restaurant we went to was very pleasant.,Buyuk Han
30,Extremely interesting from an historical point of view but now filled with touristy nick-nacks and is pretty uninteresting except from the historical angle.The cafes are for tourists--and there are 2 little girls who charge for the toilets--perhaps they're being enterrprising!!,Buyuk Han
50,"I came here having just a couple of spare hours on a business trip. Beautiful place, found on Tripadvisor. You can learn a bit more about the history of the city, look and buy the work of local artists and grab a bite to eat! Must do in Nicosia!",Buyuk Han
50,"A variety of food outlets, one more of a coffee shop, another more of a restaurant serving traditional Cypriot food. Being Turkish Cypriot, slightly spicier with some more Arabic flavours. About 25% cheaper than equivalent places south of the border. A good choice if you like your restaurants spacious and without disco music. Stunning surroundings as the building is an old Ottoman caravanserai (inn where merchants used to meet).",Buyuk Han
50,A wonderful place with an amazing feel to it. A must if visiting the Turkish side of Nicosia. Easyily sign-posted once you cross the border from the Greek side.,Buyuk Han
40,For the daytripper almost everything worth seeing in Lefkosia is in the Turkish north - sorry to any Greek friends. Buyuk Han is a handy reference point. It is now a mixture of art & craft shops and cafes. The shopping isn't cheap but there is a reasonable choice of basic food which makes it a good place for lunch. The building itself is a delight to walk around and absorb something of the atmosphere.,Buyuk Han
50,"This was used as an inn in the old times where rooms were upstairs and they had stables downstairs for the horses. Today its a wonderful spots where artists sell their handmade memorabilia, sculptures, handicrafts. You can also sit and refresh at Sedirhan Restaurant and try local specialties. Don't be shy, go upstairs and down to explore!",Buyuk Han
40,"Excellent church converted to mosque structure, conveniently located.",Buyuk Han
40,"Love the atmosphere within the old walls, friendly service - SO affordable! and eat these fried cheese anari boreks! to die for! and the portion feeds two or ....just me if ive made the trek there on a pulsing craving for their boreks:) pretty, worth the visit, and a few artsy spots u might find a good buy...at slightly more touristy prices but its all afordable and ethnic and just pretty!",Buyuk Han
50,"Perfect bulding!!! Very old with small shops to finf handmade stuff, old stuff, clothes, etc! You can drink a beer in the ground floor and admire the scenery - the building!!!!!!!!!You have to go!!!",Buyuk Han
50,"Beautiful place, a little peace of heaven.Great place to learn, walk, drink turkish coffee or eat (I was so sorry I ate minutes before, everything looked delicious)Must see!",Buyuk Han
40,"Buyuk Han is a beautiful, historic tavern just a minute walk from St Sophia Mosque. Of course there are tourist shops that you should stay clear of, but all in all it`s worth seeing.It is located in an old neighborhood of the Turkish part of Nicosia, a neighborhood with some of the most must see places in town. I would strongly suggest that people use a few hour around in and mostly around Buyuk Han, and do your best to avoid all the tourist shops.We did enjoy lunch at the restaurant Sedirhan inside Buyuk Han. Not a great meal, but good enough.",Buyuk Han
40,"nice for shopping but historical site is spoiled, expensive for souvenirs but excellent local honey in a shop on the first floor in a corner",Buyuk Han
40,"The Buyuk Han is a beautiful traveler's inn around a courtyard, but I enjoyed it most as part of a walk through the old town of northern (Turkish) Nicosia, which includes St. Sophia mosque (formerly church). There you will find prototypical British colonial architecture in many of the buildings. There is a frozen-in-time quality to this old neighborhood, in stark contrast to the modern parts of the rest of Nicosia.I recommend less than 30 min. for the Buyuk Han intself, but 1-2 hours in the neighborhood.The neighborhood includes unpretentious food shops where nuts and olives are half their price in the Republic of Cyprus (southern Cyprus).If you are doing a day trip to Northern Cyprus, it is very worthwhile and I would recommend your excursion include St. Hillarion castle--which I feel is a must and for which I recommend 3 hours.",Buyuk Han
50,"Stunning and surprising place! Please remember it is in the north (turkish occupied) part of Nicosia, so you need your passport to go there. Restaurants/bars in the basement level and local crafts shops upstairs",Buyuk Han
30,Very good stuff!!thanks for the nice time!!! will come back again,Buyuk Han
50,Large building which used to be used for travellers to stay. Now used as cafe and areas for small stalls with tourists in mind selling nick- nacs. Pleasant relaxing building,Buyuk Han
40,"From the exterior, it is just a building like any other around it. As soon as you step in, you'll see that you're in a different place. A small yard, with restaurants and shops on the ground level and shops on the first floor with handicraft items, will make day dream about the daily life of times long gone.On a side note, I guess that the restaurants are a little bit overpriced compared to the rest.",Buyuk Han
50,"I visited with a friend, and ate at Sedirhan, right inside the Khan's courtyard. Delicious Turkish food! We ate lahmajun and kebabs, and were very pleased. The stuff on sale is mainly tourist tat, not worth looking at even.",Buyuk Han
50,"A great stop in a hot, hot city. Cool off and fill up with food in pleasant surroundings",Buyuk Han
50,As you trudge through the streets browsing at all the little shops you turn left at the end of the pedestrian area and see some arches. You enter through the main arch to an absolute wonder. Beautifully restored 15th century travellers hotel now housing 2 floors of unique craft shops.Lovely cafes and restaurants inside. A perfect place to get out of the sun and take an ice cold beer. A true Oasis amongst the hustle bustle of the shops.,Buyuk Han
50,"You Must Visit, You Mest Eat, You Must Take a Foto....",Buyuk Han
50,Excellent restoration job and well worth a visit to see a touch of how like was in the past. You'll need a giude book or similiar to extract the full benefit of your visit. No entrance fee- plenty of shops to look in and a cafe.,Buyuk Han
40,"buyuk han or great inn is just 5 minutes walk from ledra street, beautiful courtyard ,cafe in one corner also little turkish coffee place,upstairs shops selling tourist trinkets and acouple of artists places you can look around,star of the show though is the building itself well worth a visit!",Buyuk Han
40,"Not far from the Ledra Street border, the beatiful Ottoman walls hide a real gem: the caravanserai (or Buyuk Han in Turkish).Once I stepped into it from the big gates, the atmosphere went back hundreds of years, even though the rooms upstairs have been turned into little shops for tourist.I really appreciated the building itself as it stands out from the rest of the town as it has been dropped there directly from the past.",Buyuk Han
