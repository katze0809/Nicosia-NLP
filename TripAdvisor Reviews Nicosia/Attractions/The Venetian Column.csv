20,It's an old column! And not a great one at that. Staggering is not an adjective that immediately springs to mind for it. Not a lot to do in Nicosia North and it's pretty grimy with typical city hustle and bustle. We were on an organised tour and were dumped there for 6 hours…,The Venetian Column

30,"The column is situated in the turkish half of Nicosia.There is a striking difference between the Cyprus part and the turkish one, the last one being unattended and less clean.Around the monument there was only dry soil instead of green grass or green plants to give life to the monument.In the Ataturk square where the column is situated you can a sit under the shadow of big old trees have a coffee or snack and ""enjoy"" the pigeons while even feeding them.All in all it was pleasant so I do recommand to visit this place.",The Venetian Column

40,"Standing tall and proud in the northern part of Nicosia, the Tower is different. The drawback is the number of pigeons that gather around it.",The Venetian Column
20,Ataturk square is an eyesore. The column does not really help. With its dry and dirty basin around it does act rather as a pigeon loo and waste bin than as a sight.,The Venetian Column

30,This column has some great historical significance and the area around it is truly a great place to people watch and involve yourself in the activities but it is not that impressive in terms of size.

(just outside the British Colonial Law Courts).During the Ottoman Period, it was called Konak Square after the Governors' mansion, more popularly known as the saray (palace), which sat in the Southeast. In 1489, the column was moved from Salamis to Nicosia as a tribute to Venetian rule on Cyprus. On top of the granite column was a carving of the lion of St. Mark, and at the bottom were the coats of arms of noble Venation families. The Ottomans removed the lion and toppled the column in 1570. In 1915, while at war with the Ottoman Empire, the column was re-erected by the British by replacing the lost St. Mark lion with a bronze orb.",The Venetian Column
