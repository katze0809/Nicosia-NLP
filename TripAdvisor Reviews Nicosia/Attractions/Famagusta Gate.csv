20,"Took two minutes to view, luckily cafe Opposite, even parks leading to area very dry and not looked after",Famagusta Gate
40,Well worth a visit especially as the sun sets down in Nicosia and you are magically let to travel in medieval times . The quietness of the area as the sun disappears among the buildings of central Nicosia and the shadows appear on the Venetian walls you are easily let to dream of how it was at the time. Best time to visit just after the sun goes down and the different shops in the area close for the day and just before the night life of the area comes alive.,Famagusta Gate
40,"The Famagusta Gate is one of three entrances which were built into the historic Venetian walls which enclosed the old City of Nicosia The other two gates are the Paphos Gate at the western end of Lefkosia, and the Kyrenia Gate in Lefkoşa, at the northern end of the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia. I have reviewed each separately, as they all warrant a visit in their own right, for different reasons.It's certainly worth a visit if you are interested in architecture, and the history of Nicosia and its Venetian walls (as I am). It's a bit of a walk from Ledra Street, and is located in the east of the city next to the Caraffa bastion, not far from the Green Line where it crosses the Venetian walls in the east.It's a squat, solid stone gate, built in the 1560s, and is the largest of the three gates in the Venetian walls. It's also well preserved, being restored in 1981. It's so named because it opened onto the road which led to the important harbour town of Famagusta. I didn't think it's the most visually impressive of the gates; my choice there gores to the Kyrenia Gate in Lefkoşa in the Turkish occupied north. Apparently it's a copy of a gate in Heraklion in Crete.It consists of two gates which are connected by a vaulted tunnel passage. There's a domed room in the middle of the tunnel to let light in. During the Ottoman occupation its said that Turks / Muslims could ride on horseback through the gate, whilst everyone else had to walk.Today its used as a cultural venue, for concerts and venues. The door was open when I visited, so I got a good glimpse down the well-lit tunnel, but unfortunately it was soon closed by security. Nevertheless I was able to get a reasonably decent view and a good concept of the whole thing.I appreciated my visit, as brief as it was.",Famagusta Gate
40,"However, be prepared for a walk from the old town which in the heat seems quite a trek. Also,not quite as impressive as we were expecting.",Famagusta Gate
30,This old fortress is a market with souvenir shops and restaurants. If you want you want souvenir in a unique atmosphere pass by Famagusta Gate.,Famagusta Gate

30,"We entered Nicosia old town through this gate. It’s nice and impressive enough, but above all, impossible to miss if arriving with own transport. Also, there was plenty of free side roads parking close to the gate. We left the car there and explored Nicosia on foot.",Famagusta Gate

20,"We went out of our way to see this gate as we expected it to be something worth seeing. Sadly even though the sign said it was open, it wasn't. A guard/staff member was inside we could see her sat down playing on her phone. She didn't even look up or pay any attention. From the outside and through the window it looked lovely.",Famagusta Gate
50,"Although it is located in the north, you would think it is the gate of the south and north, considering the political reality. The gate itself is beautiful.",Famagusta Gate

40,Insignificant piece of wall with a gate - walked past it twice and had to ask where it was. Free parking just down the road where it says tourist buses. Nicosia- lovely city - well worth a visit. Highly recommend the bazaar- prices way cheaper than the shops,Famagusta Gate
40,"Part of the old fortifications, a golden stone 'gateway' building which had a state ceremony taking place next to it when we visited. Bathed in sunshine the building glows with history. You can imagine all the people who have passed through during the centuries that it has been here. Interesting to see as part of viewing the old walls of the city.",Famagusta Gate
30,"this is historically interesting, and gives a good idea of the thickness of the walls of the city. as a defence mechanism.",Famagusta Gate
30,"This gate in the walls is actually a set of longish rooms with arched ceilings, now converted to a art/cultural center. It has been extensively remodeled, but the role/purpose of the gate is somehow lost and hard to pick up by just a walk in and around. I found the outside more interesting, with remnants of an aqueduct and various plantings in a park getting my attention.",Famagusta Gate

40,"We decided to walk around the green line, the artificial border dividing the city.We started at the Ledra palace then around the Pafos gate , once home to the aristocracy.From here working our way passed the Ledra street crossing point all the time viewing the buffer zone. Near the end is the Orfeas football stadium , from here turn to the right onto Athinas Avenue and here you will find the biggest of the 3 city gates on the venetian walls Famagusta . A large looming structure , which does hold functions and weddings within . There was a small doorway open , but not much happening when we visited.From here you could walk around the venetian walls back to the Solomos square where the bus station is or wander back in towards the city centre. Pick up a free map at the bus station information point.",Famagusta Gate
50,This old gate was a little bit tricky to find and no one seemed to have heard of it either which was rather surprising when asking for directions. It stand in a road rather isolated with businesses and building work going on around it and now looks a bit out of place. It is still very much in tact and the largest of the gates by far.,Famagusta Gate
40,"Basically the gate into the city, it's quite big and majestic, and depicts the medieval history of the city. Although very nice to see and photograph, we couldn't actually get in, as it is only for shows and concerts. So, nice to visit, but other than that, there isn't much to it. Still, it's an important part of Lefkosia, so it's a must for tourists. :) . If you walk a along the road a bit, there is an opening, and a very nice sculpture inside.",Famagusta Gate
50,"I am visiting Cyprus for a week and because of the short time we just drove by it, as we did with some other important monuments and churches. It was worth seeing eventhough it was from the car. It is amazing what cultures from so many years ago could built!",Famagusta Gate

20,According to our guidebook it should have been opened at 4pm but they did not. Some German guys with their guidebook also faced the same situation. From the outside it is nothing special (cf. picture).,Famagusta Gate
40,"This is a Gate with some history and apart from that it's the architecture of the construction that is impressive today.

50,"Well preserved, this is easily the best part of the walls. The architecture is superb, a must see location.",Famagusta Gate
40,"The Famagusta Gate sits unobtrusively down, a small street, in a short dip that it entirely fills. Beautiful stone works lovingly restored in the early 1980's, with a fabulous old wooden Gate in a giant arch. Get inside and the hidden space is Cathedral like.There are no ancient artworks, frescoes or mosaics to see but the huge emptiness speaks of its time. A guard sits at the entrance, and most welcome there are exceptionally clean toilets at the far end of the down incline. It's a great space inside the walls.",Famagusta Gate
50,Solid old gate which would have been a formidable entry point in the city. I am glad immigration at Larnaka airport was most unthreatening in comparison 😂,Famagusta Gate
30,This monument was converted into a cultural multipurpose hall divided in three long galleries and for this it won the Europa Nostra Award.,Famagusta Gate
30,"Not sure what the use of this building is at the moment. Had a stroll through the empty space, it had a fairly big sound/light system installed and a tucked away bar in a corner. Man at the entrance gave no information. Famagusta Gate did not scream ""tourist attraction"".",Famagusta Gate

40,"it's a nice historical ( venitian ) and well preserved wall gate , worth a quick visit and some photos , the cultural center was closed when we visited .",Famagusta Gate
50,This is a superb example of Initiative architecture and fortification.

Another paintings exhibition was under preparation.Visiting the location is a pleasure by itself even without an exhibition going on.",Famagusta Gate

40,Cyprus is a historic place to visit especially on the north side of the island. Despite the conflict between Greens Cypriots and the Turks (which is much better these days) its a worthwhile place to visit. History everywhere. Try the Meze as well.....more than anyone can eat I found.,Famagusta Gate

30,"not overwhelming! Interesting to see Sultan the Magnificent's Signature on the top, but apart from that, not more impressive than many other gates of its kind. Ok, we were not there at the right time to go through the tunnel to the other side. Maybe some other time;but overall Nikosia (or Levkosia, as the Greek call it), is run down, disappointing; to be a divided city does not help, for sure.So much renovation necessary; re-unification would surely allow the city to bloom again, for both parts. What a shame!",Famagusta Gate
40,"Revived city gate, great place for events and exhibitions.TIP: Free parking around the corner at the bastion.",Famagusta Gate
50,"This is the meeting place of the free walking tour which we highly recommend, as it was world tourism day the gate was open to the public, which is really worth seeing.

40,One of the gates representing the old city gatesWell preserved and maintained carefullyU must go and take photosVery nice,Famagusta Gate
40,"Famagusta gate is one of the three original entrances into the old city, and the only one currently accessible from the Greek part. It is very well preserved and concerts are held inside. When there is not a function taking place, you are able to walk around the inside of the structure and marvel at how such a building could have been built hundreds of years ago and still be in such amazing condition.",Famagusta Gate
50,"this is a must see in Nicosia. An ancient gate one of the many entrances to reach the town, it is very well preserved, it hosts events, arts, even cocktail like events. the overall area is nice too with some coffee shops and restaurants.",Famagusta Gate
30,"At night, the gate is illuminated with bright lights and the walk there is more bearable. In the mid-day, when the temperature can be as high as 40C, this is a less pleasant experience. There isn't much to do at the gate and you cannot walk through it, as the grounds are some sort of a convention/conference center.Come at night, or don't bother.",Famagusta Gate
30,"Beautiful and old, but not really what we were there for. It was more of a ""Okay, glad to have it done"" sort of sight. Either way, got some pretty photos and heard the interesting history behind the walls.",Famagusta Gate
40,"This gate within the Venetian Walls of Nicosia was constructed in 1567 and modelled on a previous gateway in Candia. It is effectively a street level 'below ground' access and egress point with earth above with a dome centre for light. It was large enough to have two vehicles pass side by side ( carts ) and was the main entrance into the old city. It has been refurbished now and the interior benefits from a far more modern and ugly ventilation system, which can be seen when you climb up on top. However, when we visited the main entrance door was locked with signs reading 'closed for refurbishment' which was a real shame as I would have liked to have seen the inside. There was a limited view through a small glass window on the main gate but this didn't offer me much insight. Still a different form of gate and one which I would like to have entered, but alas not when we were there.",Famagusta Gate
40,"One of the many gates you can find around the medieval walls of old Nicosia. Great for an evenings walk on a good day, the big green area attracts dog walkers who want to play with their pets and stay on the loop for events happening here all year long (concerts, festivals etc).",Famagusta Gate
50,"Imposing structure, full of history and tales of medieval wars and conquests.From outside you fail to understand the height and breath of the gate. Especially as the narrow entrance from the outside part of the wall, widens to become three large halls with 3 separate exits into the old city.Most of the time you will find an expo going on, be it photography, artworks or even books.Beside this gate, there's another one, more modern that hides behind it the statue of the Poet by Varotsos, which was given to the city of Nicosia by the artist. One of the hidden gems of Nicosia.",Famagusta Gate
50,This was a nice surprise to find. Its on a enchanting street - very authentic and beautiful and romantic inside.,Famagusta Gate
30,"Is basically the pathway and entrance to the city of Nicosia they used during the middle ages. You can also see the walls that surrounded the city back then which are still in very good condition. Although you cannot spend much time there, more than 30 minutes, is interesting to combine this visit with a walk to the old city of Nicosia which has a unique old architecture and relax by having a nice lunch and coffee at the coffe shops that are around there in this ancient and old environment.",Famagusta Gate
30,"The Famagusta gate is not so close to other Nicosia attractions, so consider if to walk there at over 40'C outside.Specially if it is not open for some kind of event, you'll just see the old walls and a closed gate with lot of traffic in front of it.",Famagusta Gate
40,"Famagusta Gate is one of the gates of the Venetian Walls of Nicosia. It is considered to be the best Venetian monument surviving today in the town.
