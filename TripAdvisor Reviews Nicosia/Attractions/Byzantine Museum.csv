20,"It takes a lot of effort to get there and not much to see in Nicosia anyway - internet and Tripadvisor state it’s open, the security man says to Ring the bell and then someone comes out saying it’s closed just like that ... comes across as they just don’t care and are just not in the mood of opening .... shocking lack of respect - they have the obligation to update page in order to ensure this doesn’t happenUtterly lack of respect",Byzantine Museum
40,"Interesting museum containing beautiful icons and mosaics, some going back to the 6th century, as well as 13th centuries icons including The Incredulity of Thomas. This museum had special significance to me as I recently completed reading The Icon Hunter by Tasoula Hadjitofi which chronicles her amazing twenty some odd year effort to repatriate icons that were stolen from nothern Cyprus and trafficked into Europe. I recommend reading this book to enhance your visit and also strongly recommend getting the audio headset. By the way, the museum is a long walk from Ledra Street and no street taxis were spotted outside the museum.",Byzantine Museum
30,"I went on my last full day in Larnaka on a day trip to Nicosia so I didnt leave country with not visiting the capital of Cyprus. I dont know if I ever have more bad plan before in my life. But I have been there and walked around after a not to good map for 2 hours. I passed this on may way and registrated the church the rest of buildings with not thinking so much over it. I don't now eather if I have been in a town or place where it was so little people everywhere. I tried to find the border cross that they calling it but no sucess. I write this most for having the town registrated in my system for where I have been in Europe. Temperature was so high after a time that I could not fix to go more around, left the town faster then no one before me in the history maybe. If I shall guess something about the town it most be a new and a old part. And then the town are splitted up in two by the turkey on one side and the rest in the other. Since I didnt see no one go inside here I didnt did it myself only took a lot of photo and then walked away.",Byzantine Museum
40,"An interesting museum but at €4 each I expected it to be a bit bigger. I guess it felt a bit smaller, 25% smaller to be exact, as a quarter of it wasn’t even open. Would’ve felt that €2 each would’ve been a very fair price. The art exhibition were excellent though and of great interest if you’re into art.",Byzantine Museum
40,Ground floor features an extensive collection of byzantine religious art and icons primarily from Cypriot churches.Next floor contains various WesternEuropean paintings from the 15th to nineteenth centuries and the top floor displays maps and paitings by Greek artists.,Byzantine Museum
40,Visited her on a Coach tour. Very interesting and very hot.pretty. Pretty church although I don’t really do churches as Religion does nothing for me. Still the history was interesting.,Byzantine Museum
50,Excellent collection of icons and other religious art. All well signed and lit. A manageable collection for a mornings break from the heat. Well worth a visit if you like icons.,Byzantine Museum
50,"Anyone who visits Nicosia, this is a ""MUST SEE"", just STUNNING, AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL.Sadly, it's NOT ALLOWED to take out pics inside.",Byzantine Museum
30,"We arrived here on what was Museum Day at all the other locations on the island therefore no one paid anything. Yet here we were told the following day was going to be the Museum day. We were not even offered the audio guide and no much information was written.Also we were not told we could visit the upstairs where apparently more exhibits were.The ground floor had a multitude of icons and some religious items, similar to what we have seen in different islands in Greece and which I grew up with therefore not as interesting as paintings for example, which I really like studying.Also, no directions on how to reach this place in the scorching sun, so we had to keep asking the locals as we came from Ledra street, several hundreds of metres away.No pictures of filming allowed inside, thus you cannot promote what is dear to Cypriots' heart.Good architecture outside though.",Byzantine Museum
50,Very good Byzantine Museum for understanding the history of this country. The old icons are lovely and they will teach you the basics of Orthodoxy!,Byzantine Museum
40,"First off, the name of the museum is a little misleading. The first and second floor of the museum houses Iconography only and the third floor house work by local artists.Some of the artworks are of very high quality, others in various staged of advanced delay and a lot in between. I decided to take the audio guide and it was very useful. Likely I would've gotten really bore looking at nothing but iconography.I especially enjoyed the audio guide discussion of donor art, the Templon/Iconostatis exhibit and the exhibit of art looted by the Turks after the 1974 invasion.Good, but a bit more variety would make the visit even more enjoyable.",Byzantine Museum
50,Archbishop Makarios III foundation exhibits the history of the first President of the Republic of Cyprus.A place undeniably important for people that what to find more about the island's history.,Byzantine Museum
40,"Our local friend recommended a visit to the Foundation's museum and gallery. With a modest interest in art we spent a pleasant couple of hours going through the religously themed art gallery and then focussing on the Byzantine icons. The latter were a gem. Although we arrived late morning, we were unable to see all of the other sections of the Foundation's collection as these closed much earlier than the main Byzantine section on the day of our visit. Modest admission fee.",Byzantine Museum
40,This is quite an impressive building and the museum inside it is also interesting. The entry fee is quite low. There are many icons and other artifacts from Byzantine cathedrals and monasteries. It is an interesting museum also because you do get an education of the history of Nicosia.,Byzantine Museum
30,I was in the area and went out of curiosity.some eye catching items.Also. a propaganda piece about how the Turks were destroying everything.In my view true or not this has no place in a museum.,Byzantine Museum
50,"One would need at least 3-4 hours to do justice. With a low entry fee of Euro 4, I entered the musuem with the whole day to spare.On the ground floor outside the entrance they had the history of Archbishop Makarios with pictures and with a short description which was very informative.Once you entered the musuem on the ground floor there were icons from different churches and different parts of Cyprus. One could marvel at such high quality work and the details. Cameras are not allowed and rightly so to preserve the icons.Outside the building on the first floor there are paintings from different parts of the world and from 15th century onwards one could see at close proximity a very good collection of paintings.The second floor had the history of the armed forces and some cultural customes.When you buy your ticket they have a small shop where they sell books and other souvenirs. They also sold Commandaria wine at a much cheaper price.",Byzantine Museum
40,There is a superb collection of magnificent Byzantine icons. There are more than200 pieces from several centuries,Byzantine Museum
50,The collection of Icons is extensive and demonstrates their long history. Many are in excellent condition and could almost be contemporary. There is an interesting insight to the problems a divided Cyprus faces in mosaics taken from Christian Churches in Northern Cyprus by Turkish dealers and recovered via German courts and now on display here.,Byzantine Museum
50,"I love Greek icons and this museum has one of the finest collections I have ever seen in my life, this visit is a must for the enthusiast and tourists alike, it can be walked about to get a flavour of it in an hour or leave at least 2 if you like this type of art.Shame you are not allowed to take pictures and they dont have a book with the collection either.Most of them are rescued icons from illegal trade and desecration... so it s a great conservation effort",Byzantine Museum
50,"When it comes to rating museums for their icons, we liked this one best. Better than the one in Thessaloniki, although that museum has a much more varied Byzantine collection, or Athens, which is really good, but does not have a very impressive collection of icons. We did not have time to view the art gallery here in Nicosia.",Byzantine Museum
30,"I have a cultural interest in icons, as I am of Cypriot heritage and am fascinated by religious history. However, there are a lot of icons on display and the museum would not be everyone's liking. The artwork that was plundered from the North is of particular interest, as it has been recovered from the black market.",Byzantine Museum
40,This museum is off the main area of Nicosia. The building and Byzantine church are very interesting. Large area inside covered with holy paintings and relics. Entry E4.,Byzantine Museum
50,"The Byzantine Museum is part of the Archbishop Makarios III Foundation compound; it is huge, clean and very well organized; it has a huge collection of old Byzantine Icons, Paintings and Mosaics; you may spend the whole day wondering the beauty of the Icons.Unfortunately photos are not allowed even without a flash; still the 4 Euros entry fee is perfectly justified especially that it also covers the Art Gallery on the second floor.",Byzantine Museum
20,It's a very small museum consisted of four rooms. All the exhibits are poorly presented without good descriptions. Disappointing experience.,Byzantine Museum
40,"This is a great collection of Byzantine icons. Nice, well displayed and explanatory. Unfortunately the palace is open only once per year...",Byzantine Museum
50,"This a unique collection of Byzantine icons, mosaics, wall paintings, manuscripts, wood carvings, vestments and ecclesiastical utensils dating as back as the 12th century and which apparently were collected for conservation and protection under the same roof, from rural churches all over Cyprus.The Art Galleries on the upper floors house works of art by Cypriot artists of the 20th century, Greek artists of the 19th ant the 20th centuries and Western European paintings from the 15th ant the 19th centuries.",Byzantine Museum
40,"With map inhand we did a self guided tour of the walled city, is this lovely area. the Gallery is located behind the small church in itself is worth a look, for us the religious art was good to see, that had been saved from being destroyed,",Byzantine Museum
30,"The church on the grounds is beautifully decorated and is worth a quick look, but the museum itself displays nothing but religious icons and modern art (a strange combination). I'd expect a ""Byzantine Museum"" to include other things in its collection, from weapons, to coins, to tapestries, or pretty much anything else from the period.",Byzantine Museum
30,"We stumbled across this art gallery which is just next to the Folk Museum and behind the Archbishop's palace. It's a little hard to find and you have to get tickets from a small building separate to the main entrance.We visited in August and the folk museum was closed so we went here instead with our two children (12 and 9). It offered good respite from the hot August heat in Nicosia and if anything the children enjoyed it more than the parents.It only cost us 10 Euros for all of us to get in, although our youngest didn't have to pay for some reason, so it's pretty cheap.The main large room on the ground floor is full of religious paintings mostly from the late Byzantine era (approx up to 15th Century), and a fair bit from a bit later (presumably under Ottoman rule). If I'm being honest the dour religious paintings are from before the European reformation and therefore the artwork is not great technically (don't expect anything like a Leonardo de Vinci). However, like I said, the children genuinely enjoyed it which very much surprised me.I preferred the mosaics and their stories which had been plundered from Northern Cyprus by unscrupulous smugglers and then sold to collectors (who all seemed to be in Germany)! They were tracked down and the German police assisted, then the work was repatriated back to this museum / gallery.Also interesting is the chronological history of Archbishop Makarious III, in the entrance hallway. He was the infamous leader of the Cypriots and led the successful struggle against British colonial rule, only to see the island divided 14 years later. He's a controversial figure, but still held in very high regard in the Republic of Cyprus.Note that photography is forbidden inside the gallery.",Byzantine Museum
50,"You will want to add this to your list of sights to see when going into the old, walled city when doing a walking tour.",Byzantine Museum
40,Beautiful spot to visit. Home of president is only opened for tourist on 3th of august. Next to the building is a small historical church which is a must-see. Beautiful wallpaintings and fresco's. Warning: can be a bit crowdy.,Byzantine Museum
50,one of the best museums i have ever seen .. its really awesome !! awesome collections and really friendly staff .. i would definitely go back again !,Byzantine Museum
50,"The icons in the byzantine museum include some of nicest ones in the world. I particularly like the ones with animals, such as the ones of St Mammes.",Byzantine Museum
40,"I enjoyed it, however not all people are so found of history. Otherwise, a quiet place with interesting background.",Byzantine Museum
30,If you love old art work then this is a must. Personally there are only so many church relics I can view before wanting a change of venue. The history of some of the pieces is interesting and well worth a visit. There was a National Guard exhibit in the basement but it would have been better if there was an English translation to the exhibits rather than all in Greek.,Byzantine Museum
30,"This museum is next to the Archbishop's palace and the Folk Art museum. The main downstairs area is full (and I mean FULL) of icons hanging from floor to ceiling. There are hundreds in there, and the effect is overwhelming, just not in a beautiful way. You can't take in the history and craftmanship, you're better off visiting a smaller church and seeing a few in the proper context. Plus you are stalked by the paranoid attendants who want to stop you taking photos. Upstairs are further exhibitions of 18th-20th century art. They also make the point about Turkish destruction and German art thieves over and over again until the whole propaganda bit becomes wearing.There is one decent recreation of a small church, with a painted cupola, which really has a peaceful atmosphere, but the rest is just too much.",Byzantine Museum
50,Very interesting with very good tour by professionals. I think that it was best Byzantine Museum that I have ever visited.,Byzantine Museum
20,Big area and building with historical sense but nothing extraordinary. It's a place to take 2-3 photos and that's it !!!,Byzantine Museum
50,"This gallery is just opposite to my school. They used to take us to the Cathedral for the Great religious days. I visited the gallery few times, always founded it lovely. Used to pass by the archbishopric every day. And always liked it.",Byzantine Museum
50,"I love icons, and this museum is full of fantastic ones, as well as the famous 6th century mosaic fragments from the church of the Kanakaria. The collection is stellar and well presented and labeled. The wonderful frescoes from the church of Agios Ephimianos (Themonianos) are also there. Well worth the price of admission if you are interested in the historical paintings of Cyprus. If you aren't that interested, it's a bit steep. Look carefully on your map to find it as the streets really wind about in that part of town. Be sure to visit those churches in Cyprus that still have their frescoes on their walls.",Byzantine Museum
40,"It was only open for restricted hours. VERY difficult to locate, as no one in Nicosia seemed to know where this was, and I asked dozens of people. Very expensive entry fees, and strict rules on photography. Much of the gallery was closed off anyways, once I managed to find it. No free brochure, like most other museums provide. Overall, not a visitor friendly place, and I visit a lot of museums.",Byzantine Museum
50,"Tucked away in a corner of the old town, but well worth a visit - a large and comprehensive collection of icons and religious paintings from all over Cyprus well-lit and presented. Also an interesting sidelight on the theft of icons, not only by invading Turks but by venal UN officials as well!",Byzantine Museum
40,"It cost four euros to visit the art galleries that make part of the museum. Part of the site are not open to the public as they are government buildings. There is a small church in the grounds that was worth visiting but you cannot take pictures and we were quickly followed in to ensure this. The galleries are amazing if like myself, you are into icons. They had a recent shipment that had been found in Munich. The treasures were removed and sold after the 1974 troubles on the island. There was a video showing how churches in the North of Cyprus had their icons removed, even from solid walls. It was sad watching it, but there was a war on, and things like that happened all over the world. No photos were allowed of the icons. Some were in pieces.The museum is named after the Archbishop Makarios the third and the last time I visited there was a huge metal statue of him, it has now been moved to his grave!Interesting and definitely worth the visit if you are in the area.",Byzantine Museum
20,"The buildings are huge, especially in respect to the typical size oh houses in Nicosia in the old town as well the new part of the town. We visited the Byzantine Museum and actually we were not impressed. The concept was to exhibit religious pictures from the Byzantine era. If this is of interest for you, you may enjoy it, but we were not that much. There are 3 or 4 large rooms within the museum and you can get around easily. It is not large and maybe 30 minutes are more than enough if you do not follow a personal guide.",Byzantine Museum
50,"I like icons, always did. And even more so since the vagaries of life turned me into a Greek Melkite Catholic. Spending a month a year in Greece for the last 15 years didn't hurt, either. This introduction only serves to explain that we understand and enjoy icons. This collection contains only great icons, beautifully presented. Most churches in Greek Cyprus just have a few good icons, and the surviving ones in Turkish Cyprus only contain junk, all the good stuff having been looted and whisked away to Switzerland or the US. So this museum is a treat. We visited with a group and skipped the art galleries, and I have no idea what we missed there. But we were delighted with the icons! The bad news: no photos, and they watch you.",Byzantine Museum
50,"Archbishop Makarios III Foundation - Byzantine Museum and Art Galleries, located at the centre of old town of Nicosia, in the Archbishopric yard, next to St. Ioannis cathedral, that is worthwhile to visit and opposite Pancypian Gymnasium and Severios Library.The artworks dated 15th - 19th century, were collected from Archbishop Makarios III, in 1963.Byzantine Museum is fantastic,very rare and has wonderful icons from various churches, some of these were in the Turkish occupied area,were sold by smugglers of antiquities,but at least are returned.There is a fee to pay, but is worthwhite !",Byzantine Museum
50,"Here you can find works of art from Cyprus, Greece and the rest of Europe dating from the 9th to 19th century.There is special emphasis to the paintings based on the Greek Revolution against Othoman Empire of 1821, the Cypriot Liberty Struggle against British Empire of1955-59.There is a section for artworks saved by churches that have been vandalised in the occupied areas.There are also artworks by contemporary Greeks and Cyprots artists...",Byzantine Museum
50,"It is within an easy 10-minute walk of the hotel, but bring a map as there are many turns. The collection is based on Cyprus Icons and the oldest one we saw was from 1150.",Byzantine Museum
30,"The first impression of the Makarios complex is that it is pristine. Not a single stone is untidy. Everything is just perfect. The Archbishopric is next door. I think it is closed to the public but you can see the two limousines used by Makarios in a glass box near the entrance to the Byzantine Museum. Don't miss the exquisite church by the entrance. Fierce reminders not to take pictures are there presumably to protect the postcard trade: no flash is OK but no photos is not acceptable.The Box Office (small charge. I think it was EUR4) is tucked away to one side. The musuem itself is a bonanza if you like icons. Hundreds of them. Of course they do not look the same but you have to look hard. Slowly you can see stylistics trends, materials development. Relatively rcent icons.. 17th century onwards. Was that an El Greco? No but somehow but there are signs. The general impression however is of little change; a stasis of conservative imagination. In one corner there are mosaics and frescos from churches in the occupied Turkish-Cypriot areas. Recovered thanks to the German Police in the 1990s.After visiting the complex wander over the mosque not too far away (can't find it on tripadvisor). EU and UNESCO funds are restoring it as they have the delightful hamman building opposite the mosque (Europa Nostra award for restoration). Good to see these international funds restoring the heritage of Nicosia. Wander towards the barrier with Turkish-occupied Cyprus and see the decrepit run down buildings approaching decay and dereliction. The Orthodox Church is a major landowner.",Byzantine Museum
50,"It was great to visit a lovely piece of history and learn about the foundation and also just read about their history. If you are that far , go visit its worth it.",Byzantine Museum
50,"Do not miss this wonderful museum. It has a fantastic collection of icones, some dating back to the 10th and 11th century. Icones are sometimes changed as they have an even wider collection available and not all could always be on display.",Byzantine Museum
50,Loved the paintings and how the museum takes visitors through various times. Saddened to see how churches have been ripped off the wall art and how Cyprus is facing tough times reclaiming their heritage.,Byzantine Museum
50,"They have rescued and preserved over 300 painted icons from churches all over Cyprus, including the Turkish section. A stunning collection.",Byzantine Museum
50,"We visited this museum, backing onto the Bishop's Palace, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Beautiful collections of icons; religious items, including textiles; and some antiquities, in a charming venue for a low price.",Byzantine Museum
30,"This is a small museum, but it specialises in Religeous Icons. Now, if this is your thing, you're in for a treat - there's some really great pieces here, though most are from the 17th and later centuries - The Byzantine Empire ended in the 15th Century, so only a couple of items can correctly be described as Byzantine. The rest are in the artistic style, but are a lot later.",Byzantine Museum
30,"predominantly filled with icons, and its easy to say whenyou've seen one you've seen the lot! but it was interesting enough, especially on a wet day.",Byzantine Museum
30,You have to be into Greek Orthodox icons in a big way to find this absorbing. Some 11th C. Tryptics are amazing,Byzantine Museum
30,"We were the only visitors to this museum on a mid July day. You have to walk across rough ground with building remains on to get to the museum, which doesn't consist of much. If you like this sort of thing then visit - if you are not keen on fairly boring museums then give it a miss.",Byzantine Museum
30,"Lovely icons and items retrieved from religious building on Cyprus, that would otherwise have no doubt been lost over time. Charming gentleman on the entrance with great knowledge and English spoken.",Byzantine Museum
50,Fantastic display of icons covering hundreds of years.,Byzantine Museum
