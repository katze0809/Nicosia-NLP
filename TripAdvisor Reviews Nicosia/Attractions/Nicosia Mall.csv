20,If you are a disable person or old person and you need services for disable people change your mind the service point its in the middle of the ground floor approximately 600m away from the entrance. The security services at the parking cannot give you any assistance and you must go to the service point to take a wheel chair. If you are alone or with jther old person you CANNOT have access in this Mall.,Nicosia mall
30,"This Mall is okay as far as they go, that said, it's fairly expensive. Some shops do VAT free purchases if you have your passport and are prepared to claim when you fly home.",Nicosia mall
40,As expected for a shopping mall in Cyprus.We had already seen Kings Mall in Paphos so had an idea.It’s very spacious with a variety of shops but just felt there was a lot of wasted space.Worth a trip if nothing better to do.,Nicosia mall
40,I like Nicosia Mall it's very spacious and easy to park.Very helpful Staff in the Shops.Good selection of places to eat.I always enjoy Costa Coffee.,Nicosia mall
40,Nicosia mall is a beautiful new mall with lots of shops and restaurants to choose from. Some unique ones for Cyprus.,Nicosia mall
10,"Decided to visit Nicosia for the day and we wish we hadn’t. It was a wasted day and felt really uncomfortable here. Couldn’t wait to get back to our villa in Latchi. Went over the DMZ and found a tourist trap of shops consisting of gold , bags and tack. The only one thing we did enjoy was the Buyuk Han . Lovely building with lots of individual craft shops . Don’t go on a Sunday as the majority of the shops are closed.",Nicosia mall
40,"Went today and enjoyed the experience. Loads of shops to cater for all budgets. Places for kids to play, supermarket and food court. Everything was clean and the cinema was also there.",Nicosia mall
50,"if you wish to spend your day for shopping and you are in Nicosia, this Mall has it all: shops, cafes, restaurants, cinema and ... the cheapest supermarket of the island!Parking is convenient. The most famous clothing brands are there: ZARA group, NIKE, ADIDAS, M&S as well as PUBLIC (for books and technology)",Nicosia mall
40,The mall is spacious and has nice shops. I like mainly the rio cinema with comfortable big coaches and nice surrounding dolbi system. I enjoy watching movie there. The parking is large also you can always find a place to park your car. During the week end I recommend for families and friends to eat and spend nice time,Nicosia mall
50,"A very large shopping center with a lot of stores and places to eat, there's also a cinema and a food court.",Nicosia mall
40,The new Nicosia mall looks like an exact cut and paste copy of the mall in paphos. It’s shops and layout is almost identical but it has more flagship stores. Worth a visit for a shopping spree!,Nicosia mall
50,"The biggest mall on the island - there are literally hundreds of choices for shopping, dining and for entertainment. The mall corridors are very spacious so it never feels too overcrowded. It's a great day out, you can literally spend the entire day inside and not even realize it! Very child-friendly, they had some activities for children during the Easter break and the girl at the information desk was very helpful (they even give you a map). There is also a cinema (with surprisingly comfortable seats). Definitely recommend it!",Nicosia mall
50,"This is definitely the best destination in Cyprus for shopping as well as for leisure. It is by far the biggest mall locally and its very easy to reach. It has great variety of shops, including a range of monobrand stores which you can only find here such as Calvin Klein Jeans, Napapijri and many others. The selection of high-street brands is also excellent. The overall atmosphere is welcoming and airy, with wide corridors. The smart parking system is definitely a plus and it keeps us going back every single week.If you are looking for an upgraded cinema experience, you can also find it here.The dining selection is also fantastic and the cafes offer great views of the outdoor.Highly recommended.",Nicosia mall
40,"Very nice mall with a lot of choises in clothes and shoes shop for everyone. I like it because of the shops (clothes, shoes, supermarket,electronics, decoration etc) and the cinema too. There 're also a lot of food choices and cafe also.",Nicosia mall
20,By UK standards a smallish mall. A good range of clothes shops for the Island. Very little for children. The cafe Nereo on the top floor has great views of the mountains and is one of a number of places with this view. Parking is free and easy. If live on the Island it is a good place to go for what you need. If you are visiting you are likely to have better at home...,Nicosia mall
50,Nicosia Mall has been well planned and located away from the main Tourist and Business Areas which makes it easier to get to. Plenty of Free Parking and set in an area which will look very nice once the greenery and plants have had time to grow. The Outlets are plentiful and there is a number of Take Away Food Outlets as well as Coffee Shops. Set out over Two Levels with Escalators & Lifts available and Toilets to satisfy those who need them. All round a Good Day Out.,Nicosia mall
40,Easy parking and many shops to choose from. Food court had a good selection and lots of places to sit down and enjoy the view!!,Nicosia mall
40,"Very nice restaurant with excellent food, cosy environment, good service, the staff is very friendly",Nicosia mall
50,"Having travelled to many countries, I have had the chance to visit many malls.This one is right up there with the best of them.It is very open, has lots of shops, plenty of places to eat and drink and loads of parking.The only thing it doesn't have is a cinema and that is probably because the largest cinema chain in Cyprus has a 6 screen cinema 15 minutes away.Very enjoyable and somewhere you can keep on coming back to.",Nicosia mall
50,New and modern Mall in Nicosia. Plenty of beautiful shops in a very nice ambiance. Also nice cafe shops and restaurants. Worth the visit.,Nicosia mall
50,"The best place to go for shopping. Comfortable and shoppers’ friendly.Everything you need you can get. Supermarket, high quality butchers shop and fruit market. Shops that cover all tastes and all budgets. Food court I can say one of the best “Food Markets” I’ve ever been. Located in one of the prime spots of the Mall with a huge smoking area.As stated on the title THE BEST MALL BY FAR.",Nicosia mall
40,"I have to give 4 or maybe less because of the parking. Went on a Saturday afternoon, and there were cars parked on the roundabouts, on the kerbs, on the approach roads. I was shuttled into a muddy field to park, and thought I might not get out of this space later. Anyway, when we did decide to leave, i was impressed that at least they have outside lighting, so while I had to walk a kilometre to find my car, at least I could see where I was going. I don't think I will ever go on the weekend again.Onto the shops, great choice of shops. A Mall for average people, not the super rich. Plenty of each category, unlike other mall we can mention. plenty of beauty shops, and shoe shops and handbag shops. Shops I haven't seen in Cyprus like Wallis. Lots of sports shops.Onto the coffee and restaurants. Not many seats to get a coffee and sit down. We went to Costa coffee and grabbed a table someone had just left. Very prompt and friendly service.Same shops as other malls, but much bigger, such as Zara and Public.A good day out, and if you are looking for something specific you have a good chance of finding it.I'll wait for a quieter day next time.",Nicosia mall
50,Hands down the best shopping experience in cyprus. Excellent choice of brands and a great shopping experience.,Nicosia mall
50,"An amazing mall, with a huge number of shops for anything one needs. The layout is so functional. If you want sports goods or cosmetics or anything really, you can find most of the brands conveniently situated near each other. No more running around the town to see each brand!I also loved the ease of parking with its smart parking!And it's so close to the city.",Nicosia mall
50,"This place is superb. Every dish is delicious and the portions are extremely generous. Be prepared for queues if there on a weekend though as it gets very busy.Final thought: try the crepes/waffles. My recommendation is the black coconut crepe which is outstanding. Have it with nutella and your own choice of toppings, or opt for the restaurant's set combo of coconut flakes, nutella caramelized pineapple and ice cream. Eating is believing.",Nicosia mall
50,"Great Location, very close to nicosia center!Variety of shops, nice restaurantsVisit POW! The Shop on 1st floor you will love it.Great shop for American candies, merchandise from movies, series, video games etc...TIP: THE EASIEAST EXIT TO NICOSIA IS TO TAKE THE EXIT TO TROODOS AND FROM THE FIRST EXIT TO KOKKINOTRIMITHIA TAKE THE WAY BACK TO NICOSIA. 4 - MINUTE DRIVE!!!",Nicosia mall

50,"We made our Maiden visit to the recently opened Nicosia Mall and found the whole experience very good. The vast majority of available outlets are occupied and the whole place is tastefully and of a high quality finish. Fast Food, Coffee & Snacks together with a couple of Taverna/Restaurant type Outlets. Plenty of shopping outlets to satisfy the majority of shoppers requirements and all are very well laid out with plenty of polite staff. Parking is free which in the Nicosia District a Bonus. The Mall is well located away from the main areas of the centre of Nicosia and good infrastructure is still being created.",Nicosia mall
