50,"Large selection of their own brews, good food. Live music too (with good sound) occasionally. Worth looking up!",Pivo brewery
50,Brilliant microbrewery hidden awAy near leora street. Great food amazing beer. Don‚Äôt visit Nicosia without trying.,Pivo brewery
50,"I just had dinner here. The beers were great. I had a dark Czech, strong Saison and a smoked lager. Each one was top notch. I also had a dinner salad with chicken that was very good. Service was friendly, quick and professional. I go to a lot of brewpubs and I thought this one was outstanding.",Pivo brewery
50,"Really nice bar, loads of different beers (although I must admit I ordered wine - which was very nice!) We had dinner here as well, two vegans in our group had the same pasta dish which was really delicious. The place was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely go again when next in Cyprus.",Pivo brewery
50,Just off the main area this is hidden away and a little gem. Lovely micro brewery with great food as well at a reasonable price. Very quiet when we went early evening but worth booking a table as does get busy.,Pivo brewery
50,"A nicely renovated house in the old part of Nicosia that has been converted to a brewery. They produce 4 beers all year long and they offer some others seasonally.Great service, helpful stuff and reasonable prices for the quality. Beer about 5 euro per pint and each plate about 13 euro.Highly Recommend, we will visit it again soon!!!",Pivo brewery
50,Probably the only place on Cyprus with a great beer! Guys really love the job they do ;) my special advice - try the ribs!,Pivo brewery
50,"PIVO, a place you should visit in NicosiaThe ambience is perfectThe menu is just what you needTheir custom made brewed beers, just perfect ...try the <<blondie>>",Pivo brewery
50,Excellent craft beer. A family-owned business. A beautiful renovated old house and garden in the centre of Nicosia. Their craft beers won in several beer competitions in Europe! A very nice food menu to choose from. Beautiful patio to enjoy the Nicosia sky.,Pivo brewery
50,Great beer worth a visit if your a real ale enthusiast it‚Äôs a must. I would certainly go again great day.,Pivo brewery
40,"The PIVO Microbrewery close to Ledra Street/Center in a small, plain back-alley opens up into a beautiful old building in a modern industrial look.They serve a variety of craft beers - all I have tried so far very tasty.The food menu could be more comprehensive but nobody will go home starving.Anything craft and made with love is not exactly budget-friendly but worth to pay a bit more. Your tastbuds will appreciate it.The staff is friendly and attentive, for questions about the beers and production processes you better talk to one of the co-owners.You're better off reserving a table as this place can get very crowded or arrive before 7pm.One of the extra questions below concerns wheelchair accessible: The downstairs restaurant and bar area is suitable for wheelchairs however the restrooms are upstairs and I didn't notice an elevator. Maybe ask the english speaking staff ahead of your visit.",Pivo brewery
50,"This has become our regular place to dine in. We love the decor and ambiance, service is fast and efficient and of course the food is excellent. It‚Äôs always full so these guys must be doing something good.",Pivo brewery
40,"Within the old town of Nicosia, friendly staff, nice atmosphere, nice food, very good freshly brewed beer, nearby underground parking.",Pivo brewery
50,"Very nice place indoors and outdoors. Excellent fresh beer, very good food even though portions are little small.Polite staff",Pivo brewery
40,"A lovely interior in an old restaured hugh house in the Old Town of Nicosia. Very friendly and welcoming owners (studied brewery science in Czech Republic) and very friendly staff. All beers freshly produced in-house, you can see the copper kettles etc.5 or 6 beers on the permanent menu and 2 to 3 special seasonal beers on offer. All of them are simply delicious!The only reason that I give 4 instead of 5 points is that they recently reduced their food menu, making it easier for the kitchen. The previous menu was really better, although the new one is not bad.Closed on Monday, opens every evening at 7pm.",Pivo brewery
50,Every selection of either beer or food is very tasty. It is a very good option for a night with a very good company.,Pivo brewery
50,"A lovely set-up in the old part of Nicosia,a renovated house with a hidden inner yard.Excellent selection of beers and great food!!",Pivo brewery
50,"It's a real pleasure to visit this place. Great beer (something for every taste), plus some pretty decent food. The staff is very friendly and helpful in case you're not sure about what to order. The prices are admittedly not the lowest, but the beer is just amazing.",Pivo brewery
30,"I went to this place with a friend who is a beer enthusiast. I had visited in the past 4 times, with the last time being 7-8 months ago. The beer is great and the owners deserve credit for producing such a rare (for Cyprus at least) product, i.e. hand-crafted beer. However, I was surprised to see that they have applied price increases across the board. Beer prices have been increased by 1 euro. You used to get a 0.4-litre pint (not 0.5 litre which is the standard size for a pint) for 4 euros and they made it 5 euros. The prices for all the dishes (or at least most of them) on the food menu have also been increased. I remember the sausage platter used to be 13 euros now it is 15 euros, the porkchop was 10 euros, now it is 12 euros, etc. In general, the dishes are not big enough to justify such prices. We ordered the porkchop (12 euros) and the burger (13 euros). The pork chop was good, but the burger was average at best. We both agreed that the size of the dishes was average to small. We ordered a few different beers and we were impressed with the quality.Overall the price increases have considerably damaged the appeal of the place. I would say it is still a good place to go for a drink, but I would not recommend it for dinner. 2 (0.4-litre) beers and a main dish (which may not be enough to satisfy your appetite) and you are already above the 20 euro mark. Value for money of the place has been considerably reduced.",Pivo brewery
50,Absolutely amazing place to go for top quality beer. Czech style beer and lovely food. Perfectly clean and look-aftered restaurant . Owners are extremely professional & friendly. Some of them are speaking many languages including fluent Czech! üëåüèºService just exceptional!!!Best place in Cyprus !Dekujeme üá®üáæüá®üáø,Pivo brewery
50,"In the old part of the city, hidden in a maze of narrow roads there is this absolutely amazing place that, should you be in Nicosia, you MUST visit: refreshingly different, decorated in a simple, ‚Äònot in your face‚Äô layout, you will be served amazing drinks and wonderful food... do away with the bottled and canned beers you are used to ... try their own and be amazed! A guaranteed memorable visit that you will want to repeat over and over again.",Pivo brewery
50,"Lovely place, lovely owners, lovely staff, lovely food and the best craft beer in Cyprus.They are master brewers and elaborate the beer using traditional Czech methods. If you are a beer lover, you can not skip this visit. If not... The platter of Bavarian sausages and the Seafood risotto are excellent :)",Pivo brewery
50,Fantastic place!very tastefull beers!!I recommend it for sure!!the staff and the brothers who have this wonderful microbrewery were very polite and helpful!I recommend it for sure!,Pivo brewery
50,"Still my favorite place to dine. Can‚Äôt find anything to fault. Food, service, beer, all excellent. Nice decor and clean. Music that I like. I just love it !",Pivo brewery
50,"A great place to visit food platers rich and tasty but the most exiting is to try all the variety of beers they produce over there.Service is very good and the waitress polite, price is also quite ok.",Pivo brewery
50,Words are meaningless for this place. The owners are awesome. The stuff is very friendly and helpull. The knowledge and details of each and every beer from the guys is amazing. Perfect atmosphere with blues playing in the background and their fantastic food is an unresistable combination. Definitely recommend.,Pivo brewery
50,"One of the best places to go out with friends in Nicosia !Nice place ,friendly service ,good food ! The music was very good ,not too loud !We drank wine but next time we will try beers.We enjoyed it and we will definitely visit again!",Pivo brewery

50,"One of the best places to go in Old Nicosia, really good decoration and atmosphere. Great selection of food and beers.",Pivo brewery
50,Excellent beer brewed by the owners with all their love!! Very nice atmosphere and salads!!definitely visit!!,Pivo brewery
50,Beautiful and nicely decorated place. The beer they produce is awesome and the food delicious. The staff are kind and helpful. The best place for quality beer.,Pivo brewery
50,"This is a local microbrewery with a very nice and calm atmosphere in a rennovated old mansion. Spacious and comfortable, great music selection (blues & rock), with very helpful staff, offers a selection of their own beers and a limited - but delicious - variety of dishes.",Pivo brewery
50,Had a great meal here and grown up son and husband did the beer tasting. They thought each beer tasted was very good.The food - bbq ribs and a cheese & bacon burger - delicious and tasty. How can chips taste so good?,Pivo brewery
50,"Cosy place, excellent service, tasty 'home made' beer and platters !Reservation is recommended, especially at the weekend!",Pivo brewery
40,"Small but interesting selection of beers, good service and nice food.Very cosy atmosphere hiding in the heart of the city.",Pivo brewery
40,Found the taste of beer very interesting and well done to the guys who devoted themselves in this business venture. Not easy task !! The owners are very happy to give a free tour and explain the brewing process.,Pivo brewery
40,"Relaxing, Comfortable and friendly environment. Tasty dishes especially their kotsi. Service was fair but not exceptional.",Pivo brewery
30,"Food is amazing, except from the vegetarian dishes which are bland and tasteless. One could go for anything, even the sausage dish is quite good!The downside is that it being a microbrewery, one would expect better beers; they haven't yet achieved balance of taste and fragrance, bittereness is still overpowering and certain infusions end up imparting more taste than odour which usually leaves bitter and dry afternotes.",Pivo brewery
50,"Out of the way but well worth a visit. All the beers are great and the owners are happy to talk about the making of it. Food menu is relatively small but the actual quality of the food is excellent. One of the few places in Cyprus to get craft beer, good food and a great atmosphere.",Pivo brewery
40,"Been there on a few occasions in the last year and food quality has always been good. Had the risotto and the pork shunk which were both very well cooked and tasty. The beer is brewed by the owners and there are four different kinds, all good if you are into beer.",Pivo brewery
50,"An old city building transformed into a brewery on one side, and a beer house on the other, with no walls in between!",Pivo brewery
40,"Great location as it is just in the heart of Nicosia town, very closed to Ledras street and Panagia Faneromeni church. Has excellent Beer and tasty food, is a nicely decorated and clean place, great atmosphere, excellent service and very good prices.We shall go again and again !",Pivo brewery
50,Right near the green line. Lovely and professional staff. A must visit for beer lovers. The only micro brewery in Cyprus.,Pivo brewery
50,A hidden gem near the green line. The handcrafted beers are wonderful and every week they have a different special beer so i suggest you try that as well. The food is always well cooked and tasteful and the environment is cozy and relaxing! Highly recommended if you are in Nicosia and love beer and good food,Pivo brewery
50,"Well talked about microbrewery, just on the green line..Several beers were tasted and they were all lovely!Ales and lagers were tasty, the staff were polite helpful and smiling, and the 'meze' of sausages and ribs did help with those beers!Great spot, and would certainly visit again!",Pivo brewery
50,"Chances upon this place, and was given a quick guided tour, even though it was outside visiting hours. These guys are passionate and know their stuff. The inner courtyard is perfect for enjoying their delicious beers.",Pivo brewery
40,"Tried the four beer sampler (20 cl of each for 10 Euro total), as well as the Belgian IPA. I particularly liked the Hoppy, which was an American IPA, as well as the Belgian IPA, which was an interesting style that I wasn't sure was going to work. For the regular beers, the flavors are full, but not super strong and don't really last, which I initially mistook for being watered down, but then I realized that it was intentional, including the decision to keep them at around 4 to 4.5% ABV due to the hot climate. I think that at least some would have seemed overbearing if they were stronger flavored or if the flavors lingered. The beers all had a very clean taste and were very well made.",Pivo brewery
30,"I read really good comments about the beers and food served here. I can't comment on the beer as I'm not a fan, but the food was disappointing. My friend got the veggie tagliatelle and I got the beer-cooked pork: both were nicely cooked but the portions were really small compared to the price. We were both hungry after finishing our food!",Pivo brewery
50,"The only city in the world, which is the capital of two states at once: Nicosia. Accurate exactly five meters from the dividing line is the only micro-brewery in Nicosia with the original name Œ†ŒØŒ≤Œø.Four regular varieties are the Weissen, a dark lager, a hopped-up light red ale (so called Hoppy) and pils. At the time of our visit, there was another extra-stout No Exit and AIPA Antistressful on the tap.Open brewing allows you to monitor the work process.The bar is beautiful - bright and modern. At the same time, there are not all these new-fashioned ""crafting"" elements such as uncouth boards in the interior or, for example, beer in old enamel mugs.Pils - wonderful, has not received such pleasure from light beer for a long time. Weitzen is sweet. The dark lager is not mine at all. Ale - interesting: the aroma of hops is powerful, but bitterness is very small; an excellent balanced.Plus to beer go cookies of spargins with salt.In general, 5 points out of 5.",Pivo brewery
40,The food was really great! The staff was friendly and kind and always willing to help. A cosy atmosphere. The only problem (which does not apply only here) is the parking...But I definitely suggest it!,Pivo brewery
40,"A great place to go with your group. Friendly environment and helpful staff. If you like beers, u should try it!",Pivo brewery
50,"Saturday night out with my friendsExcellent food, tasty and nice flavorsBeers were homemade,Staff was friendly and helpful",Pivo brewery
40,"this is a really cool, cozy, alive and yet relaxing place. food is quite very nice, service is great and don‚Äôt hold back on their locally brewed beer. worths the visit/re-visit",Pivo brewery
50,"There aren't many craft beer venues in the world that are perched on an international border, and there aren't many in beautiful historic buildings. And Pivo might be the only one that is both!When you first walk in it's clear the renovation of this historic building took time and money, and if you sit outside the second thing you'll notice is the incredible archaeological display underfoot in the cozy garden.But let's talk about the great beer brewed onsite. Having just spent a week in beer wilderness (Lebanon, where 99% of sales are a handful of brands owned by the same international conglomerate) I was eager for some classic craft brews. So I tried their Czech-style dark lager and it was great, as was the very flavorful burger with fries to accompany it. While looking around I realized: you are literally 5 meters from the green (dividing) line here in the garden. Truly astonishing. Plus the service was great.",Pivo brewery
50,If you are looking for a small cosy place to spend a quiet evening with friends then this is the right place. Excellent food and service with freshly brewed beer at very reasonable prices. Highly recommended.,Pivo brewery
50,"A true gem of a place , staff are very friendly and attentive , food was cooked to perfection , and some very nice beers on sale especially an excellent Czech noir which went down very well , if you like real beers this place is the place to be",Pivo brewery
50,"Spotted this before we travelled to Cyprus. From the surrounding area I was mot expecting too much ... Well how mistaken was I . This place right on the edge of the buffer zone is a shining light. Great work mixing old and new , great decor! Coppers on site good choice of ales , try the four tasting crate! Soon there will be Graham on using KENT hops !! Excellent service from knowledgeable waiting staff . It dies get busy so book. Oh they do food as well!!",Pivo brewery
30,"BeerThey brew their own beer and it's, on average, pretty good. Certainly worth a try. There're a couple of beers they haven't nailed their balance and taste profile, yet; a bit light, sour or bitter, especially on aftertaste.FoodAmazingly good. Except from the veg pasta and the veg pizza, very flat and uninteresting taste, although they're still edible!ServiceBrilliant except from Friday and Saturday nights. Pity, as it both subtracts from the experience and causing them lost revenue. They lack organisation.PriceIt's not cheap but if you go on a week day, get a good beer and avoid the veg dishes, it's well worth it.",Pivo brewery
40,Nice restaurant and very pleasant to be!The bear was terrifically good! Amazing and well done portions !!!,Pivo brewery
50,"a limited menu offering, but of great quality and well cooked. we love the yard and the restored building on the green line. always fun to discover the seasonal beer which is brewed in the premises. service is friendly with a smile, never left unattended.a favorite when down town nicosia.",Pivo brewery
50,"Very nice and cosy place, with few selection of beers and food. We had the sausage platter which was very tasteful. Next time we'll have a proper dinner since everything looked delicious! Good service too ( sometimes too keen to collect our glasses but that's ok..) keep it up œÄŒπŒ≤Œø!!!",Pivo brewery
50,"Great microbrewery, food was great especially the burger best I've tasted. Staff were great, buzzing little place with a selection of beers as expected.",Pivo brewery
40,"This is a place to truly enjoy beer. Fresh, original, unbelievable beer !!! I can't recommend a better place for beer aficionados in Cyprus.",Pivo brewery
50,"Pivo is amazing. It is situated in the old town, in a refurbished old classical building and everything about it gives you an Awe feeling. Architecture and interior wise, this is how places in Cyprus should be. The brothers that own Pivo, love their food and their beer, so everything you get off the menu is done with love and attention to it. The beer is made on location and they have some very good IPA amongst their other varieties but always make sure to ask about their seasonal brews. If you love beer and good food this is your home away from home. Make sure to reserve, especially for weekends.",Pivo brewery
50,"For the first time I've tried their beer and also a goat cheese salad.. Both was awesome! So I have to come again and try another type of beer.. :D And it was even much better! Good music, great atmosphere, nice stuff :))",Pivo brewery
50,"We have been here several times and have had a good time on each occasion. The decor is very cosy and stylish - a converted old building with microbrewery within. There are often special brews on offer and the beer is different from other places. The good menu has everything from cheese platters to full blown plates, and the music is well chosen at just the right volume for conversation.",Pivo brewery
50,"I went to Pivo microbrewery with friends last week and we tried all types of beer that they make there and they were of excellent quality. The staff was very nice and welcoming. They also have airconditioning and a great atmosphere, what is exactly needed in hot days in July!I will definitely visit again and it is of course highly recommended!",Pivo brewery
50,"This bar war recommended by a couple chatting poolside at the Hilton Park, so my son and I decided to give it a try.Firstly, ask the taxi driver to drop you close. The Microbrewery is a fabulously modernised building, but the street it's in is not so.Secondly, try each of the beers. They do a sampling portion so we did that, picked our favourite, then ordered food. I'd read that this was the passion of four brothers, and right enough, they were all there, chatting with the customers - they are really knowledgeable and proud of their beer so talk to them and find out more!My son and I had burgers which were stacked high and accompanied by Rosemary chips - very good and large portions.If you fancy a burger and beer night in Nicosia I'd recommend this place should be high on your list.",Pivo brewery
50,"If you have an interest in beer and start your own microbrewery it would not be surprising if you put all your attention on the brewing. You might offer food but not think it was that important. You would need staff but the beer would be the big thing. Pivo do produce great beer and that might be enough for you, but they also deliver good food - a step up from just a kebab or two - and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly and organised. I was only able to try two of the beers, but we have booked for tonight and intend to try two more ... and the burger my wife said was fantastic. Oh and did I mention the lovely restored building and the charming courtyard?",Pivo brewery
40,Had to ask for directions but loved it when we eventually found it! Enjoyed drinks outside in the terrace the staff very nice with lots of great tips & descriptions on the beers. Lots of tables reserved but it was a Saturday night. Didn't eat but the food looked & smelled yummy. Only open from 7pm but definitely a must if in Nicosia overnight & enjoy real ale. The white wine was very good as well.,Pivo brewery
50,Definitely worth a visit while in Nicosia. I recommend their ribs and Noir beer. It can be busy on weekends so it is best to get a reservation.,Pivo brewery
50,"Nice atmosphere,knowledgeable and helpful waitresses,very tasty beer and great food ( try the spinach salad ) A must try if u visit Nicosia.",Pivo brewery
50,"This was one of my favorite places in Nikosia. We stumbled upon it while exploring the buffer zone in Nikosia. The beer was amazing and very innovative and the location is amazing. Their courtyard is directly adjacent to the buffer zone, which makes it really interesting at night. Definitely a place I will come back to next time in on Nikosia.",Pivo brewery
50,"My daughter and I passed Pivo Microbrewery while we were on a Segway Station Cyprus tour and we marked it's location down so we could stop by during operating hours. We were glad we did. This establishment -- founded by four brothers -- is a gem located in the nooks and crannies of old town Nicosia. They serve they craft beers draught only, and there is a nice selection from which to choose, including seasonal specials. Pivo offers a varied menu, too. I am vegan and found a delicious salad and tasty herbed fries to be a perfect accompaniment to the Noir stout. Pivo is closed Sunday and Monday. It opens at 7pm, which is a good time to arrive since it is a popular place and tables become harder to come by as the evening wears on. They sell beer glasses (ranging in price from 8-13 Euros), ceramic coasters and a few t-shirts, for those looking for souvenirs. Highly recommended for those appreciating a craft beer and pleasant evening.",Pivo brewery
50,"Pivo Microbrewery which had an inviting interior and some great beer. I got the sampler that came in a basket with four half-pints (stout, pilsner, weizen, and an IPA) which were all fantastic.",Pivo brewery
50,"I visited Pivo Microbrewery in Nicosia, for first time, last night. Very nice place. Excelent service and beers.Very friendly staff and very tasty food.I like it! Now is one from my most favorite places in Nicosia.",Pivo brewery
40,"I've visited a few microbreweries in my life and i have to say that this one does not disappoint.The produce 4 beers all year long and a couple seasonal. My opinion is that the wheat beer is the best. It reminds of a Franziskaner-Erdinger combination.Not a vast selection of food on the menu but just enough. What ever we ordered was ok, nothing fancy but good quality and fresh and nicely presented.Staff were very helpful. It was very nice that indoor seating was free of smoke. Difficult to find somewhere in Nicosia these days for non smokers.Recommended.",Pivo brewery
50,"We were recommended to go here having been on the Segway tour earlier. The sign hanging over the single green door says micro brewery. It is situated amongst the labyrinth of streets and side streets that makes up the character of Nicosia, once found, beer heaven awaits. The single entrance door does not prepare you for the surprising interior. This is a real life Tardis. The mind can't reconcile having walked through a terraced house front door which then opens up to a palacios interior, several rooms and a massive outside eating area. Then, having got over the vastness of this establishment, we turned to the craft beer. Quality costs, and this beer is a tad more expensive than the local brew, but a good selection of well thought out beers mean that that little extra euro is worth it. Two special beers for the month added to the five regulars, what's not to like about this micro brewery? The young owners have invested a lot if time effort and money in setting up the establishment. Make your way there and be amazed. Cheers",Pivo brewery
50,Real locally brewed beer. I liked the special dark ale on the occasion of St. Patrick. Very nice platters to share. Excellent the sausages. Great waiters and waitresses :-),Pivo brewery
50,"In my opinion, one of the best places in Nicosia! The place is simply great with cozy atmosphere, serving delicious food and a great variety of beers at reasonable prices. Excellent and super friendly staff.",Pivo brewery
40,Have been to Pivo 3 times now. They have a range of very good beers. I especially like the dark beers. Such a mellow taste. The atmosphere is also good. I would recommend it.,Pivo brewery
50,"This is an excellent place and there is nothing that compares in Nicosia.first it is a proper microbrewery serving really good beers. Second the food is just right, perfectly suited to the beer. Third the atmosphere and ambience is as close to perfection as it's possible to get. Fourth the staff are friendly, welcoming and knowledgable. Last but not least is the building, tastefully refurbished and the location within yards of the green line. Paradise for the discerning beer drinker.",Pivo brewery
50,"This was our first visit to Pivo and it was a super one!Wonderful setting within the old Nicosia area and a very warm atmosphere. Friendly and helpful staff explained all details about the various beer options, making the experience educational as well as enjoyable üòä.We were also very impressed with how accommodating the staff were regarding our food choices, going out of their way to deliver what was a great food experience. Highly recommend the vegetable rissoto!Finally, Dolly - one of the strongest in alcohol beers - was exquisite (and quite strong at 7 degrees....).All in all, a great and romantic evening out which left us with the best of impressions.Will certainly be going back!",Pivo brewery
50,"Food was served on time and hot, great taste. Staff is very friendly and eager to help. Highly recommended.",Pivo brewery
50,"A very nice place with cosy atmosphere, friendly staff ready to explain the special beers they create themselves and nice music. We really enjoyed their special beers and something to noble!!",Pivo brewery
50,"Nice place, with great beers and food.we tried the beers and the food of the night and we loved it.Pricewise is correct.staff was very friendly.",Pivo brewery
40,Go for the flight of different beers to taste all 4 varieties. Food is OK but the whole experience of a custom brew gives the place some of its attractiveness. What's lacking is the view of the brewery and a personal touch,Pivo brewery
30,"It's a nice building but nothing more. The beers are very disappointing and there no atmosphere in the place. Staff could be more helpful and respectful for the customers. I went once and that's enough.... if you want to enjoy beer, just go some where else.",Pivo brewery
40,We visit the place at a Sunday night. Nice smooth relaxing atmosphere. Helpful waiting staff and tasty beers. Over 6 different well home produced beers were available. Tasted them all. Totally recommended,Pivo brewery
40,"Of course the best beer in Cyprus,but the other menu...))They have to work on it!)But yellow couches are so cozy!Very tasty ""anti stress "" beer,highly recommend!",Pivo brewery
50,Second time to Pivo. Most excellent the beer they make.Our German friends love the beer.Bitter beer lovers will love the place.We ordered sausages just to begin with.Most of them nice and fresh.Locally made by a German guy from Limassol. Food excellent. Rips and jambono recommended. Staff very kind and prompt to serve you.Environment the most.Renovated building in the centre of the old city just by buffer zone and the occupied areas. Reasonable prices and good quality.,Pivo brewery
50,"Everything was great!Friendly staff, very good service, excellent food and inhouse made beers. Highly recommended!!",Pivo brewery
50,"The beer 'Pivo' is a product of the place itself. they have only 4 beers in the menu - but it's MORE than enough!The beers are very good and all 4 of them gives different taste for different people's taste.The food is also very good. comes in big dishes and nice presented on the plates.This is a place of beer, friends and a good ol' blues and rock in the background (not loud, sust the exact volume to have a good conversation).The have sometime a temporary special beer - for christmas they brewed a burned christmas tree flavour beer - nice and tingling on the tongue, bit bitter with sweetness.Also its a good place for a date, romantic but also simple.*** needs to reserve a table at least couple of days ahead.",Pivo brewery
50,"We just loved this place!Excellent and friendly staff. Owners of the brewery were more than happy to explain us how they are making the beers.We also had dinner, and all of our dishes was well cooked and tasty.Even If I'm not beer lover, I really like this place and we are totally getting back for another perfect night out !",Pivo brewery
50,"The whole microbrewery concept is great. And the setting is lovely. Ideal for beer & wine lovers alike, friends & lovers alike! Interesting dishes and friendly staff!",Pivo brewery
50,"A unique place in Nicosia with very friendly staff and great drinking choices. It's location is very convenient, in old city and close to parking and other bars. The decoration and the atmosphere are perfect.",Pivo brewery
50,This place was recommended to us by our segway tour guide. It really is a great place to stop and have a drink especially if you like beer! The food looked great although we are yet to sample any. We will be sure to stop again when we are next in Nicosia.,Pivo brewery
50,"Pivo is a restaurant that you won't regret going to. I liked the fact that everything is made there from their own materials. The food is very good and the beer is exceptional. I found it a bit overpriced though, but just a little. The thing I would give the most credits to, is the staff which provide a perfect overall experience.",Pivo brewery
50,"Pivo is a fantastic microbrewery, people working there are always with a smile and keen to help you out. The atmosphere is really cosy, there is a nice selection of beers and the plates we tasted were extremely good. Finally I would say the prices were logical. So overall Pivo is certainly a place worth visiting and I hope they keep up the quality of their services!!!!!!!!",Pivo brewery
50,"This is how restaurants should be set up. Limited menu choice but outstanding quality, owners running it with attention to detail.",Pivo brewery
50,"This place is just awesome! Reasonable price, very cosy and warm place, very friendly staff plus every month they surprise you and actually amaze you with the offer for the beer of the month! You rock Pivo ...",Pivo brewery
50,"I have been to Pivo twice in less than a month, with friends, and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. A lot of attention has been taken in all aspects of the experience, in addition to the obvious - the beer - and I could not fault it in any way! Excellent food (from the burgers to the ribs and the pork leg!!), in plentyful quantities, friendly staff (unobtrusive but always around) in a very well decorated environment (a restored old house and inner courtyard), beautiful beer glasses and of course, you are welcome to have a tour and talk beer all night. The owners are always happy to oblige!! time flies when you're having enjoying yourself with good company.",Pivo brewery
50,"Off the beaten tourist trail next to the demarcation zone, this wonderful watering hole is well worth seeking out. Entering the premises one feels as though you have found an oasis in the desert of urban decay.Popular with young Cypriots, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. Four beers are brewed on the premises. Each beer is unique and worthy of praise and more importantly taste.",Pivo brewery
50,"This welcoming restaurant / bar / microbrewery resides in a renovated house with courtyard in Old Nicosia very near the Green Line and close to Phaneromeni Square. The food was very good, the service excellent and the beers sublime. We each chose different ones and everyone was delighted. The atmosphere in the courtyard was also excellent and the three(?) owners of the brewery were happy to chat and show us the workings of the vats etc. Top marks!",Pivo brewery
50,"I highly recommend doing the beertasting, the 4 presented beers are each unique in taste. The guys who own the bar are engineers who went abroad to learn about beer brewing across Europe, with them they have brought techniques and added their own style and flavors to the beers. I was happy to learn that each week they make a new flavoured 5th beer and that they have made Belgian styled beers as well. The only thing missing I felt was something for the ladies, I know not everyone loves the taste of beer, so having a fruity/cidery beer as an alternative would have been nice. The location is perfect, classy, calm and it has some ancient ruins you can see through a window in the floor. Perfect place to chill out and talk with friends",Pivo brewery
50,"Already been quite a few times, this little gem of a restaurant/brewery will keep me returning for the food and ambience of the whole place (old historic city house, renovated perfectly to create an informal and unpretentious space of a few rooms and outer yard), and one doesn't even have to be a beer drinker to enjoy all else. Overall it's a great experience well worth visiting with friends or as couples.",Pivo brewery
50,We really enjoyed it! We had great time with friends! Very friendly waiters..fast service! You can enjoy homemade beers..of all tastes! If you are a beer lover..you should try it! Reasonable food prices.,Pivo brewery
40,"Very nice place, very nice atmosphere. Small problem with parking but Phaneromenis Municipal Parking is 100 meters away. The prices for food are a little expensive.",Pivo brewery
50,"This can be difficult to find as it is away from many of the other bars and restaurants but is just a short walk from the main pedestrian strip running through the centre of the Nicosia into the North part.As far as I have seen, there is nothing like this in Cyprus and is a great little place to spend your evening. The house beers are very nice and I would recommended trying at least Hoppy, if not all of them! They have a guest beers at different times too.Unfortunately, we did not eat here as we had made other plans but the food looked simple and very delicious, in particular the Sausage Platter.If you are visiting Nicosia you must visit Pivo.",Pivo brewery
50,"Been many times and each time I have had great food, excellent ales and friendly efficient service.The owners of Pivo are approachable and explain all about the process of making the ale as well as the differences between them.The food is excellent with some specials most nights.If you love your ale/beer then this is the place to try in old Nicosia.",Pivo brewery
50,"I happened to walk past as one of the owners was unloading some supplies and saw the microbrewery sign. As I am into brewing I asked him about the place. He told me it opened at 7 so I came back. I was on my own so didn't try the food but the beer was GREAT. They are brewing as you drink/dine so you really understand how fresh the beer is. It's also a fantastic building, very tastefully renovated and a great atmosphere.Love it!",Pivo brewery
50,"Hi, I have took a dinner yetserday evening at this Nice restaurant with few frends. We enjoyed the food and all 4 types of the beer. The place offers you a ""Taste"" - all 4 types of the beers they have (200ml)/each for only 8 euro. We loked also the service and atmosthere. For sure you have to visit it once you arrive in Nicosia. Also, it's at the border with Turkey side wall :).",Pivo brewery
50,"Delightful beers, wonderful service and the food is great. You can see the brewing process here and have a great chat with the brewers. Totally beautiful place.",Pivo brewery
40,Excellent home brewed beer. Food is good. Kotsi is the pick of the menu - when available (even though it is a bit pricy). Avoid the burgers.,Pivo brewery
50,Beer is not a usual bevarage that one finds in a back street of a historical city in Cyprus. Outside the major breweries now there is a small group of breweries crafting specialised beers. Pivo Microbrewery in the central of the Cyprus capital is a brilliant contemporary dining concept that fits well in the restored centre of old Nicosia. Superb German styled wheat or blonde beer can be drunk with a well thought out cuisine. However I would prefer the traditional Cypriot peanuts to nachos. The peanuts were introduced to Cyprus from Egypt in the twentieth century. Excellent and attentive service. They‚Äôll even put down the music if you went there for a friendly chat. Highly recommend it.,Pivo brewery
40,"Great place (architecture / ambiance), suitable for friendly nights out but also bigger gatherings. Their weissbier was truly great (2.5euro for half pint, 4euro the pint). Their porkchops (10euro) were very well made and priced. Their schnitzel needs some more fine-tunning (and less salt).You might need to book a table in advance if you want to sit at the internal courtyard.",Pivo brewery
50,"Bad news for beer lovers: beer in Cyprus is not good (to put it nicely). Good news for beer lovers: there's a place in old Nicosia called Pivo Microbrewery. The place offers 4 different beers and all of them are heavenly. My personal favourite is Berliner Weisse (I think that's the name). They also serve quality food to accompany your drink but they will be happy to have you even if you are visiting for drinks only.The service is very friendly.The place itself is something like a fashionable bar and a simplistic pub joined together. It is not a typical cypriot place at all. When it is busy, you may have to share a table with some other guests. This adds some bierhalle spice to the atmosphere.I highly recommend this place if you are after quality beer and somewhat non-typical atmosphere.",Pivo brewery
50,Great place. Great atmosphere. Great food. Great beer. Great service. My food was cooked to perfection and the beer kept coming.,Pivo brewery
50,"For those of you who want a break from the Keo, this is the place to come. Their four regular beers are solid and their special is worth a look at.We had the four beer taster, followed by two large beers and some keftedakia (little meatballs). The beer was great and so was the food.It is also located on the Green Line in an old house, so it is very atmospheric too. The servers are all really great too.",Pivo brewery
50,"Very excellent place with great beer. The food is good,the stuff is very friendly! My favorites beer is now Blonde and noir and sitarenia. The localization is in old town of Nicosia.",Pivo brewery
50,"Really great place (not only) for beer lovers. The staff is very helpful, even in busy hours. The beer the guys make is really tasty and great idea to make always one special beer.Price coresponds to the quality of the beer.And also the coffee is great, long time didn't have such a good espresso (yeah, the price is not like for a sketo in a village, but you get what you pay for).",Pivo brewery
40,We decided to try this relatively new place in old area of Nicosia city to have some time for discussion and beer..although it was crowded food had very good quality considering that this place is for beer. There's no big variety of plates but it was really nice and prices normal. Also home made beer is offered with a special different recipe every week depending on the brewery process..it's something different but worths to try it and support such efforts..inside or outside sitting is available..We notified one of the directors that they were a bit late to serve the beer but he kindly explained the reason for that day..I hope they keep trying their best and maintain such a place in the city..I would recommend the place for couples and small companies..make your reservation to avoid disappointment..,Pivo brewery
50,"Can here with a group of colleagues from all around Europe and everybody was excited and left with the best impressions. The staff is very helpful and ready to help you. The beer quality is very nice. Also, if you ask one of the staff will give a short guide to the microbrewery and explain you how they make beer.",Pivo brewery
50,Very nice place in the old nicosia!! The food is very good and tasty especially the hamburger!! They make their own beer and is really good! Also has a part with glass floor and the decoration is very beautiful! The waiter was kind and with helpful advise for the food!,Pivo brewery
40,"An old renovated house with excellent architecture and simple but nice decoration,in the heart of the old town of Nicosia. Authentic Beer made by Pivo brewery, nice dishes that we all shared. We tried blondy, black and sitarenia. I liked blondy beer and the three dishes we tried were delicious. From Sussages I liked the spicy one, different kinds of good cheese and meet balls that were excellent !!! There is achoice of salads as well and some other dishes.Very good service, helpful stuff and reasonable prices. Beer about 3.5 euro and each plate about 13 euro. We will go again !Pivo MicrobrewerPivo Microbrewery",Pivo brewery
50,"Very buzzy cool place. Excellent choice of beers and wines. Big portions of foods,ideal for sharing,all good. Gets very busy in evenings so book esp if there's a few of you. Service very friendly and attentive,a common theme in Nicosia.",Pivo brewery
40,It was a nice touch the beer tasting option! I really enjoyed the cheese plater and the calming music. Definetly going back,Pivo brewery
50,"I'm happy to see that this place is going so well. Whenever we call they are already fully booked, but we are lucky to get their last small table (they do keep a few tables for walk-ins from my understanding). Their staff is so friendly and welcoming, you can tell they are happy to be there! The place is nicely restored and set up, with a nice atmosphere. I enjoyed all the beers I have tried the few times I have visited, but I do remember their smoked beer quite vividly and I am sorry that I only got to have it once before it sold out. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food! So far I have tried the curry veggie risotto, the veggie tagliatelle, and the seafood risotto. The seafood risotto blew me away! I also really like their ""beer-bread"" that they serve with the beer. We will be coming back!",Pivo brewery
50,First time we went there. They brew their own beers very tasty. The food incredible especially thete burgers. Will defenatly be going back.,Pivo brewery
50,"I have been hearing good comments about this place for some time now. Last night we got to visit with some friends. We were definitely not disappointed. The brewery/restaurant is located in a recently renovated beautiful house in old Nicosia (within the Venetian walls). Furniture and wall fittings very tasteful. The small back yard was very cozy. Mixed crowd, young and older. We had the house burger which was very good, the fries excellent. The service was excellent and we all enjoyed Blondie one of the beers they produce on the premises. We even got a small tour of the brewery from one of the owners! We are definitely going back.",Pivo brewery
50,An old house in the old part of Nicosia which has been converted to a brewery. Three brothers and a cousin as the young men have told us who like beer and decided to created their own brand. They produce beer on the premises. They have four flavours all very very tasty. The four young men have renovated the house with great taste having kept the character of the old city. Their idea to produce their own beer has paid off as they have done an excellent job in all respect. They also have some dishes if you are hungry. Atmosphere and service are great. Highly recommended.,Pivo brewery
40,This is an informal but well designed beer house. There is a patio that has been incorporated and it makes a very pleasant place to have an informal beer with food. The beer is fine (not great) but the overall experience was positive. Great staff!,Pivo brewery
50,The place is highly recommended for various reasons:1/ Building with the internal garden2/ Excellent service3/ Friendly staff4/ Excellent house beers5/ Ambience,Pivo brewery
50,"I went there with colleagues after work. Although not a big fun of beers, i was amazed by the unique flavor of the homemade beers this place offers. We also tried the food and it was great. The service was excellent. I will definitely visit the place again. I only wish they opened earlier so we could visit the place every Thursday after work!",Pivo brewery
40,"Very spacious, popular, lively and refined place with exquisite choice of beers. Nice terrace as well. Very good service.",Pivo brewery
50,"They are trying really hard, both beer and food good. Service, ambience and food would not be out of place in central london - really great and knowledgeable guy served us. Worth going, and worth supporting.",Pivo brewery
50,"the beer is fresh and nice, they look very experienced in what they do, food is great too and they serve natural cypriot fried potatoes which are hardly found i. restaurants anymore, the place has ambience and overall the four brothers who run it are doing a great job",Pivo brewery
40,Interesting place for a casual outing.Thied all kinds of beers but really loved the blond one.The platter of sausages was really nice...overall a nice choice to go out.,Pivo brewery
50,"One of my favourite places in Nicosia! Although serving only their homemade beers (and a limited range of other alchoholic drinks) it does not lack anything compared to other beer houses. The food is also good, with several choices and seasonal special dishes. I like the cosy atmoshpere, the small back yard, the mixture of people of all ages, and of course the low prices which are always a plus. However, what I love the most is their great service! The waiters (some of them are also the owners) constantly have a huge smile on their faces and are more than willing to offer their guest a pleasant night!!",Pivo brewery
50,"I visited P√≠vo because I finally wanted really good beer and I wasn't disappointed. Plus I could talk in czech for a little bit which was nice. I really liked all the beers, but of course, Blondie (bohemian pilsner) speaks to my czech nature the most...There was a lot of small children on Sunday lunch time, but in the evening is atmosphere always very nice...",Pivo brewery
50,"The brewery and it's bar/restaurant are situated in a back street and you will need a map to find it, but the effort is certainly worthwhile. A range of four core beers are served which represent the world of great beer styles: a Bohemian pilsner, a Bavarian weissbier, a Czech dark lager and an American IPA. A further beer changes regularly. At the time of my visit the featured brew was a Belgian abbey-style beer, rich and fruity. I didn't eat, but the food looked delicious, and the surroundings both in the bar/restaurant and in the rear courtyard were very pleasant. If you like beer, this is a 'must' during your visit to Lefkosia/Nicosia.",Pivo brewery
50,"I had heard from friends about this new initiative. A microbrewery in the heart of the old town. Tucked into a little street, one does not know what to expected. Once you step into the place, you will be amazed. A beautiful courtyard. A cosy interior. Old and modern at the same time. As for the beers, you can go any way you want. Blondie, Noir... maybe try a Special! Food is nice and interesting. You can find sausages as one would expect. But also a Gorgonzola salad with apples and red berries. I am definitely going back for more!",Pivo brewery
40,"4 brothers with a passion for beer recently opened this microbrewery. The building is nicely renovated. They have 4 beers all year round (Pilsner, Black Lager, Weizen and IPA) and one beer of the month. I spoke with one of the brewers and he told me that they are trying to brew a Belgian Style Triple, my favorite kind of beer. On my next trip to Nicosia, I will go there again.",Pivo brewery
40,A nice micro brewery in Nicosia with lovely hand crafted beers. Amazing aroma and rich flavors of fruits and herbs. Great place to visit,Pivo brewery
40,Excellent set up. The people were enthusiastic the food - sausages and cheese platters - was well served and tasteful. The beers we tried were all good.,Pivo brewery
40,"Visited in Jan 2016, really nice atmosphere and vibe, with relaxing music and setup. Tried the Weiss (wheat) beer and the IPO, felt lighter than expected. Service was great and the food was good, but not exceptional. Would gladly visit again and try more beers, really have high hopes for this place and am very supportive of the idea of microbreweries in Nicosia.",Pivo brewery
50,"Excellent Beer 4 varieties: Blondie, Noir, Hoppy and Sitarenia, the latter being my favourite. There was also a seasonal one called Graham. Service was very good and polite, food arrived on time. The Pork ""Gonato"" was divine but is only available on weekends or by special order! Will definitely visit again. Venue is also very well renovated.",Pivo brewery
30,"A beautifully converted building in the old city, we sat in the lovely courtyard, which was nicely heated, even in January. It was busy with a nice mix and the girl who served us was lovely. Beer, when it came was great, and it's definitely a good thing to have a microbrewery in Nicosia. So far, so good. The menu though, is small (ok in itself) but dominated by pork dishes. I ordered a burger, since it was pretty much the only thing on the menu that didn't say pork, sadly, one bite told me that it had pork in it. I hailed a passing waiter, who told me that of course it has 20% pork, otherwise it would have been called a beefburger! How stupid of me not to realise that a burger equals pork! I was then left sitting for half an hour with a full plate in front of me, no-one bothered to check back, or offer an alternative. We also left our chips as they were very soggy and greasy.The location, beer and ambiance deserve 4 or 5 stars, but the food and service deserve 1. I would probably go again for a beer, on the way to another restaurant",Pivo brewery
50,This is the best microbrewery in Cyprus. The beer is excellent and the location in the old town is very charming. This is a great place for drinks with friends or co-workers. The owners are usually present at the brewery and are very nice. I would highly recommend Pivo to anyone. It is best to call ahead for reservations as it usually very full.,Pivo brewery
50,"I have visited Pivo Microbrewery last night with some friends and did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the beer was excellent and the food was really good (though the menu is quite limited). It's a unique place, made with love and you can feel it in the air. Will definitely be visiting again soon!",Pivo brewery
40,"Being a huge craft beer enthusiast I was more than delighted to hear that we have our own microbrewery in the heart of the capital. The beers created on location are very interesting and the prices are very moderate. A very stylish bar that makes for a good ""hoppy"" night out especially in the summer because of their beer garden.",Pivo brewery
50,"Great effort from all the people there for the beers and the place... Good job guys, keep on doing it",Pivo brewery
40,This is the very first of its kind in Nicosia. Located in the heart of the old city the only challenge is parking.Some truly great beers brewed in-house and the service is great.The crowd is a good mix and and food (although not a huge choice) is very good. Price is not bad either. For around ‚Ç¨20 peer head and will eat well and have at least 2-3 great beers,Pivo brewery
50,The place is really cosy with logical prices for their beer. The beer is brewed on location. It is maybe the only microbrewery in Nicosia. There is also a small choice of platters and food.,Pivo brewery
