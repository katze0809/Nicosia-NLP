40,"The palace is nice, built in mixture of Bizantine and Venetian style. The building itself is nice and the complex around it is one of the most beautiful parts of Nicosia",Archbishop's Palace
30,"Every now and then you get to a place to look at and wonder why? Because you can't get close nor inside (at least not when we visited) all you see is a fine building. It is a place of historical interest if you know the story of one of it's most notable residents - Archbishop Makarios. There are two vintage state cars behind glass and some important statues. However next door is Agios Ionnas Cathedral which is worth a visit. It is not known to TripAdvisor so I will tell you why in this review. Very small and ordinary looking from outside but go inside. Very colourful, full of gold leaf panels and religious items. Also floor to ceiling frescoes of life of Christ. Unfortunately you can't take photos inside but I have attached one of the building, one of statues and the limos.",Archbishop's Palace
30,"Although the Archbishop is an important figure in Cyprus who has religious and political clout, the palace is just another building which is out of bounds to the public. An interesting Cadillac and MBenz are shown off in a glass garage for those car enthusiasts.",Archbishop's Palace
20,Not open to the public! Looks interesting from the outside but unless you're passing I would not bother as you cannot get up close or inside. I would not class it anything better than ordinary. Next to the small but quaint St John's Cathedral & the Byzantine museum.,Archbishop's Palace
40,"Very nice building, seat of the archbishop. Building started still during the colonial period (1956). Only 5 years later it became ecclesiastical seat of the president (Macharios III). It cannot be visited. Next to it: St. Johns cathedral. A must.",Archbishop's Palace
40,"Although not much to see, I recommend to take a look at the museum and the small church near by. Do not miss to visit the museum Agonos - which is next door to the Archibishop's palace.",Archbishop's Palace
30,"This place can only be admired from outside the gates and I wish more people wrote this here as I was under the impression we could visit it.Also it is difficult to find as there are no directions given coming from Ledra street, so basically you have to ask the locals in Greek 'signomy, pou ine Arhiepiscopi?'The structure of the building is not bad, but whoever said it reminds St Mark's square in Venice needs to go again there to check the difference. Fortunately, since the gates are always close you can visit round the corner the Folk Art Museum and the Byzantine Museum.",Archbishop's Palace
30,Many parts of this have been blocked off to the public. You can still get a reasonable photo if you walk around.,Archbishop's Palace
30,"Not half as beautiful as the former building to the right of the cathedral. Also it had to be rebuilt as a result of the Turkish attack on the building. Nothing of great interest except for the two cars, one given by JF Kennedy.",Archbishop's Palace
30,"This is an impressively large building being the official residence of the Archbishop of Cyprus. Built in neb-byzantine style, the building is beautiful to look at.Unfortunately the palace is not open to the public. So don't go out of your way to visit.",Archbishop's Palace
40,"This is a wonderful looking building is different from many of the other sandstone style architectural buildings and is styled using many types of pastel colouring. Unfortunately it can only be seen from the outside as it's not open to the public. However, you have to take photos from across the street as the building is so wide and close ups can be done by pushing your camera through the large fronted black gates.",Archbishop's Palace
30,"This is a modern palace of little interest since one cannot go inside. However, the replica of JFK's official car was nice to see since they don't make cars like that anymore.",Archbishop's Palace
40,"This Palace is located on the east side of Nicosia, within the historical district, which is located next to the Byzantine Museum & the Folk Museum",Archbishop's Palace
50,"We passed by the palace while looking for Famagusta Gate. Reminded me of San Marco square in Venice. It looks really good and nicely taken care of. Felt a bit too luxurious, though.",Archbishop's Palace
30,Yes it is an impressive building.However I am always sceptical about the head of any church having an imposing building..,Archbishop's Palace
40,This archbishops palace is a must to visit once you are in Nicosia. The structure is superb and the history is stunning,Archbishop's Palace
30,Yes well it looks beautiful and I realise Makarios is the hero of the nation. However is it good spend of funds the limousines in glass cabinet etc. Hmmmm,Archbishop's Palace
40,"It is a very beautiful place and palace, if you don't know the old Nicosie you will need a map to find the palace.",Archbishop's Palace
30,"Historical interest, and what luxury! We couldn't go in but admired the classic cars and the facade.",Archbishop's Palace
30,"With all due respect, I was unimpressed. I lamented the walk in the heat to get to a modern constructed building with notions of grandeur because I was misled by my perception that an Archbishopâ€™s Palace would be a historical gem. Typically it is also off limits to ordinary mortals. Perhaps more through personal bias, but nothing to see here so I moved on regretting my decision to look for it on foot when the car park was still a good distance away.",Archbishop's Palace
40,We did our own walking tour of the sites here.Parked the car in a side street.The Arch Bishops palace was down a side road.It was a Huge Place.Very nice to show the children too.,Archbishop's Palace
20,A nice enough building but surrounded by lovely old Nicosia buildings in desperate need of repair. The contrast is stark.,Archbishop's Palace
40,"For history buffs this area will intigrue, the museum next to the palace is full old art as well as the surrounding buidings tell an architectural story. The is no entry to the palace, however it is definitely worth a photo stop from the gates. There are two of the archbishops official cars on display for car buffs, one is a replica of JFK's official car.",Archbishop's Palace
30,"The 106 degree heat made it difficult to appreciate some of the sights, this one included. It's an impressive building, albeit small, and it was sort of cool to see two of the bishops. I hope for their sake there's A/C in their cloaks.",Archbishop's Palace
40,"This is the modern residence and office of the Archbishop of Cyprus and stands adjacent to St John's Cathedral. It is in the old town part a bit tucked away on the Greek side of the capital of Nicosia. It is a new building constructed near to the older palace and is unfortunately inaccessible to the public. This is a real shame as the building looks very impressive from the outside and a quick look inside would have been extremely interesting. Outside there are some older state cars on show in a glass garage building whilst there is also the statue of Makarios III, who was the first president of Cyprus. It's a good area with attractive buildings but you do have to look for it, as it is a bit tucked away from the busier routes but very much worth a visit if you have time.",Archbishop's Palace
30,We visited the Archbishop's palace on a guided day trip from Paphos. This was our second visit to Nicosia. The place is not open to the public though you can wander around outside .There are some classic cars on display in glass fronted garages and there are other museums near by.The palace is a modern building looking very Venetian it was built in 1960 and rebuilt in 1980 after being nearly destroyed in 1974.You can view the outside when visiting the Byzantine and Folk Art museums.,Archbishop's Palace
40,"Located in the Historical centre of the Old Town of Nicosia, Archbishop's Palace is open for people only the day that Archbishop has his Nameday. But Groups of Tourists visit the place almost everyday as in the yard of Archbishop's Palace, is the 14th century Cathedral of Saint John and the Archbishop Makarios Foundation, a very interesting Byzantine Museum and Art Gallery.Just opposite is the historic Pancyprian Gymnasium with it's Museum and if you walk around you will see many historical buildings and monuments, old small churches, the Walls and Gates and if you keep walking you will be at Laiki Yitonia and the pedestrian streets of Ledras and Onasagorou,full of shops, bars and cafe-restaurants.Really very interesting !",Archbishop's Palace
