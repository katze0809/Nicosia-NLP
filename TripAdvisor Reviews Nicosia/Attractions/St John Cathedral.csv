50,Small church in the complex of Archiepiscopal Palace. Absolutely not to be missed as it has beautifully painted ceiling. Something like Cyprus version of Sistine chapel.,St John Cathedral
50,"Built in the 14th century, this is awonderful byzanthine gate through the history of Cyprus.As the Sistine Chapel of Voronet, Gura Humorului, Romania this chapel has paintings that shows the influence of painters and of their art over the popular Christian mythological…",St John Cathedral

50,"Orthodox in Cyprus are very familiar with this church as it have been televised so many times, so many years.Small but interesting.",St John Cathedral

Church of the archbishop and luxuary places for the ambassador to Greece, the president and his wife. Very nice golden isonostasos.Always many groups to visit this church.",St John Cathedral
30,"This Orthodox church is in Greek part of Cyprus, looking at the sexiest, very beautiful architecture. What's worse, it's hard to catch you when you do it, and when you do not visit, you do not ask anything. When we were, the church was closed. Monday was the day we came.",St John Cathedral
20,"We had driven 2 hours to Nicosia and went immediately to the Tourist information, asked about which sites to visit and then left to make our plans over a quick drink. Meandered through the shops up ledra street, had lunch and then headed for the this, the Byzantium Museum, Archbishops Palace and Famagusta Gate. Got there at 3.20pm only to find this and most other places closed at 3 and did not open again till the morning. Archbishops Palace did not seem to open at all! Tourist information should have told us this and we could of planned accordingly!!!",St John Cathedral
20,"The Cathedral is small but beautiful. No photos allowed which is fine we understand this as many churches have the same rules. However in all the churches we have ever been in they allow you to buy candles and light them for loved ones lost. We did just this, only 30 seconds later to have a member of staff blow them out and replace them into the box so others can 'buy' them again. This deeply upset us as they were lit for loved ones lost. The church is worth visiting and is free.",St John Cathedral
30,"Very small inside. But outside it looks very unique, beautiful, and historical. Maybe some part was not open to the public.",St John Cathedral
40,Well worth a look. Free to enter .great architecture. Very peaceful . Not far from.the other sites on the free map avalible from tourist info,St John Cathedral
50,"You should see this Orthodox church for praying and meditation. Lovely old paintings and icons. Go early, before it's get crowded. Closed in the evening.",St John Cathedral
30,but only from the 18th century. More interesting ones up in the Troodos mountains. One gets the impression that the officials can be full of themselves. Not a pleasant church atmosphere.,St John Cathedral
50,"Just absolutely stunning art work, beautiful, historic and INTACT iconography. Could have stayed for hours just looking.Downside: Very busy place so we were given an allocated time before the next group which was not long enough. No photos allowed, which is quite understandable, but this really lacks any quality books or postcards which would have been useful. managed to get one postcard of the altar but there was so much more!",St John Cathedral
50,"A true example of how the outside deceives the eye. The inside of this church is MAGNIFICENT! Icons, gold leaf everywhere, statues. It is truly breath taking. Go see it & its free. No photos of the inside allowed.",St John Cathedral
50,"This is an old historic church inside the archbishopric's yard. Altough a small church, it is full of treasures and history. The area is nice, you can visit the museum next door too.",St John Cathedral
50,"The cathedral of Nicosia, situated next to Archbishopric of Cyprus, great architecture and very interesting neighbourhood as well",St John Cathedral
30,"This is sort of the cathedral, really rather small. Like many Greek churches it is heavily decorated with wall paintings. The altar area has the usual screen and icons. Pictures are not allowed and tour groups can provide irritating distraction due to modest space. What struck me is that it was nice and worth a stop, but did not seem special, especially since it was surrounded almost by what seemed to be a n ultralavish Archbishops house (palace?). There seemed to be a disconnect.",St John Cathedral
40,This cathedral is set in some very nice grounds and lovely photos can be taken within or from across the street. It is next door to the palace and consists of the usual sandstone style brickwork and large bell tower. Check times of opening as it was closed when I got there and did not have time to go back another day.,St John Cathedral
40,It gets crowded and it is small for a cathedral but it's still worth a visit. It would be hard to avoid on a tour of Nicosia.,St John Cathedral
40,"This Cathedral is located within the Historical district. walking distance from the Byzantine Museum, Folks Art Museum and The Archbishop's Palace",St John Cathedral
40,very nice old church next to the head office of Archbishop in the old town of Nicosia. Especially nice during Easter,St John Cathedral
40,"Entering the small gate, you walk into a complex of several buildings, St. John's cathedral being to the left. Straight on, there is a sort of exhibition centre, which at the time had a school exhibition on in the basement about Cyprus. The cathedral, to the left, inside, was beautiful; the drawings and frescos on the walls were so vibrant and life-like, and very clear and outlined. My favourite one was a dragon that had a huge tongue with drawings on it. Amazing wall paintings. Unfortunately though we weren't allowed to take photos inside. One could only purchase some postcards from the gift shop, and they didn't even have much of a selection. Other than that, wonderful cathedral!",St John Cathedral
30,"Very small but nice from the outside. Unfortunately we could not get in, as it wasn't open at 16.30 on a weekday.Conserning size, it is very noteworthy that the archbishop's palace is at least 10 times as big as the house of God...There is a very good statue at the back of the church however, really worth having a look at (mother with two children).",St John Cathedral
50,Located right next to the Archbishopric Pallace the church is a jewel of religious history and old paintings and icons,St John Cathedral
50,"Ayios Ioannis is the the seat of the Orthodox Archbishopric in Cyprus. It was a monastery until the 18th century. The church has a modest exterior that was required by Ottoman rule, but an impressive interior with gilded woodwork and crystal chandeliers. Covered in gold leaf, the woodcarving is in the best tradition of 18th century Cypriot craftsmanship, and it remains the only church in Lefkosia in which the whole of the internal Frescoes have survived in their entirety.A must visit!",St John Cathedral
20,"Somehow you expect this to be magnificent - a holy place with recent history; a centre for people to come together, but it is very underwhelming. Inside it is naturally full of icons and images. It has all the trappings but is so small. The Archbishop's Palace next door is huge and magnificent; it feels as if the principles are the wrong way round.Very disappointed when inside for some scruffy jobsworth to come into the cathedral telling everyone no pictures and then going to the place where supplicants have lit their candles, made their offering and prayer and simply pulls out all the lit candles and blows them out before putting them in the bin underneath. Souless and tactless.Finding the place is a challenge in itself as is finding the old town area - poorly signposted.",St John Cathedral
50,Easter is a perfect time to visit this very old churc which is in fact in the Yard of the building of the Archbishopric of Cyprus and next to a number of museums of this area.,St John Cathedral
40,A small but particularly beautiful church. The iconography is stunning and of great historical importance. Well worth a visit.,St John Cathedral
50,"The outside is like so many other churches, but the inside is completely different, and so unexpected. Amazing frescos all over the walls and ceiling. You are not allowed to take photos inside, unfortunately. This church is well worth visiting.",St John Cathedral
30,"Just next to Arcibishop Palace, opposite the well known and historical 1st High School of Nicosia, the Pancyprian Gymnasium, where Makarios himself was a student. Very crowdy at 28th of October and 25th of March celebrations, before the parade.",St John Cathedral
40,It was very nice church with very beautiful paintings. Our guide explained the importance of the place and few icons. Nice stop.,St John Cathedral
40,"The trouble with reviewing this church is I can only discuss the outside, it was closed, and on a Sunday at that. Pleasant to look at, it would have been nicer to see the interior",St John Cathedral
40,This cathedra is in the archbishop palace courtyard. It is a must especially if you admire culture and beauty,St John Cathedral
50,"Maybe the only temple in Nicosia with all its frescos, very small, worth visiting it between your visits into the Folk and Byzantine Museums.",St John Cathedral
50,it is the only church within the walls that is covered with frescoes of the18th century The iconostasis is woodcarved and gold plated Many of the icons are importand paintings of Cornaro one of the most famous agiografers of the 18th century Modest simple inspires you gives the feeling of christianity,St John Cathedral
30,"As said, this is a church close to Archbishop ""Palace""... There is no reason to go there unless you want to get married...!",St John Cathedral
30,There are much more impressive churches if you are into religion travelling. Nothing much to see and not much nearby so is a nope....,St John Cathedral
40,"From the outside the Cathedral is no bigger than a church but when you learn the reason why its so small all the history falls into place. Be prepared for your breath to be taken away when you step inside, it is stunning! The decoration is so,so beautiful the vaulted ceilings, the walls,the lighting and the gold work. Another bonus for finding the Cathedral is it's lovely and cool inside",St John Cathedral
50,"this is not easy to get into; we walked all round before coming back to the first door which was open. Other tourists were wandering round. Beautiful wall paintings in this tiny cathedral. Loos were shut, but museum has superb facilities",St John Cathedral
50,"If you spent at least 1 day in Nicosia I recommend to visit this St John Cathedral. Small very simple exterior but the interior is really breathtaking. Rich colorful decoration. It's a pity, the photo is prohibited.",St John Cathedral
40,"We actually went to see the Archbishop's Palace but it very rarely opens! We took a stroll into St Johns and what a beautiful cathedral it is, 300 year old paintings still intact.",St John Cathedral
50,"A tour around the Archbishopric area is a must for anyone visiting Nicosia, and the Saint John's Cathedral (Agios Giannis) is within its gates. This tiny 17th C church, still operating today, is painted with icons from top to bottom and has typical Cypriot woodcarvings, of the period.",St John Cathedral
50,"The best Greek Orthodox church in Nicosia, where you can enjoy byzantine orthodox service! Excellent performance from all constituents.",St John Cathedral
50,"In true byzantine tradition, is one of the most ornate and beautiful churches I have visited, you cannot take pictures, by the way...In the centre of town, part of the complex that houses the Icon Museum and other attractions, this is a working church so remember to bring longer shorts and all that...",St John Cathedral
50,This church can be found on 300 meters of the liberty monument. The church itself is nice te be in but the places around the church are also worth a visit (even just to take a photo). 3 nices statues can be found and an authentic Cypriotic place.,St John Cathedral
50,"If you are interested in early Orthodox Christian paintings, this is a remarkable church. It is really fascinating to see the subjects that were chosen to be displayed for the education of people in the Byzantine era who were unable to read, so were informed about their faith through paintings all over the walls and ceilings of the church.",St John Cathedral
30,So this is an older church in the grounds of the Archbishopric and next to the folk museum so it is worth a visit if you are looking round the area but it isn't worth going there specifically.,St John Cathedral
50,The stone built St John's Cathedral is located at the Archbishop Makarios III Foundation compound; it is small with no dome built in the 17th century on the site of a 14th century Benedictine chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist. It was turned into an Orthodox Monastery in 1426 and converted in the 18th century into a Cathedral.The Cathedral is not as impressive from the outside; however it is so great inside where every spot is covered with a perfectly preserved and breathtaking painting or icon. Unfortunately no photos or videos were allowed; but the scene is unforgettable.,St John Cathedral
50,Beautiful frescoes adorn all the walls and vaulted ceiling. A must visit while on a walk through Old Nicosia.,St John Cathedral
40,"Located in old town Nicosia, this church is next to the Archbisop's Palace. Beautiful old church with beautiful icons. Recommended visit for tourists.",St John Cathedral
40,"Being there several times, as a teacher, since we have at least 2 services during national days. Opportunity for this will be for visitors next Wednesday 28.10.2015, around 09:00 hrs. Be there and after the mass you will be able to go inside.",St John Cathedral
40,a beautiful church with Greek influence. the exterior has a number of interesting artworks and the interior is beautiful,St John Cathedral
50,"Don't leave Nicosia without visiting this Cathedral. It's a monument, trademark of the Greek Orthodox religion of the Cypriots, really amazing. Better to visit Sunday after 10.00 right after the service finishes.",St John Cathedral
40,"For a Cathedral, St John's is very small, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in frescos and icons, which cover the walls and the ceiling. It is easy to find as it is situated just beyond the Archbishop's palace. It is free to enter and certainly worth spending some time looking at all of the amazing frescos.",St John Cathedral
40,"It's pretty small and very hot inside, but the paintings are extraordinary. Unfortunately it's not allowed to take photos.",St John Cathedral
50,"This small cathedral stands next to the Archbishop's Palace somewhat tucked away from the busier parts of the Greek side of Nicosia and on first glance it looks to be a really neat and tidy small church. However, it is beautifully proportioned and offers one of the most attractive interiors you are likely to see. There is no photography inside so no pictures unfortunately but if you visit please go inside as the artwork and gold detailing on the walls and ceiling are simply superb. It makes this small cathedral very special indeed and worth the time to seek it out.",St John Cathedral
50,"This little stone Church is close to the Archbishop palace and Cyprus handicrafts museum. Maybe I wouldn't come in, but I saw a group of French tourists going in and so did I.The interior is excellent, with beautiful wood carvings painted in gold, fabulous iconography, chandeliers,..",St John Cathedral
40,Avery small cathedral but worth the visit. It sits right beside the Archbishops Palace in old Nicosia,St John Cathedral
50,Very Unique of its kind left after loosing 600 churches after the Turkish inventionIcons are very we'll look after and restore very well.The acoustic is unique as I followedSeveral ceremonies,St John Cathedral
50,This is a beautifully decorated interior church. It is very small but visit if you can. The ornate gold work and the wonderful paintings are worth it,St John Cathedral
40,"The cathedral in Nicosia is an absolutely wondrous place. Lots of history and a place of quiet and peaceful reflection. The architecture is stunning. I would highly recommend a visit, but wear trousers or long shorts. Some churches provide you with robes to wear if your knees are uncovered, but others will just not allow entry.",St John Cathedral
40,"Although very little, it is one of the most important churches in Cyprus, the official seat of the Archbishop of Cyprus. Built in the second half of the 17th c and painted in the 18th c, artistically its decorations are much less valuable when compared to the Troodos churches, but still have a lot of charm.",St John Cathedral
50,A beautiful ancient church adjoining the Archbishops Palace in the old part of the City of Nicosia. A moment of quite reflection on how aristocratic the area was in times gone by.,St John Cathedral
40,"The cathedral is not so big, but the best part of it is the architecture and the paintings inside, which have a strong and complicated meaning. From these painting you'll learn about the importance of the Church for the Cypriots and about the rivality between the Greeks and the Turks. You definitely need a guide while you visit this place (you can just wait a tourist group that speaks one of your languages you know and stay with it). Photos inside are not allowed.",St John Cathedral
50,"St John's Cathedral is a small stone-built church of 14th century with wallpaintings dated 18th century.Located at the historical center of the old town of Nicosia, the only divited capital in Europe.The church is in the yard of Archbishopic Palace , where is also the Archbishop Makarios Foundation, a Byzantine Museum and Art Gallery of great interest.Groups of tourists usually visit the Cathedral and walk all around interesting historical buildings, the town's Walls and Gates.I like it and i thing is good to be visited.",St John Cathedral
50,"Not as all impressive Cathedrals in Europe, but small and beautiful stone-built in 14th century, with wallpaintings dated 18th century.I loved it ! Located at the historical center of the old town of Nicosia, the only divited capital in Europe.The church is in the yard of Archbishopic Palace , where is worthwhile to visit the gallery as well.",St John Cathedral
50,The visit to Lefkosia was impressive.The island of Cyprus in spring is more than beautiful; I never saw so many yellow flowers.The road from Limassol to Lefkosia is impressive and the guide familiarized us with the sad history of the island and the Greek people:the heartbreaking story of the Greek refugees who lost everything and were forgotten by the international community.The stop at the cathedral followed after we admired the impressive circular Venetian wall built in the 16th century.The small cathedral has the walls covered with old frescoes painted from 1736 to 1756 and inspired by stories from the Bible.Another treasure is the carved iconostasis covered with golden leaves.A place not to miss when you visit Lefkosia.,St John Cathedral
50,The paintings on the walls of this church is magnificent and well-preserved. The paintings all re-enact the accounts from the bible. Interesting one-aisle church which looks simple on the exterior but a typical byzantine interior.,St John Cathedral
50,"It was built by Archibishop Nikiforos in 1662 on the site of a 14th century Benedictine chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist. It was turned into an Orthodox Monastery in 1426 when the Benedictine Order left the island following the Mameluke raids. The Orthodox church dedicated to St John the Theologian, remained a monastery until the 18th century when Archbishop Sylvester converted it into a cathedral, establishing it as the seat of the Orthodox Archbishopric in Cyprus. It is a small-aisled church with Franco-Byzantine arhitectural elements, its high external buttresses giving the impression from the outside of being a fortress. It is the only church in Lefkosia in which the whole of the internal wall paintings have survived in their entirety. The four large icons on the icon screen were painted by the Cretan master, Ioannis Kornaros, in 1795 and 1797, Its 18th century wall paintinga sepict scenes from the Holy Bible and the discovery of the tomb of St Varnavas at Salamina.",St John Cathedral
50,We went to see the Makarios III Gallery to view the Icons (Well worth it if you like Ecclesiastical art); the Cathedral is in the immediate area - you have to walk by it to enter the Gallery! We looked around for about 15 min. It was interesting how small it was. I expected a Cathedral Church to be big and imposing.,St John Cathedral
50,This Cathedral is amazing...with wonderful wall-paintings...with Byzantine eagle...located near Archbishop palace....purely amazing....,St John Cathedral
