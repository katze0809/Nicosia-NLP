40,"This is the former residence of a dragoman (interpreter for the Sultan’s council) in the late 1700’s. Wandering through the classic Ottoman-style rooms you get a feel for what it was like during that period. The house has a number of rooms, a courtyard and the remains of a hamman all open to the public. We liked the freedom to explore the property and its surrounds but a few more information boards explaining what we saw would have been handy.",Ethnological Museum House of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios
40,"I very much enjoyed my visit to the Ethnological Museum House of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios, which can be found at the edge of the old town Lefkosia.Entry is very reasonable, at 2.50€, and the entire property can be seen in detail in about 30 minutes. I found that to be a reward after spending the day in and out of museums and tourist areas. The old men working the entry were great fun, offering me kumquats from their private stash, and inviting me as the only visitor to enjoy all of the property. I'm fascinated by Near Oriental styling and architecture and so this home was precisely what I wanted. One of my favourite parts was being able to sample fruits from the trees in the courtyard. I took a lime, which later was used for my drink, and ate one of the pomegranates.",Ethnological Museum House of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios

The house and garden area are quite charming and you can imagine it was very grand in its day (built over 200 years ago). There is a little bit of history about the family that lived there, mostly written in Greek. The pictures are enough to get the gist though.",Ethnological Museum House of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios
