The frescos, in places, are worn displaying the age of this small church revealing the earlier originals whose couloirs are still as vibrant as the day they were first painted.The road up to Asinou is a tortuous mountain road but it’s worth the journey.

There will be a story there.The church is at an end / start of a forest walk so you can tie that one in with a hike, it's in the Rother walking guide. Not too sure about photo's I assumed they were off limits so didn't ask. I suspect the warden should have had kittens with flash photography looking at some of the pictures posted, all very nice but....",Panagia Asinou Church

50,"The small church at Asinou is a Unesco-protected gem!Every surface of the interior is covered with paintings, some dating back to 1105, all beautifully conserved and utterly fascinating.Some of the paintings are on top of older ones, and in places the conservators have revealed both layers. There are some delightful details to discover if you take your time. I love the scene in the apse with Judas creeping away from the other apostles, watched by Christ (this painting is part of the original decoration from 1105/6); and the little devil at Christ's feet in the Baptism scene in the vault (apparently it is a personification of the River Jordan).Arguably the best example of these unique Byzantine churches, Asinou is well worth the visit.",Panagia Asinou Church

Beautiful scenery and the isolated location of this church adds to the sense of reverence when you enter and see the beautiful paintings.For those trying to visit these 10 listed UNESCO Byzantine churches, the Cyprus Tourist board can provide opening hours. I managed to visit 8 in 2 days. .. 7 were open during the hours published. One I had to phone the number displayed at the church but the custodian arrived 10 minutes later and gave me a wonderful guided tour... this was Metamorfisis tou Sotiros (I will be adding a specific review later). The 2 chuches I did not manage to see both were listed as ones you had to phone to arrange the visit (Stavros tou Agiasmati near Platanista and Panagia tou Podithou near Galata) and I simply did not have the time to wait as was driving solo and that proved time consuming to say the least!",Panagia Asinou Church
50,"The frescoes in this church are absolutely gorgeous and a valuable piece of art history, as is the architecture of the building itself.Other reviewers have complained about a lot of the UNESCO protected churches being closed in Cyprus - you do often have to go and find a key holder (usually located in the local village coffee shop!) to get in, guidebooks will usually tell you where. This one is open to the public from around 10-4 weekdays I believe. It is definitely worth a visit and often a port of call for coach excursions around the island.",Panagia Asinou Church
50,Really is worth the drive to this small church. Dates back to the AD 1100s with frescoes that remain from that time. There are other UNESCO churches in the area but they didn't open although were advertised as such (we even tried twice to see them).,Panagia Asinou Church

50,"One of the oldest and most scenic churches in Cyprus. This is where me and my wife chose to get married because of the ""warm"" feeling and the incredible scenery surroundings. It feels like hundreds of years of history when standing in the church and that is a very special feeling indeed.

50,"This Byzantine church is a UNESCO world heritage site. Its architecture is interesting (with a tile roof built by the crusaders), the inside is fascinating (most of the paintings having been restored) and whole place emanates peace, serenity and makes one dwell a little in the past. Beware, it is not open 24/7: locals told you may need to contact the priest in the neighboring village to open the doors for you.",Panagia Asinou Church
50,They have nearly finished restoring the paintings (frescos) on the walls and ceilings and have done a lovely job. Well worth the short trip.,Panagia Asinou Church
50,"From the outside it looks like an old barn, but inside you walk into a (literal) treasure trove, as the whole of the interior is covered with ancient frescoes (some a millenium old). The effect is spellbinding, and it is worth travelling many miles to see (I hired a taxi for the day, as am not a driver, and just had to see some of the painted churches of the Troodhos). If you are a Christian (or struggling with your faith, like me) the church has an extra, blessed dimension, and you won't forget it.",Panagia Asinou Church

50,"This world heritage site has to be seen to be believed and wondered. Yes, it's a slog to get there and yes, it's small BUT the paintings inside are breathtakingly beautiful and show one man's love for his sick daughter. It was to me, a Christian, very moving. Whilst I realise it will not mean as much to people of other faiths, the paintings alone are to be marvelled and admired.",Panagia Asinou Church
50,"We took the children for a day trip from Nicosia. The church was not so difficult to find. It s small but lovely. With wall paintings dating back many centuries. The fact that it is a UNESCO world heritage site, speaks for itself. The surrounding area is very green and quiet. After visiting the church we took a short walk and then had lunch at the restaurant just opposite the church. Tasted some traditional Cypriot dishes and then headed back to Nicosia. If you want to spend a relaxing day visiting a cultural/ religious monument in the countryside, and if you want to have a trip in a quiet green area and maybe a walk in the woods, worth visiting. If you want more activity, to see lots of people and don t like driving, or road trips, you will not enjoy this trip.",Panagia Asinou Church
50,"If you do not have the opportunity to visit the churches in the mountain of Troodos, Panagia Asinou Church is a very characteristic example, it is close to Nicosia and you will surely enjoy the visit.",Panagia Asinou Church

50,"We visited that unique and beautiful church in April 2010, when we made a tour in Cyprus for few days. In the way to Kakopetria travelling through Trodos Mountains we stoped and enjoyed the view of the Church of Our Lady of Asinou, that being the only part which remained from the Monastery of Phorvia and is near the village of Nikitari. This church is one of the most important Byzantine churches in Cyprus. The wall-paintings are very good preserved on the west and east walls and are great. Everything in that church make you feel like the ancient history flow through your soul and body. It is a great and unforgettable experience to see it. Do not hesitate if you come in Cyprus, to come here and visit that exceptional monument.",Panagia Asinou Church
50,"It is a very nice church, in the middle of nowhere (try to avoid the restaurants near there) continue traveling to other areas for food further either to Troodos, kakopetria etc. Make sure before you drive of the timetable of the church (when it is open).",Panagia Asinou Church
40,"A pretty little church with impressive frescoes. But this is just one of the mediaval churches one can visit on the mountains of the Troodos. Other beautiful even if simple churches include Panayia tou Araka, St John Lampadistis (in the pretty village of Kalopanayiotis). It would be greart pity if visitors only stay on the coast and miss on these beauties.",Panagia Asinou Church
40,"Since that church is in the UNESCO HERITAGE Cataloque you have to visit it firstly for the whole envirometn =, it is in the forest with pine trees all over.... you can take a rest at the nearby restaurant or continue your way to troodos mountain or kikkos monastry... is on the way....",Panagia Asinou Church

50,I had the chance for a month to visit daily the church for a university program.The feeling you get in the church when you know the history having listened to the holy anthems so many times is amazing. Also the unspoilt view from there gives you a feeling of tranquility and self discovery. I often found my self wondering about stuff while over there and finding peace in church surroundings. The only down sign is that it is a long way from Larnaca.,Panagia Asinou Church
50,"Like all Cyprus churches, another place of Christianity who is absolutely obligatory to be seen",Panagia Asinou Church
50,"This is a church built in the early 12th century and is a UNESCO world heritage site. It is a small church and the elaborate byzantine frescoes on the walls depict heaven and hell, the annunciation, as well as other religious themes. It is better to go without a tour group, with a limited number of friends, so you have the time to appreciate the details of the church, paintings and nature around it. It is a place for contemplation and positive energy. There are restaurants nearby within a few minutes' walk and a visit there would make a pleasant day away from the noise of the city.",Panagia Asinou Church
20,"it was an excursion - 17 buses full! we lined up to go inside - it's a very small church and only 2 real icons - all the rest is painted on the walls. u light a candle which u bring with u and then blow it out. apparently a lot of christenings take place there and there are 3 restaurants close by. plenty of parking in open fields. tricky entrance and exits as it's old and you must watch your footing and wonky steps. must have a history but wrote nothing anywhere about it. a very holy place and we went before saint mary's day 21.11 - thus making it more special. quaint, interesting.",Panagia Asinou Church
