50,Very nice and cozy market. Safe and clean. Lots of dining options. Various walking directions. Recommended.,Nicosia Open Market
30,"Did not enjoy this trip. We spent total of 5hr on a coach with only 3 hrs to look round. The market was interesting all the little streets, but most selling same things. Glad I went but dont think I would visit again. And on the main street lots of shops we have at home. Bit disappointed.",Nicosia Open Market

40,"This old market has lots of local items. It is crowded both on the Greek and Turkish sides but the atmosphere is solid, you'll love it.",Nicosia Open Market
50,"Not all the fruit and veg is cheaper than supermarkets, also stall holders are not too keen you buy small quantities but they are quite willing to have a chat and try to sell their produce. Very colourful with the displays.",Nicosia Open Market
30,"I went to Nicosia for only one day, so I had not enough time to go all around the place. I spent half my time in the Greek side and the other half in the Turkish side, mostly where the market was. The latter was full of stalls and small shops selling named brands clothes, and all kinds of home produce. Prices are cheap. Not attractive places to eat, On the Greek side there are also many shops and stalls with Greek products, mostly vegetables. An interesting experience..",Nicosia Open Market
40,"If you are staying in Nicosia for a few days you must visit the Open Market where vendors sell local produce and goods. Some are people coming from villages who sell olives, fetta, and kolokassi. While there is not a lot of variety between stands, you can taste local traditions and enjoy the bustling market. Prices are cheaper than in a grocery store but quality varies.",Nicosia Open Market
30,"We visited Nicosia for the day whilst staying on the Greek side of Cyprus, as you walk through the Greek side approaching the border point you will notice all the modern shops and cafes, however, once you are through to the Turkish side you notice a marked difference, no new shops here, no fancy cafes, lots of stalls selling hand made goods, lots of places selling 'named brands' not so professionally done. Lots of lovely little places to eat. Very cheap to buy things at the moment with the lira so low, I suggest changing a little stirling to buy souveners, it goes a long way",Nicosia Open Market
40,"Great produce, dried fruits, nuts, pasta, vegetables, bakery items, and don‚Äôt miss the jams and farm-made wines.",Nicosia Open Market
50,"Old town is a nice mixture of tourist trap and an interesting place! We strolled around for a couple of hours and found quite a lot of nice shops, when we left the main streets. Highly recommendable!",Nicosia Open Market
40,"Many years since I was in Nicosia , the open markets , the smiling faces .We stayed with friends and we went all over this city within a city, the history of just this city is fascinating of how Turkey invaded Cyprus. Even today when you look through the gun holes you can see the burnt out rounds and the Turkish soldiers watching everyone very carefully lol.",Nicosia Open Market
30,"Open market is always best place to buy cheaper products, you have to roam about to find good prices",Nicosia Open Market
50,I love local markets no matter what they are selling: food or goods. You meet interesting people and see local culture up close. This one is excellent with all kinds of traditional goods and a smaller food section. Just wandering around offers an adventure. Buying goods adds another layers.,Nicosia Open Market
20,"It‚Äôs a very simple fruit & veg market. On the day we went, with a basket of live snails a few of which were making their escape ‚Äì unfortunately at a snail‚Äôs pace so they probably didn‚Äôt get far. There is parking at the market but its limited however most people are done within 30 minutes tops so the traffic flows in & out of the carpark nicely. The presentation of the produce is rather haphazard. Maybe you will get some cheap fruit & veg but really there is nothing unusual.",Nicosia Open Market
40,"I cant imagine why a tourist would go there.... but if you leave in Cyprus etc. and wish to get fresh vegetables, fruits etc. This is the best place and value for money especially if you go around 12 lunch time since they want to sell everything and not take back their goodies... Therefore this is the best time to go...",Nicosia Open Market
40,Enjoy both sides of the city -if you can- not only this interesting marketing but also mosks and the orthodox churches.,Nicosia Open Market
40,It is a huge very clean and organized Fruits and Vegetables Market; situated at the Venetian walls adjacent to Bayraktar Mosque opened only on Wednesdays for farmers to present their fresh produce of the season; locals frequent this market because of the great choice of quality products at very low prices.,Nicosia Open Market
40,Lovely place. Must go place with faimly. Enjoyed walking and sat for a beer in local tavetn with delicious haloumi.,Nicosia Open Market
50,Lots of bargains to be hold in the bustling open air merchant sellers and shops that are packed along the streets of the Northern occupied part of Nicosia.Lots of places to eat and drink and lots to buy.Well worth a visit.,Nicosia Open Market
50,"Nicosia is full of allies with loads of shops,cafes,bars,money exchange,anyone going to Cyprus must visit Nicosia old town,one down side its not open at night we went through the day and found it extremely hot so went back at night when it was a little cooler to find it wasn't open,only some of the bars.",Nicosia Open Market
50,We drove from limisol to nicosia took about 55 min easy drive parked in underground car park at the macdonalds right next to the boarder crossing area which is at end of walkway no problems either going into Turkish area or returning to Greek side. Vast difference in buildings in turkish side. Bought some really unique business shirts very smart 100 percent cotton slim fit cutAt small tailor shop lots of clothing bargins in marketYou must try the Turkish delight from one of the market shops with more than 50 odd flavours to choose from 1 kilo box cost 7 Euro you select the flavour and amounts of each.Don't forget your passport.,Nicosia Open Market
50,If coming from Cyprus you will need your passport to cross the borderI felt like I was going into another country it was great loads of market stalls and original buildings great little bars and places to see,Nicosia Open Market
30,We walk all the way shops and discovered Debenhams which the tallest building. Go on the top floor where you can find the restaurant and the view to the enture city. There is free wifi and a smokers lounge for smokers. Good place to relax and just enjoy the view.,Nicosia Open Market
40,"If you will be living for some time in Nicosia, you better check this out! It is held every Wednesday and Saturday (approximate hours :sun-rise to sun-dawn). You will find many producers from various parts of Cyprus, bring their products to be sold. Not only fruits and vegetables, but also other home-mafe products like pickles, bread, trahana (pulgur wheat and milk mixed and then sun-dried, to end up as the first ingredient for soup), and many more.Walk around the whole market first, then go back and choose.Not many speak English, but everbody is friendly and willing to assist.Parking is very difficult on that day, because the market is actually held AT one the municipal parking placesPrices are very reasonable and if you go towards the end of the day, you get special offers (VERY special offers).",Nicosia Open Market
40,Nicosia itself was very disappointing. Evidence of the struggle since the 70's is very prevalent and interesting but it is also sad. The Greek side was a bit lack lustre so it was a surprise when we crossed to the Turkish side to find a bustling market and lovely locals. It abounds with fake designer goods which you are not permitted to bring back across the border to the Greek side but there are some fabulous jewellers with very good prices. Cross over the border is as simple as showing your passport and having a separate piece of paper stamped which only takes a couple of minutes and is no hassle at all.,Nicosia Open Market
50,Take plenty of water with you plenty of nice eateries and shopping but be warned it's like a oven and there isn't much air to cool you down,Nicosia Open Market
40,"This is a place I always bring my friends who are visiting Cyprus and they are all thrilled. Especially for those who come from Northern Europe and are not used to a variety of fruit and vegetables. You can do some food shopping and have a taste of ""authentic"" Cyprus. Most vendors are producers themselves who come to Nicosia from their villages especially for this market. Apart from fruit and vegetables, you can find home made bread and pastries, traditional sweets, nuts, ham, sausages... It's a place I absolutely love! Every Wednesday and Saturday from early morning till afternoon.",Nicosia Open Market
