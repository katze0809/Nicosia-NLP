50,We had this place on the list to visit because we where a small group of 4 motorists enthusiasts. It is a must see place. Andreas was great. We where the only ones there and he really took the time to walk with us and explain everything. We found out that he’s been to Romania a few times and it was overall a really nice experience. I highly recommend this place.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum

50,I really enjoyed this small but packed museum in the walled city close to Paphos Gate. Some real gems and some that need lots of work. Note the bikes are not refurbished. Just some of them. I love Royal Enfields and they had two very old specimens from the 50s.....took some pics and felt it was worth the 5 euro entry fee. Some very cool bikes here. Close to Leda Street. Enjoy.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"If you appreciate motorbikes this is a hidden gem. Andreas showed us around his collection of (mostly) British classic motorbikes and explained where they came from and their significance. His passion for his bikes was obvious. He then offered us a Cypriot coffee and we just chatted for about another 45minutes. At only €5 per head, if you have any interest in motorbikes this is a 'must visit' place.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,"This jewel is nestled in the old in the old town in Nacosa, just steps away from Cyprus/Turkey border in the northern part of Cyprus. Place is well run by a motoring enthusiast, Andreas, who has wealth of knowledge in motorcycles and car as a collector.

50,For those passionate about motorcycles drop by at the museum. Andreas is not selling any of his valuable assets and still expanding the collection,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,"A privately owned museum of mostly British bikes, some interesting, historical and unusual examples. Very friendly staff. My only criticism is that the information provided for some of the exhibits really should be available for all of them. If you have any interest in motorcycles don’t miss this on your trip to Nicosia, there is a small car park nearby which (I think) costs €3 all day.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"One of the best motorcycles museum in the world, you can find out a lot of historic motorcycles from over 1 century ago till now (1914)",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,A visibly engaged and knowledgeable guide showed me around. On display were gems like a carefully restored New Hudson 1914. Only three left in the world said my guide. There are also a couple of HDs which were once given by President Kennedy to Archbishop Makharios. He left it to his guards to drive them. The collection is large and in various stages of restauration.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,Contact Andreas before visiting to avoid disappointment. A fantastic collection of classic bikes from 1914 to the 90s. Well worth a visit for classic bike fans. And a free coffee too!,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"Andreas Nicolaou runs the Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum and it's well worth the wait for it to open and for you to enter and be enthralled by that held within.Andreas conducted a tour of his museum and then after that we sat down and told stories about motorbikes. He has over one hundred bikes in his collection there, and quite a few scattered across other areas of Nicosia. He has done all the work on all of them himself. It is clearly a labour of love and this shines through when he talks about the various bikes in the museum.For a person who loves bikes, this place cannot be missed. When in Nicosia, make a beeline for it. The opening times need to be paid careful attention to as it is not open all the time. Andreas has many other bikes to look after as well. If you are a rider, do not miss this place.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"This was my second visit and I loved it. I messaged the museum on Facebook and got an almost instant reply as to when they were open.I restore and ride old bikes. So this was a must do for any visit to Nicosia. Great selection of old bikes, some I have or had the same as. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable. I felt the entry cost of €5 was very reasonable for a privately owned collection on display. Plenty of interesting bikes, mainly English from 1950's to 1960's",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"Went there this morning around 10:30 and saw someone waiting outside the museum which was still closed. Someone came in after about 5 minutes and opened the museum. Paid the Euro5 entry fee and went inside.One is taken back on the last 100 years to see bikes from different countries and the oldest one was around 1914.Some bikes need restoring and there was one with a jar in front of it where one could donate some money for its restoration.The selection was good and saw bikes from Second World War, ones used by the local police and there were heaps of them. You could take photographs.The museum is opened throughout the year but since they are restoring the front of the museum which was damaged by fire they may be busy with other things.It is better to call and check before going there. It's worth a visit and supposed to be the biggest bike museum in Europe.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
30,"I heard some good reports from people who had visited this museum In the past.We made the trip out from Larnaca to Nicosia, about an hour by bus .Unfortunately the premises were not open at time stated on board, so I guess it makes sense to always double check and call before making a special visit. Being a small, one man operation he probably has to close occasionally to attend to other personal duties. Maybe one day I will make a return visit. PJ Barker author of the novel Changing Pillion.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
20,Museum idea is very good but I before seeing it I imagined it will be bigger and arranged by by dates of models...it is expensive comparing to the area of the museum.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
10,I have been to this place a few times now and I am convinced it is closed and will never be open. Let's get rid of this tantalising advertisement to ensure others are not disappointed wasting time trying to view it.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
10,"I'd love to be able to write a glowing review about the museum, however, in the 15 years that I have been coming to Cyprus on holiday, this place has never ever ever ever been open!.....what's the bloody point??",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
10,"We tried to visit the museum on a Tuesday at around 1:30pm, according the this page it was supposed to be open till 5pm, however it was closed! It was very disappointing as I was really excited to visit the museum! No information was present on the outside of the museum.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"Went here with my husband and although I am not really an avid motorbike fan, I could not help but be impressed with this guys private collection. Totally amazing and such dedication and commitment to restoring the motorbikes, definitely a labour of love. A really friendly and knowledgeable chap with lots of pieces of interesting information about the bikes. Well worth visiting. Opens at 10.00 - 13.00 and 15.00 - 18.00 or thereabouts.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"Having waited nearly a year to visit this museum, it is fair to say it was well worth waiting for. Andrea's (the owner) has built this exhibition on 100% entheausisim and passion. He spent nearly an hour with us and gave us a bolt by bolt history on nearly every bike that he himself had rebuilt. He also has guite a few bikes as ""work in progress"" This museum is obviously his life's work, and his collection is just fantastic and so interesting. If you are interested in bikes please take the time to visit this museum, you will not be disappointed. You will also find Andreas a fantastic host as well.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,You must visit it !! its a very nice place for motorcyclist lovers you can find a lot of special motorcycles in the museum very rare bikes !! Keep the hard work !!,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,Just off the main street.This great little motor bike museum is a delight.If you are into bikes then this place is for you.The four euro enterance fee is worth it.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,"Yes you have to be a BIKER to appreciate this museum.I met the owner ANDREAS,in Paphos a few years ago,he needed a lift to Nicosia,i gave him a lift ,2 hour drive,he in return gave us the rest of his day showing us the real Nicosia.The museum is within walking distance of the border control on LEDRA street,so both sides of the border can freely visit the museum,clearly sign posted at end of Ledra street.Themuseum is an old building converted very sympatheticlyOn entering we were amazed by the private collection here,mainly English bikes in various stages of condition,some as found ,others bought back to life,all found in Cyprus.Its amazing what is hidden away in Cyprus as i have found loads historic vehicals over the years here.A slow hours visit,taking in the printed history of this museum and viewings is worth coming when in Nicosia.This is a private collection and funded by its owner,small entrance fee,which helps support up keep.Look around back streets here and discover real Nicosia and its communities..T",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,The vintage motorcycles are spectacular. Photos were taken for friends back home. Andreas' passion for the vintage motorcycles left no question unanswered. This is a must see for any gear-head or motorcycle enthusiast.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
20,"The place is just a hall full of motocycles. Maybe I am just not such a big fan of the motocycles... Or I expected something better. The machines were just left there even without labeling giving some information about them. As a friend of mine said, ""it is a collection, not a museum"".",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
10,"Check the website, it is supposed to be open from 3pm. Wasn't. There was no information posted outside. Waited around for 20 minutes then left. The doors, however, were a nice green colour.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
20,"We came to visit at a bit past 1600 on a Wednesday. Their webpage states they should be open at the time, but the door was closed. We called their phone number, but there was no answer. The following day some of our group managed to visit during the day (we split up), and they told them they'd be open until late that day. Those of us who missed it went and found it closed again.If you wish to go, call them beforehand to make sure they are open. Overall, it was disappointing.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,"This is a private museum where the owner has collected different motorcycles over the years with ones going back 100 years.Staff is very knowledgable and can explain them all to you.Very good place for anyone to visit, not just a motorcycle enthusiast.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,"Anyone who likes classic motorcycles and scooters will like it here. The total collection consists of over 300 motorcycles, but due to space limitations only about 100 are on display. These are in various stages of repair, or maybe disrepair would be a more appropriate description for some of them.The collection has been assembled by one man; Andreas Nicolaou. He collected the machines as and when they were found, but such is the way of life, there are more than just one person can restore is a short time span. They are being restored when possible and when funds become available. What is on display consists of some restored bikes and some in as found condition.Personally, I think he has done well to rescue the bikes. If he had not done so they would in all probability have gone to scrap.We will certainly go there again when we next visit Nicosia.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"A must for any local and traveller alike. This is a small and well presented museum a few meters away from the Green Line. The owner Mr Andreas is a motorbike fanatic and his collection is an indication of this. From the last Newton ever made in 1969, to the motorcade bikes used by the first president of the Republic of Cyprus Archbishop Makarios and the twin bikes gifted to Makarios by John F Kennedy following his visit to the USA. It speaks the history of the island and the passion the owner has had since he was a young teenager",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
40,"This museum has lots of old motorcycles, lovingly restored by the owner, it is not expensive to get in (forgot how much). You can have a water, orange juice or tea or coffee while inside. Nice lady on the desk",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,Cyprus history in motorcycles. Very interesting museum. Do you have bicycle or bike? you SHOULD go there!!,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
50,"If you love motorcycles, don't miss this museum! It's loaded with motorcycles but apparently contains only a fraction of the motorcycles that museum owner Andreas has. We had a great visit to this museum and spent time talking with Andreas who invited us for coffee and talked with us about his collection.",Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
30,Kind of hard to find until you buy a map and ask some of the older shop keepers for directions. The collection of Motorcycles is primarily British Motorcycles with a few Italian and a couple of American Harley-Davidson Panhead model Police motorcycles from the early '60s mixed in. If you love motorcycles and want a break from the sun stop by and enjoy the wonderful selection of motorcycles.,Cyprus Classic Motorcycle Museum
