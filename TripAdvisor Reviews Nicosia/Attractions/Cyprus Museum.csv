40,A good collection of ancient artifacts. Visitors would benefit from a greater amount of information about the collection.,Cyprus Museum
40,"Great little museum in central Nicosia. The entry fee is 4.5 Euro for an adult. The museum has a fine collection of antiques going back close to 3000 years ago. Highligts include a large bronze statue, beautifully decorated vases and jugs and many marble statues of different sizes. I enjoyed looking at the wide rage of ways to decorated the clay Potter, from simple patterns to precise figures and animals full of emotions. A good way to spend an hour if the weather is too rainy- or hot. It has a small souvenir shop too with a good selection and fair prices.",Cyprus Museum
50,"It was pleasure to explore this hidden gem of couture in Nicosia. It was tide, clean, the staff was kind and helpful for me to explore and learn about the history of Cyprus. There is a lot of old things here",Cyprus Museum
50,"There is so much in this museum and it is so well presented, including narratives on the exhibits. Fortunately, the museum is not swamped with visitors so you have plenty of time to absorb what you are seeing and to spend time by your favourite items - I particularly liked their own version of the terracotta army (a lot more variety in their characters).",Cyprus Museum

50,Small but loaded with pure Cyprus artifacts .Lacks information but it was so worth the visitMy main interest here are the old sites so I was very happyWith this museum,Cyprus Museum
40,"There are plenty of museums in nicosia, but if you have to choose one, make it the cyprus museum.It is packed with interesting objects and artefacts taken from the various sites in Cyprus. If you already visited one or more of these archeological sites, this is a plus.We didn't read all tne information boards as we already read a lot in our guides, but focused on the pieces that really interested us.Overall a pleasant visit and worth taking a little detour outside the old city walls.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Not very big, and no new insights in prehistoric and historic developments. What makes it worth visiting is the quality of several exhibits.",Cyprus Museum
50,Small museum with extraordinary collection. I am a frequent Archeology and ancient history museum goer but I have never seen anything like some of the oldest and unique pieces I saw here. Collection is labeled ( including in English) but I am sorry that I had not visited at the times when there was a Tour.In addition there is bronze bigger than life sized statue of the first African born Roman Emperor that is worth admission by itself,Cyprus Museum
50,This place is historical place and anywhere didn't change.Bloods and hole(with gun) in the wall it is horrible but it is history and reality,Cyprus Museum
40,Small but well arranged and full of surprises. Spend sometime to study 5he exhibits. Well worth the visit.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Plenty to see here if you are into archaeology , The museum , in the Greek half of Nicosia , is house in a neo -classical building and it is mainly thanks to the British that these artifacts were saved for posterity . Sometimes there are cases full of similar objects but some are outstanding ; amongst the artifacts that span the neolithic age to 250 AD the most noteworthy are the collection of votive figurines , a bronze age pyxis and the statue of Roman Emperor Septimus Severus .......and lots more .",Cyprus Museum
50,"The Cyprus Museum exhibits many antiquities related to the history of the island. These are statues, gold jewelry, weapons, helmets, household utensils. And of course there are many images of the symbol of the Cypriot republic the Pomos idol, which is depicted on the Cypriot coins of 1 and 2 euros. Many items are exceptionally elegant and beautiful. The museum is located in a beautiful mansion in the center of Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
50,"The most amazing collection of very early pots, plus a superb display of human figures, some life size, found at one site.",Cyprus Museum
50,Amazing artefacts - some of them goint back to the neolithic age and earlier. All of them in very good shape and there are many many of them. Not all of them with English (or Greek) labels. If you are not familiar with the history of Cyprus you should get a small broshure on it.,Cyprus Museum
40,A nice collection shown and preserved in a tragic way... Bad air heat and humidity conditions and old fashioned without any safe displays...,Cyprus Museum
40,"€4.50 entry. There are lots of historical artefacts to see. It is worth a visit. Staff are helpful, you can also take photos",Cyprus Museum
50,"A really nice museum full of middle easten history. The exhibition is in chronological order and thats really important, I definitely recommend it . Cant wait to visit the new museum of Cyprus in 3 years",Cyprus Museum
50,Quite interesting. Well preserved objects displayed in chronological order. Close to a must-see if you're in Nicosia and interested in history.,Cyprus Museum
50,"A short walk outside the ancient city walls takes you a great museum highlighting the classical history of Cyprus. Artifacts representing the Phoenician, Persian, Greek and Roman civilizatgions on Cyprus are contained within the museum. Highlights of the museum include a large collection of statues uncovered by a Swedish archaeology team (displayed in the manner in which they were found), funerary objects including large sphinxes, and a huge bronze statue of a man (uncovered by a farmer plowing his fields). The Swedish collection may be Cyprus's answer to China's Terracotta Warriors and this exhibit is reason enough to visit this museum.",Cyprus Museum
50,"I was amazed at all the displays, The ceramics are excellent and beautifully displayed so much history it was well worth the visit.",Cyprus Museum
50,The displays are well arranged and progress from earliest times 7000-10000BC to the Roman period. The ceramics and terracotta displays are excellent. We learnt a lot about early Cypriot history.A must see place to visit.,Cyprus Museum
50,I was amazed at the sheer number of artifacts of Cyprus and their beauty. The Picasso ceramics were undeniably breathtaking! In the Museum shop I found some English language books.,Cyprus Museum
50,the museum building is a site itself..... the exhibits are so many and so well displayed... very pleasant and educational visit...will definitely keep going back,Cyprus Museum
30,Not very big but with great collections from all over Cyprus through the years. Visit it and wont miss... you need about 2 hrs into the museum,Cyprus Museum
50,"The museum is compact but tells and offers great stories about the history. What treasures Cyprus has to offer! Especially the rooms with Neolithic figurines is remarkable. During our visit there was a small but perfect exhibition with ceramics by Picasso inspired by Cypriot pottery. Well done, and it proves this is not a dull place where nothing ever changes. All of the objects are first rate and can be enjoyed even if you are not a trained art historian.",Cyprus Museum
40,Fine collection of ancient Greek artefacts in this classical museum! Worth a visit when you are in Nicosia.,Cyprus Museum
40,"Great museum to understand the history of the Island, it has loads of interesting artifacts from all the eras of Cyprus.",Cyprus Museum
40,"The Cyprus Museum is worth a visit if your interested in Antiquities. Allow an hour to 90 minutes for a visit depending on your level of interest. Most items are well labelled but it can be difficult to pick out the really interesting items as the displays are a little pedestrian.The interior of the building is modern and air conditioned and there is plenty of seating. The building has reasonable disabled access to most areas (ask staff if you need assistance).Photography is permitted without flash but on the whole the building is well lit do shouldn't be a problem for modern digital cameras. Some staff are a little overzealous with the 'no flash' rule so if your camera has and autofocus light, be prepared to be told off (I was!).Worth visiting and very interesting.",Cyprus Museum
40,Excellent exhibition with Cypriot antiquities from which Picasso was inspired to create some of his amazing ceramics,Cyprus Museum
30,"There are a lot of historic treasures, and a lot of work it is being done to showcase them. However, the place feels it could use some makeover. Nevertheless, if you are in Nicosia area, this is a must see!",Cyprus Museum
40,The Cyprus Museum has great and well preserve history. You walk through the facility wondering what next to see: from graves with skeletons to bronze works and statues. Beautiful !!!,Cyprus Museum
50,Just stunning. One of the best museums in Cyprus. What a bonus as there was an exhibition of Picasso’s pottery work.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Great collection of ceramics. Also, the visiting show of Picasso’s Ceramics along side ancient pieces that inspired him was stunningly presented. If all visiting collections are as nice then you must go to this this museum if you’re in Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
40,"I had no idea there were so many ancient finds in Cyprus. Coins and artifacts from as far back as 1200-1300 BC. Beautifully displayed tools, weapons, coins, jewelry, crowns and statues are all on display. Nicosia is the last divided capital in the world. Make sure you read up on the history and visit the buffer zone. We were lucky to have a guide who lived through the invasion by the Turks as a child, adding a very compelling and human element to the history.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Small, but amasing collection of artificial blades, axes , early age's carvings , different stone items , potteries , later on, sculptures , statues , well prepared and displayed in the rooms of a classic style building. Entrance fee was 4.5 Euros , needs 2.5 hours ( for me) . One can find a free ( 31.May. '19) parking nearby , on the left side of ( one-way) Nechrou street. (appr.: 150-200 mts) By my op.: It is a must to see.",Cyprus Museum
40,"We wanted more and we needed more. Everything is very beautiful and well presented but I need to see more things from the Department of Antiquities. I want more from Cyprus for Cyprus. Bigger, better, more immersive. 13000 years of civilisation, 9000 years of arts (Kalavasos/Tenta drawing (7000 BC)) and millenia of habitation. All these must be showcased somewhere, and it doesn't have to be in Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
40,There is a small entrance fee of €4.50 per person. The museum contains many very interesting and beautiful finds excavated in Cyprus. I wish I could find treasure like this!Some of the areas with statues were very dark I think they were having problems with the lighting but interesting nevertheless.Very small shop of site but not selling very much so that was disappointing.,Cyprus Museum
50,This is quite a small museum but inexpensive and also offers discounts for students. You could do the whole place in 1-2 hours. Worth including in your itinerary though.,Cyprus Museum
50,"A nice museum. I like this old place, but I hear that they may eventually move into a larger space that will let them show more of their collections.",Cyprus Museum
50,Interesting insight into the ancient and modern history of Cyprus.Take your time to read the details.Well worth a visit.,Cyprus Museum
30,"Unique historical objects, very interesting exhibitions are spoiled by poor client service. In weekdays in the morning, total customers 3, museum staff clean the exhibition place when visitors are there, they speak so loudly about their private matters, very disturbing, eating in front of visitors etc. Not very good experience, but the place itself deserves better staff",Cyprus Museum
20,"...but very few explanatory signs (not even in Greek), so impossible to get ""the story"" - a pity indeed.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This is the oldest and largest archeological museum in Cyprus. It houses a unique collection of antiquities: various artifacts found over centuries of archaeological research. You may get lost in it. Just joking, I was mesmerised by the terracotta figurines found by sweedish archeologists before the WW II,",Cyprus Museum
30,"... While many objects are well described, providing interesting information, many other objects even don't have a single sign.... Unfortunately, they could do it without mingling politics into the historical facts (referring to the Cyprus issue)",Cyprus Museum
50,With a cultural legacy plundered by many waves of unwanted invaders. This museum holds many of the great treasures of Cyprus not stolen by other nation collectors. Very educational with some unique displays,Cyprus Museum
50,"It's a breathtaking collection of 10.000 years. It's a shame, that we were almost alone in this fantastic museum in the capital of Cyprus.",Cyprus Museum
50,"An excellent museum with very important exhibits. It's a relatively small museum, but graceful and important. easily and quickly you can see all the exhibits without getting tired. Take a little of your time to visit it, it's worth it. Is located in the center of the city.",Cyprus Museum
50,Worth at least an hour or two. Stunning finds and the first and last rooms are extremely well presented.,Cyprus Museum
50,"I went to Cyprus museum with my family. The museum is well structured with a lot of interesting sculptures, monuments and ancient items. Fot the kids a kind of riddle game is given, in order to participate actively and look for the most important items exhibited. A must see sightseeing in Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
30,"If you enjoy looking at artifacts behind glass with little or no interpretation, then this is the museum for you. From the little interpretation that there was, it was possible to gain a great insight in to the culture and history of Cyprus. The most surprising exhibit was one of the terracotta statues which were magnificent. A hidden little know gem of Cypriot history. The museum is worth a visit to give you some background to Cypriot history but the poor interpretation and lack of interaction makes it a less enjoyable visit than it could have been.",Cyprus Museum
40,We visited the museum with a tour guide and we were introduced to the great Cypriot culture influenced by Greece and Turkey.,Cyprus Museum
50,We went to the museum which I really enjoyed. They have. A pamphlet with the main pieces marked and I made sure to see all of those. I thought it was very well done and had clear explanations. Any pieces having to do with Aphrodite are marked with a small gold square. The first day we spent about three hours and having gotten a case of museum overload we went back a couple of days later to finish. It was pretty interesting because last summer we were here and went to most of the sites mentioned. That helped us know what we were looking at. There are people at the museum that can answer questions.,Cyprus Museum
50,For tourists is a good chance to see the ancient culture of Cyprus and to have a general view of amazing pieces that were found in Cyprus excavations. History of a place is always interesting to most of us.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Unfortunately, all the great pieces found before 1974 have ended up the Ethnographic Museum in Stockholm, Sweden.This place is still worth a look round. There were some items I hadn't seen in other museums in the region.Very expensive gift shop, but I still bought a cloth bag to add to my collection.",Cyprus Museum
30,I found this museum a bit of a mixed bag. Some signage is well written and clear others were quite unclear. The flow is odd on the first floor when you enter. I enjoyed the upper floors a lot more. The collections are nice but would benefit from some additional context. The security people were helpful with some good info! Cyprus has such rich history it would be great to see some investment in audio equipment to give depth and context to what is being seen. I realize its a small museum however with limited resources. Certainly worth an hour or two.,Cyprus Museum
50,From ancient times to more recent history - this museum is really well put together. I loved the stone tools and grave sites.,Cyprus Museum
50,"It is not a big museum, but the building has an interesting collection of pottery, greek and helenistic pieces, jewels and some well distributed and presented aspects of ancient life of the island. The roman funeral stones and burial sites are also a must.",Cyprus Museum
40,"We visited at the end of November and when we’d left Paphos it was lovely and warm with bright blue sky’s. But by the time we got to Nicosia it was raining quite heavily and it had turned quite cold.We’d really gone to Nicosia to visit the area adjacent to the green line but couldn’t do that because of the rain.Cold and wet and totally ill dressed we saw the Cyprus Museum and thought we’d visit. We had hoped it would give an overview of the history of Cyprus up to present day. But it’s more about archeological finds.Everything is exhibited in date order and there are some really lovely pieces. There are only 3 rooms not accessible by wheel chair due to steps. It is clear that there is a rich history on the island and some very talented people have lived there over the centuries. Some of the pieces are so detailed that they could have been made in the modern day. The expressions on people’s faces in the sculptures or the bronze, and the translucency of the glass was just lovely.Unfortunately the history however does not go up to present day which was a little disappointing. But all the same I’d recommend the museum to anyone who is interested in history.",Cyprus Museum
20,"If you are looking for a Greek or Italian kind of museum you will be disappointed. The museum is small, with very few items and the building requires maintenance works.Some items exposed are nice and the there is plot in the structure of exhibition but it by far short to satisfy tourists looking for a deep dive in the past.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Cyprus museum is housed in an old building. It is fairly small and if you’re not an expert you can probably visit all the exhibits in 1 hour. It is organized by periods and by types of artefacts. Periodically, a temporary exhibit is displayed in a special area inside the museum. The museum has free wifi, a cafeteria, and a boutique.",Cyprus Museum
50,I have visited Cyprus museum with my wife and 11 months old daughter and it was well spent time. I was well surprised when we found out that entry is free for everyone. Inside it was plenty of space to move around with a pram and lifts so if you wonder if a visit in Cyprus museum with small kids is a good idea I will tell you it is . There’s loads historic artefacts so if you interested in history it’s a great place to visit.,Cyprus Museum
30,"An extensive presentation of the history of Cyprus and their contact with other nations. But it is such a pity to see it so neglected. Old scripts, barely readable, filthy displays with bad lightings, where so important pieces of the country's history are just lost. The new wing with the Paphos findings should be an example of how the rest of the museum, could have been...",Cyprus Museum
40,Quite nice and lots to see and nice to get out off the heat when you have moaning kids as it was air conditioned,Cyprus Museum
50,"Lots of beatuifull ancient artifact. Allows you to understand Cyprus culture much better. Artifacts from 3000 BC to Roman Empire ones and most famous one Aphrodite statue. But as for me very interesting ones were these ancient ones - oldest, from around 3000 BC and older. So simple but sometimes so close to modern art in symbolic sense.",Cyprus Museum
50,I would like to see the world differently and Cyprus is Good for Visit A soon As possible I want to go there,Cyprus Museum
50,The museum reflects Cyprus history and visitors who appreciate archaeological artifacts will find it an amazing experience,Cyprus Museum
50,This museum is a gem. The Cyprus Terracotta figures are out of this world and some are more than life size. The bronze age and earlier items are fascinating and some of the sculptures are wonderful. A real travel through time from 7000 years ago.You can get a decent look round in an hour or so - so it's not completely overwhelming.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Just today visited the museum after being there many years ago! It is very nice, you can travel through time and enjoy the culture of Cyprus!",Cyprus Museum
40,"Filled with archeological artefacts, statues and relics, but most impressive was the Cyprus Terracotta Army. It took us under an hour to stroll through the museum but we did enjoy the small equestrian antiquities.",Cyprus Museum
50,"One needs more than one day to see everything in detail. All most important artefacts once found during excavations are showed here. A marvel. Hundreds of statues of gods and godesses, terracota, vases... you name it. Surely the highpoint of your visit to Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Museum may seem small, at the first sight, but it has a pretty big collection of ancient sculptures, household items, jewelry, and other items of different epochs. Definitely worth to visit!",Cyprus Museum
50,Some fantastic exhibits. Many of them thousands of years old and undamaged. A real glance back in time.,Cyprus Museum
50,"This extraordinary museum presents the unique, complex history of this Mediterranean island in a comprehensive and comprehensible way. Beginning with the prehistoric periods it presents material in a chronological way and then organized by medium: pottery, sculpture, metals, seals and coins, luxury goods and terracottas. It's a wonderful experience. You'll go back again and again.",Cyprus Museum
30,average place and you would do better museums in other parts of europe. just do this if you have enough time in nicosia and dont know what to do :-),Cyprus Museum
50,I was overwhelmed by many of the exhibits. If you are interested in antiquities don't miss it. You will be pleasantly surprised.The gift shop has a lot of nice presents to buy.,Cyprus Museum
40,"It’s not a huge quantity museum , but the quality of pieces are the soul , you learned more about history and stories of Cyprus. Just take an hour to explore the country , a highly recommend sightseeing in town.",Cyprus Museum
40,Yes the pieces of this museum have been around for a long time and kudos to the responsible civic members who keep it well presented and not over done. There is much that is worth checking out here so allow plenty of time. Each section is well done so if you only have time for a couple sections do them well and come back another time.,Cyprus Museum
50,At €4.50 this is well worth the entry fee. The British Museum may be free but this little museum is a far more manageable size and no less enthralling. And you won’t be left exhausted at the end. It is small and spectacular and very well laid out. It starts with some amazingly preserved ceramics from 3200 BC and goes right up to Greek and Roman gods and Emporers including the majestic bronze statue of Roman emperor Septimius Severus and the enticing Aphrodite nearby. Easy to find near Pafos Gate.,Cyprus Museum
40,"We went to this museum, to avoid the rain, an spent a good hour soaking up some Cypriot history. English translation was available and we could only look in awe at the pieces being exhibited that were thousands dsl of years old.",Cyprus Museum
50,It is a great learning experience. First we learned Swedish and Polish professors helped the archeological explorations. Then we learned the evidence of human activities tracing back to 9000BC! The staff of the museum was nice and helpful.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Great collection of artefacts from Cypriot history, explained in Greek and English. Definitely worth at least an hour visit. Don’t miss the Cypro-syllabic inscriptions and the display of the burial goods, including the weapons and chariot pieces from the royal tombs at Salamis",Cyprus Museum
50,"Compared to many Greek islands we visited in the past, this place was such a great discovery!!!! Not only was the staff very nice and friendly but we learned we did not have to pay the admission of under 5 euros as we visited it on the Museum Day (interestingly we were charged at the Arhiepiscopy where they said the Museum Day was the following day!!!).As you enter you turn right and see numerous artifacts and walk anti clock wise passing several rooms packed with all kind of small and large items, some just discovered in the past decades!!!There is brief information in both English and Greek on some items, I wish more information was provided though.Some amazing statues to mesmerise at and then we started walking in the heat towards Ledra street and nearby attractions. We came by taxi from Limassol with Travel express (which I would recommend to check my review if you want to travel fast and efficient).",Cyprus Museum
40,perfect place to learn Cyprus history and spend some great moments with family and kids. Strongly suggested,Cyprus Museum
40,"Although a small museum, the museum does contain many artefacts. Perhaps the artefacts could have been organised a bit better, as it does feel as if they have put as many items as they can into the exhibits. Still it was the best museum I had visited on the island. Would recommend 30-40 minutes at the museum, more if you are a keen ancient history enthusiast.",Cyprus Museum
30,"It is a very small museum, with a very traditional fare: artifacts behind glass. Do some reading about their collection to see if it interest you at all, because the museum itself is not going to inspire.",Cyprus Museum
50,It’s small but very rich in exhibits. Mike Mia of history are represented by anything from pottery to statues. Especially exciting are the findings of Agria Kyriaki excavation with hundreds of statues displayed as they were found. Definitely worth visiting.,Cyprus Museum
50,Contains the most extensive collection on the island. The Silver Cyprus treasure plates ( some of which are now in New York)are a highlight. Great early Cypriot sculpture and furniture etc,Cyprus Museum
30,"Great collection of artefacts and limestone statues, with thorough descriptions. Unfortunately staff is horrendous: customer service is none existent as the ticket seller was yelling on the phone the all time. Not even Hello!",Cyprus Museum
40,The museum contains incredibly ancient artefacts which impress as they are well kept. It is small and you can easily get round the museum in 30 minutes. Why not visit when arriving in Nicosia?,Cyprus Museum
30,"I was filling in time on a business trip and decided to pay a visit here. The layout of the museum flows nicely, but the content is a bit the same. If you like stone statues and clay pots then this is the place for you!! I really like old stuff so didn't mind too much. It's was also only about 4/5 euros to get it, and it killed an hour of my time.I have to say though that the guy who sold me my ticket was exceptionally miserable and very unfriendly. Oh well you can't have it all......",Cyprus Museum
50,"The exhibition is well organised and displays artefacts, which can not be found anywhere else in the world.Some descriptions need an update, but overall it is just great!",Cyprus Museum
50,"Beautifully exhibited artefacts, with descriptions in Greek and English. They were chronologically presented, well lit and easy to follow",Cyprus Museum
40,Leave at least an hour to enjoy this museum as there is so much there and all descriptions are so well done.,Cyprus Museum
20,I wanted to find out about the history of Cyprus and this was not the place. Received quite a hostile welcome and didn't receive any information so we walked around and read the limited information on cards inside the exhibit cases. A lot of pots but there was no clear explanations as to what most of them were - it could have been better and I thought it was expensive. Good for archeology fans but not for the social history that I was after - the museum of the national struggle was far more informative (and free).,Cyprus Museum
50,"An excellent museum full of fascinating exhibits from the Hellenistic, Roman and Greek eras. Very modern, well laid out museum where exhibits are displayed to maximum effect. Highlights include their very own ""terracotta army"", artefacts showing the links with and influence of Ptolemy and a fascinating bust of Caligula. Limited gift shop but facilities include good toilets and free lockers for back packs/bags etc.I do think this museum is under publicised and under rated which is reflected by the very cheap entrance fee. Highlight of the Greek side of Nicosia for us.",Cyprus Museum
50,Small and filled with archeological treasures. I never was a fan of pottery but this museum seems to be filled with the perfect and beautiful. If you are interested in history this is for you.,Cyprus Museum
30,"I might not be the type for this kind of museums. What I would expect was a good overview of the different ages including timespans and so on..the museum itself is surprisingly big, but it did not impress me too much. I suppose for archaeology lovers a must.",Cyprus Museum
40,A place where you can learn the development of the island. From the beginning of life until know. Lot of things from different countries because of the position of the island and there inpuct,Cyprus Museum
50,Went for day to Nicosia if you like history agood place to vist very busy plenty of places to enjoy a good meal the locals are very friendly will vist again when we vist Cyprus again,Cyprus Museum
30,"There is a good chance you ll find the museum empty.Nice (very nice?) collection but no guide to explore, explain and understand...",Cyprus Museum
50,Very interesting museum with loads of useful information for the vast history of Cyprus. Should have been better advertised...!,Cyprus Museum
50,It is a very interesting museum with lot of historical evidence and archeological remains going back in the history of Cyprus thirteen thousand years before today. I spent three hours and I enjoyed very much the evolution as was unfolded in the display of so many artifacts of the past and the route of the local development. Very interesting.,Cyprus Museum
50,Easy to walk! Very well organized! You will be surprised with the objects there that are exposed!It does not take more than two the visit!Impressed!,Cyprus Museum
40,Visit to the Cyprus Museum is a must if you want to learn about the history of Cyprus. They have pots and utensils from different time periods along with sculptures.I spent about 1.5 hours. Time well spent.,Cyprus Museum
50,"The museum has a nice collection of items dating back thousands of years, mainly pottery, decorations and statues. There are not many descriptions, but much of the material is fairly self-explanatory. The whole place takes about 1-2 hours to see. Highly recommended for anyone interested in ancient relics!",Cyprus Museum
50,"From the Neolithic period through Early Bronze age, Cypro archaic and classical, Hellenistic and Roman, the museum bursts with impressive exhibits of each period.Not to miss, depending on your interest, the statues of Aphrodite - symbol of Cyprus,Adonis, Athena, Artemis, Eros and Psyche and a unique limestone head of Alexander the Great.Also unmissable, the display of the Aya Irini sanctuary, beautifully presented with hundreds of statues arranged in a large semi circle and looking at you..The small but well formed building is full of architectural charm, inviting you to enterthrough a 4 columns front. Just wander..Guides are available and a small museum shop too.The museum will give you a complete overview of the cultural heritage which could help one understand clearly the chronology, diversity and influence on Cyprus history.",Cyprus Museum
50,"The exhibits in this relatively small museum are of an extremely high standard and despite the many treasures that various occupiers have plundered and taken back to Europe, there are marvels which you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else in the world.My recommendation would be to start any holiday in Cyprus at this museum to give an insight into the many cultures that have left their mark on this tiny island.",Cyprus Museum
40,"Very varied and interesting exhibits. Nice to see such a rich display of culture on offer. The written explaimations of items was clear, easy to read and informative. The iron Age Jewery and pottery displayed was incredible. A very enjoyable couple of hours.",Cyprus Museum
50,Interesting displayed and exhibitions. A wide array of antiques from across the whole island. The antiques are in very good condition and are well kept and looked after. This museum takes you back in time.,Cyprus Museum
50,Beautiful morning at the Cyprus Museum! An extensive collection of history with the most amazing collection of terracotta figurines found in the Sanctuary of Ayia Irini! That was my highlight! Everyone should visit and contribute!,Cyprus Museum
50,"A great spot to see and understand the long, ancient history of Cyprus and be stunned by the amazing exhibitions of relics that were collected through various excavations",Cyprus Museum
40,"This is a small museum but has under one roof one of the longest and most diverse history found in any place of earth in a relatively small area that is the island of Cyprus. You will see small and larger exhibits from various periods of the antiquity that have been unearthed all over the island and testify to the fact that Cyprus has been in the crossroads of three continents and many civilizations. Some video projections highlight the early years of archeology and how Cyprus used to be 100 or so years ago. If you stop and look at some of seemingly not so exciting exhibits you will appreciate the detail, artistic quality, and especially the wealth of information they offer about the life and culture of people in the last few thousand years. You will not be bored as the walk through the museum takes about 1 hour and you pass through the different historic periods, all very concentrated. Then you have to also go visit some of the excavation sites where all these exhibits came from, in order to fully appreciate them!",Cyprus Museum
40,"Relatively small museum that will take you about an hour to see, longer if you stop to read each plaque.The objects found at the archaeological sites on Cyprus are on display here (those that weren't taken to England or smuggled abroad). Some lovely examples of culture over the last 10,000 years. Very glad we went here before visiting the sites at Pafos.€4,50 for adults. Well worth it!Small gift shop with quality items. Free parking, toilets and lockers available.",Cyprus Museum
50,"An incredible exposition covering the entire history of the Cyprus from stone age.And you can see incredible, interesting and valuable things. And yet I understood that Aphrodite is a mighty goddess who rules this island 5 and maybe 7 thousand years :) !",Cyprus Museum
40,An interesting guided tour through cypriot history. Very beautiful artifacts and well exhibited. Every Tuesday is a free guided tour at 11:00.,Cyprus Museum
50,"The museum isn't very big, but it is packed with a huge collection of prehistoric and ancient artefacts. A wonderful way to learn about Cyprus's ancient past!",Cyprus Museum
40,"The Nicosia Archaeological Museum is the number one place of interest for the Cyprus history buff. It is a place not to be missed. The civilisation of Cyprus of the last 9.500 years is condensed and exhibited in the fourteen rooms of the museum.In these rooms the visitor can study the exhibits pertaining to the Neolithic Period, the Early Bronze Age, the pottery of the Middle and Late Bronze Age, the terracotta figurines found in Agia Irini Sanctuary, metallurgy, to name but a few.Entrance is only € 4,50 and one can use one’s ticket for as many visits on the day that the ticket was issued, as one likes.Certainly a place well worth a visit.",Cyprus Museum
50,"If you have any interest in prehistoric or early history then this is an unmissable museum. The collection contains a significant part of the collections of artefacts from north and south cyprus' ancient sites. Well displayed with labels for most in English.I simply cannot understand that the collection of clay figurines, some are life-sized, from the sanctuary of St Irene, which are rather like a smaller ancient Greek version of the terracotta army, are not more famous.",Cyprus Museum
50,Although small it covers the history of Cyprus in detail. Very informative and full of wonderful pieces. Staff could have been more helpful but it wasn't a problem,Cyprus Museum
50,"There is a lot of history packed into this small museum. The history stretches back 6,000 years to the earlier settlements. The rooms artifacts, pottery, figurines and statues from various periods of Cyprus' history. The statues of Zues and Aphrodite are worth seeing. I also enjoyed the 1,000 plus figurines found in one site called Agis Elrini.",Cyprus Museum
50,A place that needs time devoted in order to see and enjoy all that is on display from the history of ancient Cyprus.,Cyprus Museum
50,An excellent musuem. Worth a guided tour. look out for the free torutr days. well layed out with good english descriptions,Cyprus Museum
40,"If you are in there keep and mind to visit the museum only 4,5 euro and you can enjoy all the history I spent like 1,30 hour I loved it and enjoyed it so keep in mind to learn watch see , as I did be part of the place know about the history of Cyprus",Cyprus Museum
50,"If you have any interest in history , visit this fantastic museum opened in 1908 in the name of Queen Victoria. Fantastic jewellery , pots , tools and art . There is a gift shop , toilets inside , and statues and the like in the gardens surrounding the museum.",Cyprus Museum
40,"The Cyprus Museum is situated in a beautiful Victorian-era building, just outside of the walls of the 'old city' of Nicosia. Well worth the visit to get a better understanding of the 10,000 year history of this amazing eastern-medtieranean island gem, with displayed antiquities ranging from the Neolithic to Roman periods. The exhibits are well-signed, and also have notations in English. Take the time to watch the video presentation regarding Swedish Cyprus archaeological expedition, conducted between 1927 and 1931.",Cyprus Museum
50,Very interesting as it has many Ancient Greek antiquities of Cyprus presenting Cyprus's history. It is definitely worth visiting,Cyprus Museum
50,What an amazing place! A beautiful old building containing historical and archeological artifacts dating back thousands of years. If you want to know Cyprus start here! It is truly one of the most storied countries on earth!,Cyprus Museum
50,Great place that you can see the Greek and historical heritage of the island.A must visit site in Nicosia.,Cyprus Museum
50,The ruins in this museum tell the story of civilization. It's a small museum and can be toured in less than an hour. It's a must see for anyone interested in classical history or archaeology/,Cyprus Museum
50,"This museum has artefacts from around 5000BC to a couple of centuries ago relating to life on Cyprus. It's well arranged in chronological date order (oldest first) for the most part. It's own terracotta 'soldiers', and some setups of discovered tombs and what was found. A little bite of history, not expensive and a bit of relief from 38 degrees too!",Cyprus Museum
50,"Tremendous museum, one of the best I have been in for some time. Stunning collection. Top sight in Lefkosia",Cyprus Museum
40,It is very big museum with lots of historical objects.its a day trip so be there early morning.you can spend hours there and still not finish your visit.,Cyprus Museum
30,Interesting but guide needed if you are uneducated on the history displayed by museum and not ideal for teenagers - they will get bored.,Cyprus Museum
40,"The museum is very old like the historical sculptures insideCyprus island has great history so this museum is a very good opportunity to visit and enjoy all of these historical items.Gold and silver jewelries , sculptures from marble and bronze and lots of other historical treasures",Cyprus Museum
40,"on fridays the museum hosts a free guided tour (1,5h) of the museum.The guide was good, and really made the exhibits come to life.However, if we had been on our own, it would have been less interesting, and more difficult as many signs are exclusively in greek.",Cyprus Museum
30,No guide there but it is required.Superb collection (I guess?) but little explanation written.Worse the time you ll spend there,Cyprus Museum
30,Not bad. Im sure there is more history than what they have to offer.Ive visited museums around europe and to my opinion its a very amateur set up. They didn't use their imagination to give a challenging apeal to it.,Cyprus Museum
50,"The museum is full of very interesting finds with a lot of history attached to them. I would be a good idea to read up on them. The museum also has two explorer packs for children, one on ancient beasts and one on Aphrodite. The kids get a booklet, a torch, a magical belt, etc and have to find the items on their list, which also gives a brief, child-friendly description of the artifact. I took my son and his friends there before my son's fifth birthday and they loved it!",Cyprus Museum
50,We were on a guided tour with a guide who gave us excellent information about the building housing the museum and its contents. Some sad stories about the invasions over the centuries with boys and girls being torn from parents to become soldiers of members of harem's.,Cyprus Museum
40,"We had a bit of a circuitous journey but finally found the Cyprus Archaeological Museum not far from the Paphos gate.The entrance cost is 4.50 euros. Inside is a wealth of ancient artifacts from the Neolithic period onwards. There is a lot of pottery, weaponry, writing tablets, tombstones and a lot of great sculpture all discovered in Cyprus. One of the highlights is the display of clay figures from around an altar at Agia Irini. Very interesting if archaeology is your thing.",Cyprus Museum
50,Lots of Cypriot history lay it out in a sophisticated manner. The Museum is very near within the walking distance of the city center.,Cyprus Museum
50,It's amazing and definitely worth a visit when in Cyprus. You come out with so much historic information and much more knowledgeable.,Cyprus Museum
40,"The museum has a great collection of goods that describe the history of Cyprus. You can get to know almost everything of Cyprus in this museum. Although, it does need to have a little renovation.",Cyprus Museum
40,"This relatively small archaeological museum is a real gem that is well worth the admission fee and a couple of hours of your time when in Nicosia. At the time of writing local tourist board guides were giving 1.5 hour guided tours starting at 11:00 on Tuesday and Friday at no additional cost after the admission fee. Our guide was well informed and made the visit far more interesting, and so you may wish to check with the local tourist board as to when these tours are available when you visit..",Cyprus Museum
40,"All you want to know about the history of Cyprus is there, very informative, Friendly staff. Worth a visit.",Cyprus Museum
30,"Nicosia's principal museum, holds a great collection but in urgent need of a renovation/relocation. visited numerous times on different occasions and staff service varies. closed one day of the week and this is unacceptable for a tourist island and it's principal museum in the capital city.",Cyprus Museum
50,If you want to find out about the history of Cyprus this is a must place to visit along with the other attractions in the area it gives you a great understanding of the island.,Cyprus Museum
50,"If you have a spare time don't hesitate to visit the Cyprus Museum, it have lots of interesting stuff and it worth it!",Cyprus Museum
50,"Had some time to spare while downtown, Lots of great history of Cyprus. Lots to see. Worth a trip to the Museum.",Cyprus Museum
50,"A wonderful surprise. The pieces are unique and very interesting, the collection is exhibited in a tasteful and not overwhelming manner. There is AC, so you can visit it during hot hours of the day. One of the best things to see on Cyprus...",Cyprus Museum
50,"Not a huge museum (which, frankly, is a good thing) but full of fascinating items - the terracotta figures are possibly the highlight however the carved lions, the gold jewellery and the busts are all amazing. Even if you do nothing else on the cultural front in this city then this is a must!",Cyprus Museum
30,"Impressive display of the artifacts unearthed at various archeological sites around Cyprus. Pottery, funerary, votives. Well described in English.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Its the largest arch. museum of Cyprus. Covers the history of Cyprus thru excibits from 11,200 BC until Roman to early Byzantine years.",Cyprus Museum
50,"The objects here cover all periods of Cypriot prehistory and ancient history. It really shows well the sheer vibrancy of the various cultures which have evolved on the island. It is methodically laid out by period,and well-presented in both Greek and English, but not to the point of information overload. It is rather old-fashioned, but that does not detract from the quality of the artefacts. The room of statues shows the many different cultural dress styles and racial diversity through time. I especially liked the Mycenaean ceramics and the Late Bronze Age horse trappings. But perhaps best of all are the many ceramics showing daily activities. Yet another must-see attraction.",Cyprus Museum
40,A place that every visitor has to go. There you can find the culture development in Cyprus from the past unti today.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Big enough to hold numerous interesting objects and displays, all set out in way that makes progress through the museum easy and enjoyable. There are enough things to either hold your attention for a while, or allow you to to skim through the larger collections taking in the highlights. Always a good sign of a museum if you can dictate your own pace going through to the end, but feel you haven't missed anything of note or interest. This museum certainly allows that. Well worth a visit.",Cyprus Museum
50,Small compared to other national museums but well designed interior with great collections spanning the ancient history of Cyprus. Nice small garden and a coffee shop outside. Enjoyed a cup of coffee while sitting in the garden next to old sculptures.,Cyprus Museum
50,"For such a small island it's surprising at the high yield, quality and diversity of the archeological artifacts displayed at the museum . The museum manages to ,bring to light the ancient history of the island and its people . Some incredible peices displayed here ,found myself lingering much longer than expected . Absolutely worthy of a visit . Well presented and adequate information displayed . An audio would have been a bonus and more revenue for the museum .",Cyprus Museum
40,"If you're at all interested in Cypriot antiquities, this museum is not optional. However, you should be forewarned that not all of the labels go with the right items, and many that are the correct ones are placed at a distance from the objects that they describe. Probably the best rooms in the museum are often missed because they are off the main loop; from the room with lots of metals, head up the stairs in order to see the remarkably well preserved furniture from 8th c. BC tombs at Salamis.",Cyprus Museum
40,Great place to visit with lots to see and to understand Cyprus history. Not the biggest museum but perfectly formed with a great layout.,Cyprus Museum
50,"This is a stunning museum, not too large, very well laid-out and full of most impressive artefacts. Compares favourably with the very best elsewhere. Well-preserved exhibits such as I have not seen elsewhere in a cleverly laid-out environment.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Not very far on quality when compared to the Athens counterpart. For me, the best Nicosia attraction if you love ancient civilizations history.",Cyprus Museum
50,"We've travelled a lot around the world with our two young sons. The little ""explorer's box"" that this museum put together for their youngest visitors is pure genius! We all enjoyed our time here.",Cyprus Museum
40,Whilst this museum may be fairly modest in size it has some wonderful exhibits. Entry is 4.50 euros and children go free. There are some very interesting items from prehistoric times to Byzantine Cyprus with many statues from the Hellenic and Roman period. The 2000 figures unearthed are pretty unique I would say and the bronze of Septimus Severus is really impressive. There's a little cafe in the grounds too. All in all a very enjoyable museum that kept both kids and adults happy.,Cyprus Museum
30,We were on an organised trip to the area and brought in here. Interesting look at the history of Cyprus if you like that sort of thing. Pretty well laid out museum and plenty of artifacts to see. Difficult to be ushered around with fifty other people so may have missed hearing about some of the significant facts. Worth a visit but not my kind of thing.,Cyprus Museum
40,This is a well laid out archaeological museum.Full of statues and artefacts from ancient times.Principally for those who are interested in this sort of object.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Very rich museum, memorable logic of the galleries placement, according to historic timeline, separate displays for the history of theater, etc.",Cyprus Museum
50,Cyprus museum is a place that you must visit you will see all the history of cypurs there is a great collection,Cyprus Museum
50,This is a great collection of Cypriot artefacts. Especially as I have already been to Choirokitia and now I was able to see the many artefacts found there. It completed the picture. This museum is compact and has a lor in one spot.,Cyprus Museum
40,"For somebody visiting a country , surely except from the other attractions it offers, a visit to such a place is a must. It keeps you in line with the history of the country and appreciate different cultures and traditions .....",Cyprus Museum
40,"Visited fast because of lack of time but really interesting, even the building is really nice.It closes early but great place still",Cyprus Museum
30,"Nice collection of historical artifacts from the oldest part of Cyprus, along with some tomb excavations and Greek/Roman statues. A modest but diverse museum, my only complaint would be that it's a bit dated. Still worth seeing, the price is low and the artifatcs on display were relevant to us as after the visit to the museum we went to the Choirokoitia, where some of them were found.",Cyprus Museum
40,"The museum in on the Aphrodite cultural route and a must for international culture lovers. It is rich with artefacts dating from the Neolithic up to and beyond the Greco-Roman eras. The statue of Aphrodite of Soloi, gold relics and jewellery from the tombs of Salamis are some of the treasures worth seeing. This museum is dedicated solely to Cypriot archaeology but the findings show considerable influences and links with nearby ancient civilisations such as the Phoenicians, the Assyrians, the Egyptians, the Greeks (of course) and others. It is not very big and definitely worth a visit if you are in the neighbourhood. You can also visit other interesting places nearby such the Leventis gallery and by the end of this year, the by then finished new modern Eleftheria (Freedom) Square, the Ledra crossing point to the Turkish occupied areas and others.",Cyprus Museum
40,The main archaeological museum of Cyprus..Small but rich in culture and history of Cyprus over millennia.,Cyprus Museum
40,"The exhibition opens with pottery, small artefacts and explanations of ancient history. However it is the subsequent display of statues which is the most striking. This part of the exhibition starts with Cyprus's own Terracotta Army and moves on through a fine display of later exhibits. The fact that they are limestone rather than marble somehow makes them much more lifelike.Also don't miss the side exhibitions on the right just before the children's play area. In addition to the exhibition of tomb architecture there was a very interesting display on the work of Polish archaeological teams over the last fifty years. This exhibition was advertised as running from May to November. It was in January when we saw it so it may well be replaced soon.The exhibits are logically displayed with everything labled in Greek and English. There are moves to provide an audio guide which I feel will be a valuable enhancement.The picture shows the museum entrance.",Cyprus Museum
40,"This museum should not be missed! For a mere 5.50 E, you gain access to the most stunning exhibits, virtually all of which are local in origin - something that adds further to the the exciting nature of the experience. Do not be put off by the lackluster web pages, and do make sure you allow enough time to explore every nook and cranny - some of the best things seem to be half-hidden. There is scope for presenting some of the exhibits in a more eye-catching way, but visitors will be rewarded for their persistence! Amongst the most impressive exhibits are the numerous statues of different sizes discovered in Ayia Irini, and some of the Nea Paphos artifacts, excavated in collaboration with a Polish University over a fifty year period.It is best to allocate a whole afternoon, if not perhaps an entire day, to be able to take in the entire wealth of the exhibits on display. Visiting in January, I found myself to be the sole visitor over most of the afternoon - although during the tourist season the situation may be rather different.",Cyprus Museum
30,"Plenty of pots,bowls and jewellery on show as well as a whole floor dedicated to the British rule.There was also a very nice exhibition of wedding dresses through the ages, I believe this is temporary.My only minor criticism is we found it too hot in there and were pleased to get to the fresh air !",Cyprus Museum
40,"Had a fun hour or so walking around the museum. Nice to see how crafts have changed, could do with more explanations or booklets etc.",Cyprus Museum
40,A museum that worth seeing and doesn't take more than 2-3 hours (or a half day if you are really interested). The quality of some of the early examples of pottery are quite incredible. There is also a colouring station for young children towards the end.,Cyprus Museum
30,"A museum with some old stuff like pottery, coins, tools etc. Not a very big place where you could spend many hours but a nice place to visit when you have some spare time. When I went a lady guide was explaining things very loudly to her clients which were noisy and annoying. Especially that group of people were blocking the way for the others in all the possible manners. So for me, it wasn't a very good experience, but this place is a nice place to visit when you have some spare time. Don't make plans to visit here (not that worthy), just go when you have some spare time.",Cyprus Museum
40,"This museum has so much antiques, from Stone Age till recent times. It's very interesting to see figurines and scenes from several thousand years ago. The guides are knowledgeable.It has great variety due to Cyprus varies history. Highly recommended.",Cyprus Museum
50,A must to visit for an in depth view on the history of this beautiful island. So many interesting artifacts and their background.Cyprus truly is an Ancient island of human history. When you come here the story begins to unfold.,Cyprus Museum
40,An excellent museum with a great collection of archelogical finds in Cyprus. There you can see the famous Aphrodite statue,Cyprus Museum
50,Cyprus Museum is in the center of Nicosia and it is very easy to find. It is a really quite place and full of exhibits from many eras of the history of Cyprus. Very interesting. For all ages. We spend there almost 2 hours. We have no guide but we did not need it probably because there were explanation boxes for every exhibit. It is worth the visit and your time.The only negative thing that I would mention is that the stuff was some times a little loudy and that was irritating because the place was very quite in general.,Cyprus Museum
40,"Cyprus history under one roof, at least ancient history that is. Extensive range of items, statues, pottery and coinage, defines the origins of the country and its people. Definitely worth a visit with the family.",Cyprus Museum
50,Everyone turist or local must to visit the cypriot museums !!! There u can find a lot of history !!!,Cyprus Museum
50,"Cyprus has a wonderful history with a consequentially huge and varied quantity of artifacts spanning numerous dynasties / genre. This museum has an excellent selection, well displayed.",Cyprus Museum
50,"The museum is set up in different sections for different types of art from local artists to world famous artists. I was particularly impressed with the impressionistic art exhibit. There were paintings by Marc Chagall, Monet and Pissarro. Some of the Greek artists I saw featured in the museum had artwork in the churches we visited which tied things together nicely. This museum is definitely worth spending some time in.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Cyprus Museum (Archaeological) is the islands foremost museum located in Lefkosia. The museum was founded in 1888 and houses archaeological treasures of Cyprus with 14 galleries of original art pieces from the Neolithic 9th millennium BC to the Byzantine periods.

50,This museum is a MUST when you visit Cyprus and Nicosia. All the artifacts are so numerous that you need to visit it several times. It is very easy to follow as there is a chronological order in the different rooms.The Cypriot antiquities and the treasures date from the Neolithic Age to the Early Byzantine period.,Cyprus Museum
50,This is where Cyprus is keeping its 6000 years of history. Small but good. Unfortunately due to the miss interest of all governments on the Island it does not have the image that it should.build ed by the British colony nothing was done to expand it.,Cyprus Museum
50,"A well laid out museum, very interesting, the guide [Evi} was so good, I found out a lot about Cyprus and where the excavations have been done. I shall go back at the end of my stay when I've visited some of the sites. Welcoming staff, open air cafe where I had my first Cyprian coffee",Cyprus Museum
40,This was my first time visiting a museum which its history is greek oriented. I liked this museum.The price is 4/5€ for each adult. There is no guid but the information tags are clear and easy to understood.,Cyprus Museum
40,The museum (that it's building is so old that could be in a museum itself...) is giving the visitor a really nice view and understanding of the history of Cyprus since the ancient times... Thousands of years B.C. There are also two educational routes that you can follow with your children for free. Just ask for the materials at the entrance.,Cyprus Museum
50,Visited the museum with the family and we spent lots of time wondering around gathering a great appreciation for the amazing history of Cyprus. So much to see in this museum.,Cyprus Museum
50,"In this museum you will find artefacts from the Neolithic period to the Roman period. The displays are arranged in chronological order. We arrived in time to have a guided tour. This service was free and greatly increased our understanding of each display. The ""Lady of Lemba"" famous cruciform figure is on display with other Chalcolithic figurines. The terracotta figurines are amazing. So much to see. I highly recommend visiting the museum.",Cyprus Museum
30,"I visited the Cyprus Museum with two friends in October. Although the exhibits were interesting and gave some good insight into the various Roman, Greek and Venetian influences on Cypriot culture, there wasnt really and guidance or order to the displays, which made it difficult to really appreciate what was on show.",Cyprus Museum
40,I visited the Cyprus museum whilst in Nicosia on business recently and was pleasantly surprised at its excellent collection. It holds only pieces found on the island and the terracotta votive statues are a particular highlight of the museum. The collection represents many of the different periods of history of the island and should be a must stop on any visitors list whilst in the city.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Very important collection of ancient objects, nice vitrines, good explications. Not at all a lot of visitor. You need 2 hours for the visit.",Cyprus Museum
40,"The museum has a wide range of archaeological material from sites around the island. Highlights are the Archaic ceramic sculptures and the furniture. Lighting isn't always very good, sadly, which makes taking good photos a little hit or miss.",Cyprus Museum
50,Amazing how such a small island can hold such a rich history. Trying to pack that in to one place is impossible but this museum gives it a decent try.,Cyprus Museum
20,InterestingSome beautiful piecesInformation provided at times a little sketchy and not sure if it accuracy,Cyprus Museum
30,"This is really a shame, that such a great and valuable exhibits of ancient Cyprus could be shown in this manner. The museum really has a lot of amazing exhibits, some of them in the really good shape. However, the museum building from inside feels like prison. The rooms are small and dark and cases with exhibits are dirty and dusty from inside with very limited lighting. If the same would have been shown anywhere else like London or Paris, these would look completely different. Also there are no good explanations or any modern technology supporting the exhibition. I don't think I will come back again.",Cyprus Museum
40,"i recommend it to all visitors of Nicosia who are interested in Cyprus archaeology and history. It covers the history of the island from the very early stages from many archeological excavations with beautiful artifacts, rare, not to be seen in other museums.",Cyprus Museum
50,A very good museum with a free parking -if you know it.A good experience if you like history and culture .,Cyprus Museum
30,"A very interesting museum that includes several findings of ancient times in Cyprus! Very interesting to see how different cultures impact the everyday life and art in Cyprus. However, most of the exhibits didn't have explanatory texts.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Since Cyprus' History is primarily associated with Conflicts, Wars and Occupations, the Cyprus Archeological Museum provides an outstanding relief: for it demonstrates the creativity of the Cypriot people, their fine taste and their cultural achievements for 10 thousand years! Therefore, do set aside at least a couple of hours to absorb as much as possible, and if you can, listen to a knowledgeable guide, as we did today that we were lucky to meet Jeanette.",Cyprus Museum
40,Museum provides a good overview of the complex and varied past cultures of Cyprus. The undoubted highlight is the display of terracotta votive statues. The nearby audio visual covering the Swedish archeological expedition adds to the general understanding of such discoveries in Cyprus. The section on Nea Pathos adds detail to anybody who has visited the site itself.,Cyprus Museum
30,Not the greatest collection of stuff from Cyprus and the condition of the building is dated. You will probably find better items from Cyprus in the British Museum or the Louvre,Cyprus Museum
40,"Museums may be a particular venue to visit. One must dedicate the time to go around and peruse what is on display, more so if one drops in with specific intents. We only had a day available for Nicosia, so the visit to the Cyprus Museum had to be well bracketed. Fortunately for us, the Museum could be done in under a couple of hours, even when the exhibits are actually worth poring over. Cyprus is rich in the ancient history of the Mediterranean, and its archaeological trove is one of the most intriguing. The highly ornate pottery ware, the intricate statuettes, the designed metal utensils all indicate a sophisticated lifestyle to complement the ancient ruins and mosaic floors of Cypriot archaeology. The museum is well organised and visitor friendly with captions and explanations in English to complete the Greek. Surely a cultural highlight for Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
50,An unexpected visit to the museum with freinds. So much to see amd lots of precious objects. Kept us all busy and interested for a good part of the day.Young children may get bored here and probably not a good idea taking them if you want to enjoy the museum yourself.,Cyprus Museum
50,This museum has been supporting conducting professional archaelogical digs and publications for many decades. The finds displayed are outstanding and have consistently excellent English signage. Visit here for a crash course in the long and complicated history of Cyprus. There is a pleasant coffee shop in the shady gardens too.,Cyprus Museum
50,"The largest archeological museum in the island. Its collections starts from the Neolithic Era onwards to the Roman if not mistaken! It may lack the grand statues of the huge museums we are more familiar, however it contains beautiful findings of the archeological world. Just outside of the old city walls. A nice museum to spent an afternoon! Enjoy",Cyprus Museum
50,"This is definitely worth a visit, even if only to hide from the sun. You can explore Cyprus' incredible past, which stretches back thousands of years!Very much a classic museum (so don't expect lots of interactive exhibits), but very informative and full of friendly staff. Easily accessible by foot from the centre of Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
50,Amazing place if you are interested in archeology or history.Most of the exhibits date back 3.5 - 6 thousand years. Cyprus has a history close to 10 thousand years of continued human habitation.,Cyprus Museum
50,"good for a hot or rainy day, a/c works very well. Very quiet and neat with a beautiful shop to buy quality souvenirs deriving from the rich history of the Island.A short walk from downtown Nicosia the last divided Capital of Europe. Staff is very friendly,entrance fee is very cheap. Beautiful old building , items very very interesting....I will definetely go there again",Cyprus Museum
50,"The Museum of Cyprus houses some of the most exquisite examples of the archaeological history of Cyprus that stretches from 11,000 BC to the present day. Here one can see examples of Neolithic, copper and bronze age art through to the Hellenistic and Roman period. Apparently a new Museum is been built and hopefully when this new facility is finished top curators and designers will be found who will not only carefully place and light the exhibits but also write informative labels. Hopefully also tour guides will be instructed to answer correctly as during my visit a British visitor asked one where the original settlers of Cyprus came from in the Neolithic period. She said that they were originally intrepid travellers but came from the Aegean and el.sewhere. This is a politically loaded answer as the settlers were Semites who settled in Cyprus in places like Chirokitia long before the Greeks settled on the mainland Greek peninsular and then traveled south to Cyprus 2500 BC. What you had in Cyprus was the colonization of the indigenous people by a superior culture like the English Celts whose culture was supplanted by that of the Saxons. Isn’t historical DNA profiling brilliant? This museum collection and its library is a treasure that is worth preserving for future generations to view and study.",Cyprus Museum
50,"I have been going to the Museum for many years. Absolutely love it , I've learned about the history of my ancestors . Having been born and lived in England all my life, had no idea of the rich culture and history of this small island. So much on display , it's well presented , and in a beautiful colonial part of Nicosia .however,if visiting indepentately , avoid the days the coach trips go ! Gets very crowded. Best to go on a Sunday morning .",Cyprus Museum

50,"I'm not an archaeologist and I know nothing about historical artefacts but I couldn't help but go 'wow' and calling my kids 'have a look at this!' Unbelievable collection of pottery, coins, statues that shows this history of this beautiful island over the past few thousand years. And it's air conditioned!!",Cyprus Museum
50,"The Cyprus museum has exhibits from ancient Cyprus, from the Stone Age towards early Christianity. It's well kept although it has room for improvement.It's the best place to be if you want to get the whole picture on this beautiful island that's history goes back 4000 years ago.",Cyprus Museum
50,"I truly love the Cyprus Museum! It has an extraordinary and varied collection of antiquities, going back as far as the 14th century BC. The interpretation of many of the exhibits is fascinating, revealing the story of how archaeological finds were made and objects restored and preserved. You will come away with not only a greater appreciation for Cyprus, but for humanity and its achievements and evolution.",Cyprus Museum
40,"Visited the museum in July 2016. The admission is €4.50 ,students are free! Although in need of some renovation in certain areas of the museum, there is a vast collection of archaeological items excavated from different sites in Cyprus. One can find curious artefacts. It would have been nice to have a plan of the museum to better understand the different periods/timeline in which the artefacts were displayed.I highly recommend this museum for history lovers.",Cyprus Museum
50,It looks small from outside but if you like to visit for a first time ask for a tour guide if there is one available ;this will help you understand this long history of this beautiful small island of cyprus ;A great number of exhibits and many more stored in the basement because there is no space to show them .So many different civilizations passed from the island and you can see and admire .,Cyprus Museum
30,"A superb collection but lacking modern contextual interpretation. It's well worth an hour of your time, however it's a old fashioned museum with lots of amazing objects but minimalist labelling.",Cyprus Museum
30,"It is not the greatest museum in the world, but it has some real gems and showcases the great archaeological finds from Cyprus. It is not ordered in the best way perhaps and could be a little more narrative, but it isn't bad.",Cyprus Museum
40,Full of rooms JAMMED with history artifacts from the many cultures of Cyprus. Some of the exhibits are kind of old-fashioned--think pots in a glass box--and not always easy to photograph.,Cyprus Museum
50,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here - I knew nothing about the museum before I visited and was incredibly impressed with the collection. The staff were friendly and helpful, the exhibits were well organised and the general atmosphere was calm and amenable to a slow walk around the sights.",Cyprus Museum
50,"I had a truly wonderful guide there that explained much more that the content of the museum. Unfortunately, I dont remember her name, but if you have a good guide you will enjoy it and learn the history of the island, if not maybe you can skip it.",Cyprus Museum
40,"I visited the museum with a group of friends in July. It was really hot in Nicosia, so the museum was a great place to have a break from the sun and learn some history. The tickets aren't expensive and there were hardly any visitors at noon.",Cyprus Museum
40,Excellent museum. The history of Cyprus is extraordinary. The different eras are enlightening and you get a sense of the many cultures that have influenced the country.The museum is very small and you will be in and out in less than 30 minutes. But a must see.,Cyprus Museum
50,"If you're interested in the history of the island from the very early times on, this museum has it all, and offers a trip through times.",Cyprus Museum
50,"The place to find out all about the ancient history of Cyprus. Numerous pieces of great interest, and very well laid out. Wasn't as big as I'd thought it would be. Visiting the museum on a week's holiday in Northern Cyprus, it was really refreshing to be able to buy a book about the place that gave you in depth information - something that is almost non-existent in the northern side of the island.Well worth a visit for a couple of hours.",Cyprus Museum
20,"It was a treasure trove of exhibits on display (including a bed-frame claimed to be 2000 years old...) and the conservators probably have even more of them not on display. Yet the building has clearly become too old & small to display the archeological finds.Some of the displays were in odd shaped basement rooms. Sarcophagi, for instance, barely had enough aisle room on either side for one to walk past them without kicking them. (See picture. And, no, didn't personally try any of them for size.)In some windowed rooms the lighting might be an issue on less sunny days too.Generally, the material was really good (including explanations in English -- e.g. translated steles written in ancient Cypriot alphabet into modern Greek & English). They just need more space.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This is a small museum, but very well put together. Excellent examples of ancient pottery, sculpture, jewelry-making, and gravesites. Nearly every exhibit has a description in English, with only a few slips - many items were labeled as from the ""Roman Era,"" so I asked a guard when was the Roman era, and he explained that it was from 5,000 B.C. to 200 A.D., obviously an incorrect answer - the museum would have done better to give the dates for all items instead of labeling them ""Roman era"" or ""Hellenistic era."" Only 1 case had no labels at all. These were rare and minor slips - in general the museum is a little gem.",Cyprus Museum
30,"It's a small museum with artefacts from all over Cyprus. There are no audioguides so the information you get is limited to what their labels say (where it was excavated, its date, etc.) thus you do not get a depth or story from the artefacts. I think it is worth seeing if you are interested in Cypriot history and if you have some extra time to spend in Nicosia.A visit here will take approximately an hour or so.",Cyprus Museum
50,a small but well organised museum in the centre of Nicosia in a nice area opposite to the theatre of the town,Cyprus Museum
50,"Lovely museum with many exhibits and identify the way of life of Cypriot, religion , art,civilization. Located in the center of Nicosia",Cyprus Museum
40,We went on a selfguided tour on a Sunday afternoon. It was a good time to visit with few tourists. An interesting exebition of artifacts depicting the Islands history.Well worth a visit & pluss for friendly staff👍,Cyprus Museum
40,Nice little museum with lots of artefacts from the different empires than have came to Cyprus.Spent an hour walking around which was more than enough time.I enjoyed it.,Cyprus Museum
30,"Some lovely pieces and, for the most part, nicely displayed. Explanations are written in English as well although they are overly technical and confusing (this was a common theme at all the sites I visited in the country) Another issue I had with this particular museum was that they chose to separate the objects by type (ceramic, figures, sculpture) rather than historical time period which was not necessary for such a small museum and took away from the historical narrative in my opinion.",Cyprus Museum
50,We were lucky to join a guided tour of this national museum and had a very interning review of the history of the entire island . The Cypriot terra-cotta figures were quite interesting along with the Greek and Byzantine history artifacts! If possible it is better to visit it before visiting the archaeological museum at Paphos.,Cyprus Museum
50,The museum has several sooms and there has some very interesting objects. It is worth to visit if you want a little bit know the history of Cyprus and see also some figures including the Goddess of the beauty and love - Aphrodite. Nice place to visit with friends or family members.,Cyprus Museum
50,It is an excellent museum with very good presentation and exhibition. I strongly recommend it to visitors.,Cyprus Museum
40,"At the Cyprus Museum, NicosiaThere are ancient artifacts here.With many unique kindsOf object, archaeology finds.It’s all very well displayed(Access is limited for wheelchairs)A fine museum has been madeWith a fair number of stairs.If you can manage some (and I can)It’s worth the effort to seeCyprus’s finest museumWhich for me was quite free.",Cyprus Museum
40,"This is a grand, old fashion museum with lots and lots of interesting objects and information that might overwhelm you....It also hosts temporary exhibitions....it's a must go...",Cyprus Museum
40,Allow a couple of hours to explore artefacts from Cyprus' rich and very long history. Look for the pyrometallurgy display and what I will call the Cypriot terracotta warriors.(Some of the labels could have been clearer and closer to the artefacts.),Cyprus Museum
40,This is a well presented and well lit museum of the history of Cyprus with some audio presentations.,Cyprus Museum
50,"The Cyprus Museum has best collection of ancient artifacts we have seen, and we are museum aficionados. The quality and condition of items 3000+ years old was amazing and it would be easy to spend an entire afternoon in awe. For history buffs as well as those with casual interest in history, the Cyprus Museum is a must-do if you are in Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Cyprus has been inhabited for thousands of years and is a cross roads of different cultures, societies, and civilizations. This museum has amazing artifacts of this experience offering well preserved sculpture and jewelry thousands of years old. Of course many of the exhibits look their age but are still informative and inspiring. Plan on spending 90 minutes to two hours to see it all.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This museum is fascinating in every aspect; the building architecture, the interior design and ease of movement inside the wide corridors, the layout and lighting are perfectly done.The display of these great and well conserved ancient Greek Treasures is so neat and organized; the Museum encompasses a huge and beautiful collection of Pottery, Sculptures, Miniatures, Jewelry, Precious Stones, Coins, Tombs and Tombstones, Columns, and many other artifacts found in Archeological sites around Cyprus. each display had a clear and detailed description in English and Greek Languages.If you need to admire every item displayed you will need a full day; a two hours visit may allow you to quickly walk through the many pavilions of this breathtaking Museum.The entry fee is just 2 Euros; very negligible compared to the treasures you can go through.",Cyprus Museum
40,An hour of quiet to be amazed at the skills and imagination of Cyprus' earliest inhabitants. The painted pottery and the small clay votive figures are entertaining. You can have a drink in the garden outside which is a peaceful place. Five minutes walk from Solomou bus station.,Cyprus Museum
40,"Especially the ceramics has a lot of character. Collections are varied and gives a broad introduction the the findings on the island. The museum is fair in size. In some rooms its modernly in its will to communicate, in others its rather oldfashioned.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Along the Aphrodite route, take time to stop at this museum with relics dating backl to prehistoric times. The treasures unearthed in recent excavations are on display here.",Cyprus Museum
50,Located in the center of Nicosia.The museum houses historic treasures found during numerous excavations on the island.,Cyprus Museum
40,Handsome building all on one floor. Beautifully displayed objects. Good labels and one very informative video. Highly recommended. Few visitors in February.,Cyprus Museum
50,"We had the greatest day here, only meant to spend and hour or so but ended up her the whole day! What a day!",Cyprus Museum
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our tour. The guide was very knowledgeable and the exhibits superb. A fascinating wide ranging museum with many unique artifacts. Eye opening.,Cyprus Museum
40,This is an amazingly complete collection of Cyprus archeological treasures. For such an important museum it is in a rather off the beaten track location. They will call a taxi for you however and it is worth the effort.,Cyprus Museum
40,"Cyprus museum is a very good place to learn the ancient history of Cyprus. It holds a lot of magnificent sculptures showing how was the living and the art in the ancient times,",Cyprus Museum
40,"A lot of items, clean and analytical.Well worth a visit and very educational.Strongly recommended to everyone.",Cyprus Museum
40,"Although unsuitable place for such a precious museum, it is quite well organized offering guided tours with experienced licensed tourist quides. You may find the islands ancient history there since 1600b.c. and earlier! A must for a visitor in town.",Cyprus Museum
50,"yes, this is something I could read about in my class-books long time ago. and I was always wondering are those stories true, or just legends. it is great that you can really touch part of the history.... organisation of the museum must be better, this is only my complain",Cyprus Museum
50,A very good place to visit--you can view the history of Cyprus through ages-From 2000bc until nowdays,Cyprus Museum
40,"Very historical, if looking for more information and history on the area, must visit here! Very interesting.",Cyprus Museum
50,even the musem is small it is very interesting because the exibits date from the neolithic period 7000bc until roman times all from cyprus,Cyprus Museum
40,"A must for anyone interested in the ancient history, history of Cyprus or history of art. The museum is not very modern, yet the information provided and the objects exhibited will certainly attract your attention.",Cyprus Museum
30,"This has a good collection of artefacts, as you would expect from the main museum in a country's capital city. The mix of peoples who have lived on Cyprus and visited it and attacked it and settled it is fascinating and there is excellent archaeological evidence of their influences. The pottery is fascinating, and some of the gold jewellery, not to mention the astonishing find that comprises terracotta figures buried in a remarkable hoard. But I did feel that the whole museum needs some TLC. The display cabinets look dusty and uncared for, especially the glass above them under the lights: would it really take so much time to go through these systematically, open them up, clean the glass, and generally give the idea that there are people who want to show their museum in the best possible light? When we left the museum, there were about half a dozen employees standing around chatting; a firm hand on behalf of the management and a concerted will to do something could result in a much better visitor experience. After all, it is not a free museum!",Cyprus Museum
40,"This is a nice museum with the artifacts from the island, focused on pre-historic, ancient Greek and Roman times (until Byzantine times). The museum is likely to be more interesting for history buffs, as it's done very traditionally (not interactive).We recommend you plan your visit to the times when there's a free guided tour (Tuesdays and Fridays at 10am and 12pm, and Wednesdays at 4pm) organized by Cyprus Tourism Organisation, as that gives you better understanding of the significance of the collection and make the visit more interesting.",Cyprus Museum
40,"If you are interested in historical artifacts including clay pots, figurines and jewelry this is an interesting place to visit.",Cyprus Museum
20,They have some interesting artefacts but I would not call this a must see. It took me an hour to see it all.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Don't miss this, when you visit Nicosia,Museum is near to the bus station.Perfect place to meet culture of cyprus",Cyprus Museum
50,I was gladly surprised ot find such a nice collection of artifacts nicely kept and offering a beautiful glimpse into the island's various historical phases,Cyprus Museum
40,Very nice museum!!! You can discover Cyprus history from prehistoric years!!! My children love it!!! It deserve a visit.... Also it has a very nice shop!!!,Cyprus Museum
50,The history of Cyprus is presented hereThis is a must visit for locals or visitors to learn about the history and development of the island,Cyprus Museum
40,The entrance is quite cheap and you have the chance to learn a few new things about Cyprus and it's history.,Cyprus Museum
50,"I walked up from Ledra St, approx 10mins. Nicely set out museum and worth a second trip. Coffee bar outside in the garden.",Cyprus Museum
30,It's mostly an archeological museum. Displays thousands of artifacts but I think it's state owned so budget limitation applies... It definitely deserves an uplift. Otherwise a great history lesson of the early times of Cyprus.,Cyprus Museum
50,"The view from the top floor is literally amazing! You can see the whole of Nicosia, i loved it so much! definitely going back soon!",Cyprus Museum
20,"If you love archeology then I'm sure you will find this collection interesting. It took me 30 mins to walk round it. The coin collection and some of the tomb collections are interesting. However, if you are pressed for time I'd recommend the Leventis Museum instead.",Cyprus Museum
40,Its fairly small and easy to tour so if you are a tourist visiting nicosia its worth popping in as it gives you a general overview of the islands LONG history with really good and representative exhibits. Its a great pitty that this place has not been refubrished for many years now and this does no favour at all to the many valuable exhibits (Very poor display and lighting conditions). However thats the only option one has today so a visit is def recommended.,Cyprus Museum
50,this is probably a must for every visitor to the island - you'll never be able to understand what it means to be in Cyprus unless you visit the Museum: all the intricacies of the past that affect the present are there. Bonus: the Museum is located very centrally and you can walk to most major attractions from there.,Cyprus Museum
40,"If you intersted in Cyprus's history, this the place to go to.I have seen prehistoric statues, and ancient Greek time related statues.The medieval era under Byzantine ruling is obvious with icons, archeological findings . . .If you want to know about the history of the island, this is the place to visit.",Cyprus Museum
40,"Mostly ancient greek and roman items, byzant and newer times there too. I am so used to these exibits as a local person, that I am not impressed, but I am sure tourist will be.",Cyprus Museum
50,This was an interesting museum for those who love antiquities. It was well laid out and the labels were also in english.,Cyprus Museum
40,"This is a museum for people who like history and pottery. If neither of those things interest you, then it's still really cheap and worth taking a look around. The entire building is dedicated to archeological findings from Cyprus. Though many of the exhibits don't offer much in the way of stories/explanations, those that do are worth taking your time reading. I particularly enjoyed the ""funery epigrams"" - translations of messages on grave markers thousands of years ago.",Cyprus Museum
40,14 rooms of the Cyprus history in which one can see how things evolved on the Island and the impact it had on it's life.,Cyprus Museum
30,"A couple of blocks away from the old city of Nicosia, a museum rich by its content. But unfortunately items are just displayed, with little explanations and no story line to walk through. Unless you really do your homework before, I do not think that a non specialist will enjoy going there neither grasp the rich history of Cyprus",Cyprus Museum
40,"Small, but gives very good information on the history of the island. The artifacts are unique from other museums in the world. Would recommend.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Fantastic collection that leads you through the history of Cyprus. Lots of early potters, artefacts and figurines from 3000bc to Roman statues. Gold and silver jewellery and coins. Each time I visit, I learn more about the fascinating history of Cyprus",Cyprus Museum
50,"I am not a big history buff, but after a pleasant walk around Nicosia we felt we should pop in and take a look - I think it was Euro 4.50 each to get in.You could spend a day there or an hour - (we felt a couple of hours was enough)You really get a sense of the history of the island that perhaps you don't simply driving around.Some incredible history dating back 4/5 thousand years which is brought up to date with the latest archaeological digs on the island.A lovely Museum and well worth popping in to see.",Cyprus Museum
50,A good sized museum with history dating back thousands of years. Just outside the old city walls and not far from the pedestrian area of shops and restaurants.,Cyprus Museum
50,"The museum contains an extensive collection of pottery, statues, coins and jewellery. It isn't very large, and a two hour visit is enough. This makes it ideal for escaping the mid-day heat. The nearby cantina is a nice shaded place to have a drink and a snack. If you are interested in (ancient) history, this is definitely a place you should visit.",Cyprus Museum
50,"I was not exactly sure where this was, I thought it was nearere the centre but it is ever so slightly out of the way, but still very central, perhaps not the best signs if you have parked centrally but we managed to find it on a baking hot day.It is true that it does not look like much from the outside but once inside the rooms go on and on and there is currently an extra exhibit I think.If you do not like history or pottery then in fairness this is not going to be your thing, but for 4.5 Euro an adult I think it is a fair price to keep the place going and to introduce new exhibits.The whole time lines are covered from the earliest inhabitants of the Island the the Roman time and beyond.There are some really interesting exhibits although as some have said in other reviews, they could do perhaps, with some more details and some whilst impressive do not say what they are and it really is not that obvious!It was worth the trip and a few hours spent at a slow pace walking about and having a good look around, there is a small gift shop and just before the museum is a small cafe type shop so stop off for drinks on the way in! The museum is thankfully air conditioned as well which was a pleasant surprise.Well worth the entrance fee I would say.",Cyprus Museum
50,A visit of Nicosia without visiting the Archeological Museum is not complete. Well presented. Travel to the history of Cyprys from the neolithic to the byzantine period.,Cyprus Museum
40,My family is originally from Cyprus so it was great to go and see stuff I remember from my grandparents house!,Cyprus Museum
30,A quite small in size arcaeological museum few minutes away from the historical Centre. Very important items exposed from the old stone era showing the long history of the island trhough centuries. A very popular visit place for people visiting the Capital of the island.,Cyprus Museum
50,Don't leave Nicosia without visiting this museum. The Cyprus Museum offers to the visitor an excellent view to the history of the island of Cyprus. Spacious with good air conditioning makes the visit pleasant. The personnel is friendly.,Cyprus Museum
50,"All history of Cyprus is here, you must Visit if you are in Capital City. Here you can see how Rich is our History!!",Cyprus Museum
50,For those who love history and who want broaden up their horizons. It's a really really nice museum! We spent three hours there and it was not enough!,Cyprus Museum
50,"One cannot leave Cyprus without visiting this museum, which explains and shows the history of this island which is Greek but never belonged to Greece.",Cyprus Museum
50,The Cyprus Museum offers to the visitor a long trip to the history of the island of Cyprus. Spacious and visitor friendly could easily become the highlight of your visit in Nicosia. The personnel is friendly and readily available to provide valuable information.,Cyprus Museum
50,It's a good way to expend some of the hours while the sun is strong.It has 3 levels and you can see how history of nicosia has been going for the las 5000 years.,Cyprus Museum
40,Is worthwhile to visit. There you can see how people used to leave more than two thousand years ago and several types of things that they use.,Cyprus Museum
10,Too boring for an outsider.More description of artifacts would have added value. Or a handbook / audio-guide can be provided.,Cyprus Museum
50,"the history of Cyprus is long and rich, and even though this museum is old and with tired displays the exhibits are just Amazing!!The museum grounds are not that big but the museum is filled with amazing finds from the stone age and so forth.Worth the visit!! Don't miss it if you are visiting Cyprus!!",Cyprus Museum
50,It is s must see . i think one of the best museums.They have guide there to go through the displays and it was really informative .,Cyprus Museum
50,It was very interesting to see things I only red about. For everything there was description and also you can make pictures. My son loved the museum and specialy the arrow collection.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Great place to go to relive a part of history. Exhibits well set out with lots to see.located in an easy to get to place, if you get lost ask a local or passer by who all seem friendly enough...",Cyprus Museum
40,"Definitely worth a visit, but a guided tour is preferable, as the amazing - if traditionally displayed - collections, dating back to the Neolithic through the Roman time, would require a lot of reading to be fully appreciated.",Cyprus Museum
30,"The first time I visited the Cyprus Museum was back in 1967. Nothing much changed since then. It contains some excellent pieces of arts from Cyprus's ancient history but the way they are displayed is very boring. Not user friendly at all. Not a surprise that only a tiny portion of the tourists that come to Cyprus visit it. Cypriots rarely set a foot in it. A visit to the British Museum and/or the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, by the people in charge will give them some ideas as to how to display items.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Very good museum. It helps you to understand through the art how different civilizations from Mediterranean part and Orient influenced the cypriot culture. Plus, if you have visited Khirokitia and Pafos ruins you will see in the museum lot of ancient ceramics, art or utensils.",Cyprus Museum
50,Amazing artefacts which attest to Cyprus' rich history on the crossroads of great civilizations. I especially liked the exhibits which show how Cyprus was influenced both by eastern and western ancient peoples.,Cyprus Museum
40,Cyprus museum is the archeological museum in the centre of Nicosia. It is not a big museum. But the exhibits cover history from Neolithic period. It is worth visiting for sure but I would prefer a guided tour.,Cyprus Museum
40,The museum offers an opportunity to learn about the amazing history of Cyprus in a series of well laid out and compact displays. Well worth a visit.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Millions of people go to Cyprus every year.Very few visit the Cyprus museum.VERY unwise.It is a little treasure trove,packed with artefacts, well arranged.I cannot recommend it strongly enough.Please visit it.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This is a relatively small but very good museum. It is well laid out and has just the right amount of information about the exhibits. The exhibits themselves are stunning. Obviously there is a lot of stuff there from the classical era but the have a good selection of objects going all the way back to the earliest settlements on Cyprus. It might sound silly but the thing that caught me off guard was the 3000 year old bed that looks like you could still just put a mattress on it and just go to sleep!Just so you know, this museum is pretty serious, it's not exactly child friendly. Don't go expecting lots of interactive stuff for the kids to do, they (rightly in my eyes as a national museum in a country with a huge amount of important history) have kept it basic, with the objects and the history as the important thing.All in all, it's worth hunting this place out and and it is more than worth the entrance fee.",Cyprus Museum
40,"We went with our children (<5 years old) and had a very good time showing them around a bit of our history! Even though the museum is relatively small, it is comprehensive since it has artifacts from every important period Cyprus went through. The entrance fee is really low! However, there could be a children's corner with some museum toys for real interaction!",Cyprus Museum
50,"A moderate sized museum with big historical artifacts. Dating from stonage to roman time very beautiful jewelry, statues, pots and artifacts. Also a small reconstructed tombe inside the museum from emperor severus. A must see for people looking for the artifacts from the digging sites! Entree €4,50 P.P.",Cyprus Museum
40,All of the historical information was well presented.It's amazing how much has been preserved.It has stunning pieces found in Cyprus area on display.Very large exhibition in a great setting.You can learn a lot about the history of Cyprus,Cyprus Museum
40,"Found this place with a help of Google Maps. Didn´t have any expectations and thought I find Greek type vases and sculptures there. But I was wrong - I have never seen such an interesting exposition like the ancient Cyprian artefacts. Unique statues, decorative pottery, amazing details - simply fantastic! And yes, there were Greek type vases from later historical periods and much-much more, but for me the rooms with ancient art were the most interesting. And I really was interested.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Situated outside the city wall, the museum itself is a historical building. It should be a heaven for archaeological fan. If you agree with the belief of 'ancient aliens', you should spend some time in the museum if you are in Cyprus. The museum is not big in size but got great and unique collections. You won't be disappointed. Most of the famous or important artifacts found on the island are displayed here but not the district archaeological museums. Apart from crossing the border, this is another 'must-do' in this divided city.",Cyprus Museum
50,"although this museum is a cozy place more like an old house but you can find many interesting objects there as a signe of a historical place from coins to big sculptures! as i always belive a traveller should not miss any piece of any place because we may not return there again , so dont miss this place even if its far from beach and city center, you can use one day trips and tours to make it economical!!!",Cyprus Museum
50,"Amazing museum with so many artifacts. Very much helped figure out the history of the island. Of course, this was to a great extent thanks to the free tour we joined (2 tours: 10 am and 12 pm). The very informative guide was answering all our questions and covering even story from mythology in great detail. Very impressed with this museum and pleased we visited it. There's a free communal parking close to the museum, it's next to the hospital.",Cyprus Museum
50,"The Cyprus Museum houses a fabulous collection of treasures of the island's rich archaeological past. The beginning three galleries provide a chronological overview of the island through the rich pottery finds on the island. Not to be missed in the first room is the wall painting of a red ochre man from the Neolithic site of Kalavassos-Tenta. Also in Room one is the Chalcolithic house model from Kissonerga-Mosphilia which was found by Dr Peltenberg and his team, which was filled with terracotta figurines and stone tools as a ritual deposit. The modle is displayed with the full assemblage of artefacts including the female TC depicting a woman in the act of giving birth. In the second room we see another model, this time dating to the end of the Early Bronze Age from Vounous Tomb 22 depicting a sanctuary. Inside the enclosure wall we see animals coraled in pens and people standing around or sitting on benches near scultures attached to the far wall from the door. Note the curious figure looking over the wall trying to see the action!The third room has pottery dating from the Late Bronze Age through the Roman period. Room four house a small part of the amazing assemblage for votive offerings in the form of terracotta figurines from the sanctuary of Ayia Irini which was excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition. They were found in situ arranged around the altar as they must have been placed by the ancient worshippers giving us an unusual glimpse into the workings of an ancient cult.The rest of the museum has sculpture from all periods (including an unusual nude bronze sculpture of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus), tomb mock ups, inscriptions, jewellery and the magnificent finds from the Archaic Royal Tombs at Salamis.Overall it is a collection which is small but choice and well worth making the trip up to Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
50,A small museum but containing a rich and varied collection of archaeological artefacts. well presented and lit displays allowing good viewing . well worth a visit and entry price is modest. Cyprus should concentrate on developing its cultural and historical l tourism and forget the destructive mass market tourism,Cyprus Museum
50,"My wife and I visited this museum while on a day trip to Nicosia from Larnaca, and the museum alone was worth the trip. The collection is presented pretty much in chronological order with all the information in English you could want. The vast wealth of items, all from Cyprus, is quite impressive. The items on display do not go past the early Byzantine era for the most part, but there is plenty enough to see to easily spend a couple hours here. And it is only 4.50 euros to get in. I definitely recommend stopping here if you are in Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
50,"They have many sculptures - and i was not so surprised as Cyprus is so ancient country. Anyway, the museum is well structured and there are tags in English language everywhere. After visiting many museums in Greek, i appreciate Cyprus even more!",Cyprus Museum
50,"Although we did head here to escape a huge downpour, I'm so glad we did! An amazing journey through Cyprus history from the Neolithic finds of Chorokitia to more modern day finds. Gorgeous pieces and a great layout made for an excellent couple of hours visit.",Cyprus Museum
40,"If you are visiting Cyprus, I would recommend staying in Nicosia for a day in order to explore the old city and visit one or two museums to learn about the history of the country.The museum shows a rich collection of interesting artefacts, but it lacks organisation and presentation. Still, the best option is to visit with a licenced guide who will help you understand what you see, connect each item to the next and make you feel enhusiastic about learning these things.Opening times are a bit limited, but if you are on a holiday on a working day of the week it shouldnt be a problem.",Cyprus Museum
50,"For first time visitors to Cyprus this is an excellent starting point to learn about its history which goes back thousands of years. It can guide one to visit individual places of interest spread across the country. Although I have visited many places of interest in Cyprus over the years, I should have made this Museum my starting point.",Cyprus Museum
50,Very interesting historical items to see which reflect the history of Cyprus for more than 2000 years,Cyprus Museum
50,"This museum was quite difficult to find but well worth the time. The artifacts cover thousands of years and the quality, scope and sheer beauty needs to be seen. The exhibits are all described in both Greek and English. One exhibit was part of a chase across museums to bring back a small but intricate piece of art which is amazing. Other items, such as the treasure trove and the lion statuary look as if they were only made yesterday. If you have any interest in either history or archaeology go see this place. Well worth your time.",Cyprus Museum
40,Interesting exhibits about ancient Cypriote history. Difinitely worth a look if you're into ancient Greek(ish) history!,Cyprus Museum
50,"Thre is more stuff in the museum, that you might expect from the outside of the building. Take enough time to look at this.",Cyprus Museum
30,"it was interesting to visit, but I'd say the free museum in the town centre was more interesting than this one",Cyprus Museum
50,"The museum's collections are abundant and all the artefacts are in good condition. The only thing museum lacks is either an audio guide or some interaction to involve the visitors because although the museum is fantastic, it does require a lot of time and attention to study the collections. Give it a chance, you won't regret it!",Cyprus Museum
40,"Don't make the mistake of not visiting this museum if in Nicosia. It is less than a five minute walk from Solomou Square in Old Town. This was an excellent way to learn about the rich history of the island.Unfortunately, the museum is in dire need of renovation and the display is really quite poor. Many of the pieces are displayed in corners with poor lighting and with plaques that haven't been updated for decades. Made me question whether the information displayed is accurate. It's really a shame.",Cyprus Museum
50,An excellent museum with artefacts going back to 4000 BC.It really is worth a visit to get a snapshot of the history of Cyprus. And it really does have some history.We were lucky enough to tag along with a tour guide which we would recommend to all as the information adds such a lot to the visit.,Cyprus Museum
50,"As with all museum visits, I recommend visitors to go for the guided tour (there are two English guided tours daily). I went for the later and last session of the day which started at 11.45am and ended at around 1pm.The guide was very knowledgeable and gave a good introduction of Cyprus on a chronological basis, from the early settlers to the influences from the surrounding countries and past empires.My partner and I learned a lot from this tour and museum visit - best EUR4.50 spent!",Cyprus Museum
50,"I really enjoyed this museum, especially the room with the ancient figurines. Some are more on the adult side, so be fore warned :-) This was worth the drive to Nicosia for me.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Whether you have a great interest in archaeology or not this museum is a ""must see"" on your visit to the historic city of Nicosia/Lefkosia.A journey through time and history from the earliest inhabitants of the island through the many that followed as the country came under the influence of so many different cultures.A small museum, and certainly not comparable with much larger and more famous homes of history, but it offers a wonderful insight into the past of a fascinating island which was coveted and conquered and influenced by so many different civilisations.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This museum contains pieces from all periods of cypriotic history, some of them very unique and quaint, in my opinion not to be seen somewhere else. Very well arranged and displayed exposition, good explanations for the artefacts. Museum is not very large and can be viewed in its entirety in some 2 hours. There is a kiosk in the museum garden, where is possible to sit down in the shadow and get some refreshments and something to eat.Opening hours are tue-fri 8-18, sat 9-17, sun. 10-13, mon. is closed, ticket costs 4,50 E/adult.",Cyprus Museum
50,Great exhibits in a small but interesting museum. nice way to spend an afternoon. inexpensive afternoon,Cyprus Museum
40,"It is difficult to believe that items 4000 years old can be preserved in such good condition. Cyprus has a long complicated history. Exhibits here from throughout the centuries give us a chance to understand it better. Pottery, bronzes, coins jewellery, and sculpture are all represented. Well worth a visit but a pity their leaflet could not resist making unfavourable reference to the Turkish North where there is much preservation to be seen.",Cyprus Museum
50,"Extraordinary pottery (design and decoration, and I'm not really interested in pottery), some beautiful artefacts e.g. the cylinder seals and the amazing 2 millennium old bed. Some moving sculptures - crosses and winged-angels pre-Christianity, Alexander the Great, classical Greek. Punched well above my expectations going in.",Cyprus Museum
50,you will be surprised with the rich history that cyprus has. every room is dedicated to a certain centuary. taking photo is alloweb but WITHOUT FLASH. statues vary from rock to marble to bronze.,Cyprus Museum
50,What an amazing discovery of the life of the island of Cyprus. Well worth the effort and the time to read the history as well as view the amazing ancient artifacts.,Cyprus Museum
40,This is a must for at least once. It needs a lot of work but it has so much richness of the Cypriot history inside!,Cyprus Museum
30,"The 'Body' exhibition, displaying pieces depicting the human body and bodily functions is interesting. The Sculpture Gallery was also interesting. The museum is small enough to cover in an hour or so.",Cyprus Museum
50,Unique experience. We were very glad visiting this museum (incredible representation with 3D if Nicosia through time) and we would love coming again and having more time. It is huge (compared with the quality of the items),Cyprus Museum
50,"This museum gives visitors a good insight into Cyprus history. It has lots of fantastic artefacts, coins, jewellrey and statues. The room settings are very well set out and are easily accessed. Entrance is only 4-50e",Cyprus Museum
50,The museum is in an easy location and very easy to find. The artifacts are in excellent condition well preserved and exhibited . Going through the well aired spacious rooms of the colonial building you feel great satisfaction and awe for the beauty and historical value and toil of all who managed to put all in chronological order and harmonious perfection. I go there quote often and many a time I forget myself there. My suggestion is that people should go there especially on Sundays when it is as I believe free entrance.,Cyprus Museum
50,I enjoyed my time there and saw a lot of ancient collections. it was interesting enough to my teenage kids and to us the adults.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Small but superb examples of prehistoric and early historic artifacts, especially beautiful pottery and statuary. Every power that arose in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean from about 2,000 BC forward left artifacts and footprints on Cyprus - Ancient Persians, Greeks, Romans, Crusaders.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This small but incredible museum lies just outside the city walls on the south side of Nicosia and offers a superbly presented glimpse into the island's ancient past. Give yourself at least an hour to go around, no hardship away from the heat of the sun, and enjoy the wide variety of well presented exhibits. As well as undoubted works of high art, brilliant sculpture and ceramics, there are numerous small and witty delights from the potters of the past and many unexpected treasures",Cyprus Museum
50,"Sure enough you cannot expect this museum to be something like the Met, British Museum, or anything of the kind. But truly, if you're in Cyprus, you have to get some idea about where you are and where these most lovely people come from. And this museum gives the idea. Sculptures, jewelery, pots and other items from the oldest times, reflecting the different influences on the island, from assyrians to the greeks. Most importantly, they have an excellent exposition called ""the body"", explaining many of the local customs, rituals, lifestyles from different times. I spent 2-3 hours here - more than enough - and got a lot of information. Loved it.",Cyprus Museum
50,"We enjoyed the exhibits and the temporary exhibition called ""The body"".We liked the fact that there was life inside the musem, a piano, people preparing for a musical performance. We liked the way the museum was organised.The size of the museum was the right one. It had a great variety of exhibits for the parents to appreciate, but it was not long enough for the kids to get bored.Only drawback that there weren't enough explanatory captions, since we wanted to know more about the exhibits we were looking at.",Cyprus Museum
50,Excellent variety of exhibits with really good explanations in english and greek. Some exceptional items on display and all were found in Cyprus.,Cyprus Museum
40,"We visited here in June and really enjoyed it. The temperature in Nicosia was 46 degrees celsius that day and the museum was blissfully cool!There are lots of artefacts, some many thousands of years old and lots of interesting information on the history of Cyprus. Worth a visit.",Cyprus Museum
50,The museum has renewed its collections and we were lucky to enjoy for Museum day a wonderful guided tour. It is worthwhile visiting to help tourists learn about our ancient history.,Cyprus Museum
40,The Cyprus Museum is well worth a visit if you are in Nicosia. It’s not huge but has a good archaeological selection. The museum itself is a bit dark and perhaps in need of a renovation. We arrived 45 minutes before it closed and managed to see everything we wanted to see in this time. There are plenty of Roman artefacts and we particularly enjoyed the tomb reconstructions.,Cyprus Museum
50,Essentially an archaeology museum it is among the best we've been to. Excellent presentation and unexpected gems in every section. Not to be missed,Cyprus Museum
30,The museum has a lot of wonderful artefacts but they are not all that well displayed. The exception is the special exhibition on the theme of the body which was well put together and very informative. Worth a visit but could definitely be better.,Cyprus Museum
30,"The museum houses amazing treasures but sadly it lacks the accompanying aura so you leave without appreciating them. Let me explain- the building needs serious renovation, the visiting hours are horrible, the staff seem tired and uninterested, and overall the place seems like it is on life support. A shame really because the tour will give one an insight into the very rich and formidable local history. The place needs revamping and most of all some people who care. A nice cafe like all decent museums would also help. As for children, do not even think of taking them here unless you know the history and can tell good and entertaining stories. Otherwise it is very child unfriendly, in fact it is visitor unfriendly period. The captions are ok, in both Greek and English but I think prior knowledge help. If you are in the area it may be worth a visit- as I said the artifacts are incredible- but don't go out of your way to visit. Better to go to Paphos instead.",Cyprus Museum
30,"The sculptures are definitely worth seeing, my favorite part by far. The museum also included pottery, jewelry and smaller archaic statues. They have a nice collection, lots of history.Cons: I came on a Friday morning, there were many school groups there who were hard to maneuver around. There were also weird people doing interpretive dance in various rooms (don’t think they were hired by the museum). I happened into a part where they were doing renovations and the people were none too happy, now that I think about it not very friendly at reception either. The museum is relatively small.Overall, glad I saw it. It was close to my hotel. Would I go again? No. Would I recommend to someone far away? Nope.",Cyprus Museum
50,"The cultural heritage of Cyprus, such as pottery, jewelry, sculpture and coins from the Neolithic period to the Bronze Age, Iron Age and the Greco-Roman period, is cherished and displayed for everyone to enjoy.I never expected it to be of such interest. Nicely presented with notes in both Greek and English. I did not like the idea that cameras are strictly prohibited at first, but by the end of the tour I was assured that this is how it should be.It traces the long history of civilization on the island from prehistoric times to the early Christian period and it is certainly a highly recommended spot to visit.One negative: There should be a ban in smoking. It is annoying seeing staff smoking inside the museum.",Cyprus Museum
20,"Question: why does the grandly-named national Museum of Cyprus close at 4pm? Question: why do the staff jangle keys,turn off lights and turf you out before 4pm-? We visited in desperation on a pouring wet day all the way from Paphos. The attitude and hours are what I expect in the UK- though am sure the British Museum does better hours than this. The museum itself in small but interesting- though we liked the Paphos archaeology museum better plus we had interested enthusiastic staff and better hours there. We struggled to spend any money in Nicosia-basically it closed at 5pm. Derelict shops and businesses, cafes and restaurants closed: cold and unwelcoming.Not sure how Cyprus will engineer a recovery based on our experience.",Cyprus Museum
40,"I found this museum very interesting. I'm not usually one for antique pottery, but the artifacts here are beautiful and so well displayed that I loved them. I also learnt a lot about the history of the island",Cyprus Museum
50,"Excellent, thorough, magnificent capsule of Cyprus' long and re-discovered history. What I disliked is that the guards in the rooms smoked with impunity, and the tour guides were very loud. Both these intrusions somewhat spoiled my experience. I think the management could repair these problems easily. Ban smoking for the STAFF too. How hard is that?",Cyprus Museum
40,"In reading a review by Cybelle, amsterdam, may I correct our friend that there is no such thing as border, neither ""Northern Cyprus"", but a part of the Republic of Cyprus (a full member of the EU) which is under occupation. Some respect towards truth is essential.As far as the Museum is concerned, I never expected it to be so interesting , well presented in greek and english. In general, do not miss it and take the family along.",Cyprus Museum
50,"if you're a history buff, you'll find more artifacts in this museum than you can take in. This museum consists of fourteen rooms, and exhibits follow a chronological order. The oldest artifacts in Room I (tools, stone vessels and figurines) date back to the Neolithic era. Don't miss the marble statue of Aphrodite from Soli, which is the symbol of the island. Other highlights include bronze age pottery, gold jewellery, the lions and sphinxes from Tamassos necropolis, the clay figurines from Agia Irini sanctuary and limestone sarcophagi decorated with carvings. The working hours of this Museum are frankly ridiculous so make sure you get there while it's actually open. (Μοnday: closed, Tuesday, Wednesday & Friday: 08:00 - 16:00, Thursday: 08:00 - 17:00, Saturday: 09:00 - 16:00, Sunday: 10:00 - 13:00)",Cyprus Museum
50,"Truly one of the most interesting museums I've ever visited!! If you like Greek-Roman art this is THE PLACE. When I visited it sadly it wasn't very well kept.. a bit old, quite small for the amount of magnificent things inside and not many visitors. The price was super convenient though (free if you're a student and a few euros for adults). Honestly, I wasn't expecting such a concentration of interesting and beautiful things in such a small and not at all advertised place....!!! If you're in Cyprus you certainly need to go there; if you're not in Cyprus...you might think about booking a flight just to see this amazing Museum!!!!! I really hope this gem will get the renovation, fame and number of visitors it deserves.",Cyprus Museum
50,"It is not as big as the louvre. it is not as famous. But by the standards of the island, it is full of history and culture. Visit it, with your family. You will love it and your kids will learn many things!",Cyprus Museum
50,The Cyprus Museum is another place to learn about the history of the island. You go back in time with findings from the second older city in the world until our present days. Nice for the family too.,Cyprus Museum
50,Cyprus has a long and considerable archeological history. At the museum you can see almost each stage of its development. The museum is the home of the most valuable collection of Cyprus antiques World wide.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Within the Museum one can see and understand how the island developed chronologically, when and who visited it. If you are a keen historian, allow at least sever hours to absorb all that info!",Cyprus Museum
50,Cyprus is the third largest island in the mediterranean sea with thousands of years history. You can easily imagine what sort of antiquities a visitor to the Cyprus Museum can see.The Cyprus Museum is the oldest and largest archeological museum in Cyprus. It was founded in 1882 and houses artefacts discovered during numerous excavations on the island. The museum is home to the most extensive collection of cypriot antiquities in the world.,Cyprus Museum
50,"This museum is just the right size and is nicely laid out with excellent labelling in Greek and English. Unfortunately no one pointed out to us that the museum closes at 4 when we arrived just after 3, and we were really only halfway through our visit when the closing bell sounded. I was very disappointed, as we were only in Nicosia for the day, and the part that I whizzed through would have been well worth a longer visit. There are many outstanding exhibits arranged in ways that enhance your understanding. This really is an exceptionally good archaeology museum with unfortunately curtailed opening hours.",Cyprus Museum
50,A wonderful museum worth crossing the border from Northern Cyprus and the walk to get there. This is not one of those museums one goes to to be pampered and amused; but for those who want to look and marvel at the beauty and craftsmanship of folks long gone it's a treat.,Cyprus Museum
30,"An interesting museum that enables you to follow the history of Cyprus from the early ages until Roman and Byzantium era. The best way to follow the exhbitions is to turn left, as you enter the museum and proceed to the last room and then begin from this room backwards until you find the entrance. In this way you will follow the exhibits in an ascending manner through time. The museum is small and probably 1-2 hours is an appropriate visit duration. We visited te museum on the ""World Tourism Day"" and we had a personal guide, which helped us understand some specific details. Even without a guide, we could follow the exhibitions with ease. We did not pay ticjket, due to the day, but normally it is of low price (around 3 euros).",Cyprus Museum
50,It is so lovely to be able to see exhibits without having to fight past the crowds. A few coach loads of tourists visit but they rapidly pass through leaving you empty rooms to contemplate whichever exhibit you want.,Cyprus Museum
30,Nice building but no parking nearby.Items displayed well but they didn't tell much about anything and the available leaflets were just as bad,Cyprus Museum
50,The museum has some lovely examples of the early Archaic sculpture and even Egyptian influenced pieces of sculpture. I will certainly visit it again next time I go to Cyprus.,Cyprus Museum
50,"Very nice museum , includes a huge collection of pottery, statues, very interesting tomb (and skeleton finds). A must visit",Cyprus Museum
40,I knew of Cyprus's (significant) position in mediterranean archaic history before travelling but had no idea of the length and depth until I visited the museum. Some stunning artifacts well laid-out,Cyprus Museum
50,"There are some truly beautiful things in this small and very cheap(3,5 E) museum.It is open from 8:00 am during weekdays,except Mondays.It is the best thing I saw in Cyprus.",Cyprus Museum
50,"You will be amazed at what you will see in their collections. They even have figures that are reminiscent of China's Terra-cotta Warriors. You can trace Cyprus's turbulent history and its relations with Egypt, India and China.",Cyprus Museum
40,"I often visit the place with my six year old grandson and we always have a great time. The place is small by international standards but extremely rich in exhibits. During our last visit, a section of the museum was closed to the public for renovation but we were amply compensated by visiting thespecial ""Fragments"" exhibition.As far as I am concerned, the highlight of the museum are the numerous clay figurines from Agia Irini whilst my grandson considers the cruciform figurines from the Paphos' region as tops.At rthe end of your visit, make a point of visiting the small kiosk in the museum's garden oasis and have a hot or cool drink.Definitely the museum is worth a visit. We already planned our next visit for the end of August.",Cyprus Museum
40,"The museum is small enough to be reasonably enjoyed on a single visit. The clay figurines and idols from Cyprus' nine millennia of history are fascinating. Here, one can really understand what is unique about Cyprus. Unfortunately, the area surrounding the museum has been a bit run down in recent years following the as-yet-unrepaired collapse of the roof of the former national theater across the street. Nevertheless, the museum still has some of the charm of an older Nicosia.",Cyprus Museum
40,This museum is well worth your time. The reconstruction of the burial sites was very informative - having already visited a number of such sites. Most impressive was the terra-cotta soldiers on chariots forming a terra-cotta army on display. The age and the detail is impressive. Don't miss this museum.,Cyprus Museum
40,Large collection of archaeological finds. Interesting video about the various digs in the early 20th century. See amazing Roman glass and the gold collection. Also a mini terracotta army. Need to be into history and archaeology! Good value at 3 euro entry fee.,Cyprus Museum
40,"Cyprus history goes ages back and many conqueros passed from the Island leaving their own significant arts and their own way of living.Although the Museum is small, you will see excellent exhibitions of great historical meaning and value.It was great experience for me and i really advise you not to miss it.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This is the place to get familiar with the history of the island!!! amazing statues, very well preserved.",Cyprus Museum
50,"This is a small museum but with exhibits of excellent quality. I am interested in Roman and pre-Roman archaeology and have visited exhibits of this type in the British Museum, the Louvre and the Metropolitan in New York. The Roman Glass exhibited here is right up there with the best. Greek red and black ground vases are top quality as is the pre-historic pottery. Treat yourself to the best with a visit!",Cyprus Museum
40,"I visited Cyprus in late October with some friends, and we went to this museum. It was on the small side - actually, the very small side if you are used to museums in large cities like NY or Boston, but it was full of history and atrifacts - pottery, clothing, etc. It was inexpensive, and I thought that it was very well done. I enjoyed my short time there.",Cyprus Museum
40,This is the biggest museum in Cyprus and has more than ten rooms that the one follows the other chronologically and thematically.They start from neolthic period to the hellenistic and roman period.They have also a vast collection of pottery from the Bronze Age and some archaic statues.It is very interesting to visit it...,Cyprus Museum
40,We visitted the museum as part of our trip to Nicosia and enjoyed seeing all the old and new artifacts and clothing.Some fantastic paintings and great memories,Cyprus Museum
50,"A gem, packed with history. It is not the biggest museum in the world in matter of square meters, yet is one of the biggest museums in the world in matter of treasures dating since the beginning of times. If you are a history lover, you can easily spend a whole day walking its halls, taking an overwhelmed journey to history.",Cyprus Museum
40,"Not the biggest museum in the world but it beautifully captures the ancient history of this wonderful island. Some of the pottery figures which are 3000 years old look as if they could have been used as inspiration for Pixar and the like so quirky looking are they. Two more big plusses, its cheap ie less than a fiver and on a day when it passed 40 degrees in Nicosia its well air conditioned. If you like a bit of history then this ones for you.",Cyprus Museum
50,Very beautiful and well worth the trip. We were moved by the history and beauty of this museum,Cyprus Museum
20,"Cyprus has a lot of history and a lot of culture. That is experience mostly through talking to local people, driving around, visiting the old city and reading about it. The museums are small and boring compared to everything else there is to see!",Cyprus Museum
50,"Do not miss this excellent and very rich museum. In addition to other great pieces of art, it has fantastic and rather unusual terracottas belonging to centuries and millennia before Christ.",Cyprus Museum
40,It was an interesting visit that one should make once in Cyprus. The only negative is that you get a sad feeling that the museum is neglected.,Cyprus Museum
40,"The collection here is unbelievable. It needs to be a bit better labeled, as I often was curious about an individual piece and couldn't find any information...",Cyprus Museum
50,It was surprised at how much history was packed into a relatively small museum. The entire collection is in a few rooms but there is so much to see and appreciate. Many of the statues are out in the open. Explantions tend to be brief and the information signs need are fading but you can get a good idea of the history of each item,Cyprus Museum
40,A bit tired and dusty but well worth a visit. This island has an amzing history - and prehistory,Cyprus Museum
50,"nice museum, not overloaded, perfect overview of the history of cyprus in 14 rooms",Cyprus Museum
30,"Very interesting museum, but it seems that no one takes care of it since the british left the country. Tip: if you are planning to visit the other museums and archaeological sites in Cyprus (south side only), there is a €17 pass that will fit you.",Cyprus Museum
50,"I went with a friend, and we both loved the Museum, though its display is a little more traditional, and a bit boring, than most museums we visited in Cyprus (such as the Leventis), and we visited almost every museum possible! But beautiful objects, and well displayed.",Cyprus Museum
30,A huge collection of excellent artefacts from all over Cyprus including all of the most important sites in the north. Many items are poorly labelled. Photography is not permitted.,Cyprus Museum
30,"The museum looks like nothing has been done to it since 20 years now. Everything looks old (I dont mean the antiquities) and there is no information on the displays. Some objects have small discriptions with the date and the place it was found - but nothing on it - how it was used, why it was made, its purpose, etc. At the end we felt it was boring, since you just walk around looking at a lot of different objects without knowing what they are. The people in charge there need to do something to catch up with other modern day museums - there are so many antiquities in Cyprus that people should see and know about - DO SOMETHING!!!",Cyprus Museum
50,If you want to find out more about the fascinating history of Cyprus this is a must for your itinerary,Cyprus Museum
40,"I visited the Cyprus Museum in April 2010. It is organised mainly in rooms in historical sequence from Neolithic times. It was mainly well organised, but I found the display on agriculture disappointing and strangely displayed next to the metallurgy section.The artefacts on the display are fascinating and although many are from heritage shared with other cultures (such as Graeco-Romano, Venetian and Ottoman periods) there are also many fascinating artefacts unique to Cyprus. The terracotta pieces in particular fascinated me: these included life-size figures as well as small bowl-shaped arrangements containing figurines and depictions of scenes.Tour groups whiz round in about half an hour, but I think you need at least 1.5 hours to appreciate this interesting museum.There are good toilet facilities, a nice garden and cafe outside.",Cyprus Museum
