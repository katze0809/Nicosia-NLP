This was a terrific visit",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

There is a great amount of information here, with interactive and educational areas for children. There is English labelling too.

40,"We visited this museum while in Nicosia. It is well laid out, informative, and best of all free. Definitely a must see while in Nicosia",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"This is a fantastic little museum, hidden away in a corner of the old town. It outlines the history of Cyprus and its conflicts, and has lots of interesting artefacts and exhibits. Our children loved the interactive maps and the children's area with colouring activities and dressing up clothes. Admission is free but there is a donation jar by the door. Highly recommended!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"One hour in the Leventis Museum is the perfect introduction to the old city as you start your walking tour. I had no idea the many layers of history and empire in Cyprus, including a British royal wedding 1,000 years ago. Good use of technology, household items, music, and a scavenger hunt for kids.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"Nice museum with a lot exhibits to see, you gonna need aproximately 1 1/2 - 2 hrs to the museum. I think on Mondays is closed",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,This museum - located in the old part of Nicosia - is a great way to learn about the history of Nicosia itself - going back thousands of years to more recent times. The museum has an excellent collection which is enhanced by well produced interactives and virtual tours. Best of all it is free. A must see.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"Careful design and excellent interpretation make the 9000 years of human occupation of Cyprus come alive. There are also several personal collections lent to this museum. We spent at least a couple of hours here. Shop has a great book collection as well. It's free but you should leave a donation, it's really good. The Old City is small so it's easy to get to this museum on foot from anywhere inside the walls.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"I was on a somewhat disappointing tour of Nicosia when our guide recommended this little museum in a side street on the Greek side and it made the day! It's small for a city museum and apparently most of the exhibits come from private Cypriot collections. This means that the exhibits aren't grand or even particularly valuable but that makes them the more charming. The relatively large collection of ceramics are incredibly lovely - bowls and dishes from the 14th and 15thC which look as fresh and modern as if they'd been made in the last twenty years. There are little domestic items which reflect the island's history of occupation by various empires, from the British back to 5000AD. Some, like the 15thC Venetian silver spoon - would be lost in larger collections and are given their full value here.It's a lovely way to spend an hour or more and in a pleasant area with charming cafes. If it weren't for the unsmiling and suspicious-looking staff, it would be perfect.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,Perfect for if you want a quick visit with many interesting things to see. We spent about 45 mins here but could’ve easily spent a bit longer if we didn’t have a little one in tow. She was happily looking at things with us too so didn’t get bored. Lovely building and interesting exhibits.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,I walked past this building several times in the past 24 hours without realising what it was. Shutters all closed and looks to be a private house until you push open the door. Interesting museum and a welcome escape from the tourist area of Ledra Street. Free entrance but deserted when I visited. Closed on Mondays.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"Most of us don’t know much Cypriot history. This is a good overview with some very nice exhibits of Cypriot customs, jewelry and crafts as well. I’m not s shopper myself but there was a nice gift shop with a good variety of books and gifts.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,Very interesting museum and should you stare around you may feel that you are time travelling. Recommended.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,This was our favourite museum in Nicosia as it had a more modern feel to it. Something for everyone with plenty of displays and sufficient information. Entry is free and the air conditioning was lovely and cool.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"While the Cyprus Museum may have a better collection of ancient artifacts, this museum is excellent at putting things into historical context with just enough artifacts to illustrate the story. While the focus is on Nicosia, much of the entire island history is covered.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,A very well laid out museum with interesting exhibits about the history of Nicosia. Well worth a visit.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"We went at the Leventis the first morning we were in Nicosia. This was a really great way of discovering the history of the city and area of Nicosia. This allowed us, the following days, to discover the city with another look. The museum, free (!), is well designed and organized in different sections, chronologically. It's modern and pleasant.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

50,"There is no entrance fee, but a collection box is unobtrusively placed in the entrance area. On the morning of my visit, I think I was the only person there, apart from the staff. There are 3 floors charting Nicosia's history from ancient times to the period of British colony with information boards and many interesting exhibits, labelled in Greek and English. The museum also houses the collection of Nico Leventis.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

50,"The Cyprus Museum is great for prehistoric and ancient times, this one focuses more on Nicosia itself from the Middle Ages to British colonial times. The exhibition is definitely worth visiting.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

Thus place takes you on a wonderful journey every now and then people from yesteryear pop up like Kirchener and Her Majesty the Queen. But the journey starts way back in history . Well worth checking it out .,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
30,This Museum is located in the middle of Nicosia Business district which is walking distance to the historical neigborhood.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"Located 'within the Walls' in the heart of Old Lefkosia (Nicosia) in a brilliantly renovated mansion which is by itself a place of architectural and artistic interest. My first choice for a 'culture tour' whenever friends from abroad visit; even for me - a native of Cyprus - It is never tiring revisiting the place. The museum offers a timeline of the history of this ancient island with selected timepieces and focusing (seems to me) on Frankish/Venetian and Ottoman Empire eras. Amazing exhibits and collections and instructional videos as well as an educational area for children. The museum also has a remarkable gift shop with a diverse range of educational books, postcards, jewellry, t-shirts, bags and other cypriot handiworks. The building structure, old floor tiles and pillars only add to the experience - and if you need a break just take a seat in the enclosed garden and enjoy the sun!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"A wonderful structure, you not only get the chance to see the interesting displays of Nicosia history but the building itself is part of this history. Without any doubt a well-organized city museum. Like a miniature London museum (if you’ve been there you can get the analogy).Apart from all the above we had a personal interest since one of the wedding dresses was sewed by our mother back in 1962. Very moving to see one of her bridal gowns and her name on the information plate.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"Leventis museum is located in the old city of Nicosia within walking distance from Ledra street(central shopping str in old Nicosia).The old building was the house and medical practise of Themistoklis Dervis 1894-1968.He served as a mayor of Nicosia twice.1929-1946 and 1949-1959.He donated his house to the municipality and converted into a museum with his private collection of antiquities and other historical excibits.In 1989 , Leventis fountation took over the museum , restored it , upgreated it and added more excibitis from other private collectors.Excibits cover the whole history of Cyprus from pre-historic years until today.Well displayed and explained through posters, photos etc.Entrance is free and close only on Mondays.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

Many ancient wedding dresses displayed on the top level. Please visit if you are nearby you will enjoy it.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

It is small, compact and very well laid out and presented. It maintains your interest throughout. Quiet and free as well.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,Well laid out over three floors with lifts. This little museum just of Ledra street contains interesting displays from ancient times through to the British Empire.The Bridal gown exhibit which was coming to an end was very good. Classic venetian through to modern dresses bit boring for some of the gents though.Well worth a look for a brief look at Cypriot history.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,The story of the city laid out on three floors.Though to me the most interesting was the British section on the top floor.I thought it tended to jump about a bit.So there wasn't a lot of information about the last few years of colonial rule.There is absolutely nothing about the division of the island.At least they could document it.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,In old town Nicosia this building hosts a collection and takes one trough the whole history of Nicosia. Very well done.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,Nice history / archeology museum. Well documented with many informations about all historical periods.Interactive rooms for children (and adults) well made,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

40,Well presented little municipal museum in the heart of the old city of Nicosia.Gives the visitor a good idea about life in Nicosia in older times through the city's long history,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
30,"This museum is about the history of Nicosia. Naturally it starts with pre history but then goes on to explain later phases, the Francs, Venicians, Turks and British. All exhibits are clearly marked in Greek and English.I found this explanation of how Cyprus developed under constantly changing rulers very interesting.As well as the main exhibition there is an amazing display of wedding dresses and two private collections.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"This museum inaugurated in 1989 and honored with the European Museum of the Year Award in 1991; is a fascinating documentation of Nicosia History.The Museum includes several Galleries:- The Nicosia Gallery, with objects dating from the birth of the region and the ancient city (3900 BC-325 AD);- The Byzantine and Mediaeval Galleries (325-1489 AD) which have a unique collection of glazed vessels from the 13-16th century, as well as other objects presenting the city when it was capital of the Mediaeval Kingdom of Cyprus;- The Venetian Period Galleries (1489-1570 AD) containing a great collection of mediaeval and modern maps of Nicosia;- The Ottoman Period Galleries (1570-1878 AD) presenting the years of the Ottoman occupation.- The British Period Gallery (1878-1960 AD) demonstrating the city development during the English occupation.It is really fascinating and must visit.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"The museum is located in the center of the old city and it spans 3 exhibition floors and it is in chronological order in a way that the first floor has prehistoric artefacts (both archeological and geological), the second floor has ancient, medieval and ottoman artefacts, and the top floor is reserved for the history of Cyprus after independence. The signs are both in English and Greek and they give more than adequate information. Would definitely recommend a visit here.Suggested time here: 1-2 hours (depending on how throughout you read the signs).",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,A very modern museum that shares the history of Nicosia (and Cyprus) through lots of artifacts and images. You can see it all less than an hour or spend over two hours if you read everything. What makes it even better is that it's free.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,Good museum having fine examples of traditional Cypriot art on display. Entrance is free and it is a quite remarkable place. The only problem is that it is small and a visitor will not take more than 30 minutes to see everything.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"Because of its location (you can walk in the old city), I would highly recommend this if you are in Nicosia. Do not come to Nicosia for this...",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"Visited the museum as part of an organised tour, well worth a visit to understand more about the history of the island and its people.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"Beautiful building, artifacts and pictures of excellent quality. I went round the first time with a guide and saw all sorts of things I might have walked past otherwise [the stamp picturing a child and barbed wire that you have to buy to send a card or letter, money goes to refugees] I've been back twice [it's free] and thoroughly enjoyed it",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"We had a day excursion to Nicosia - not enough time!! After about 14 pick ups from hotels, a coffee stop at the Donkey café at Skarinou, we arrived behind schedule in Nicosia. We were led to this museum where we spent some time - and given detailed explanation of the many artefacts in chronological order. These were set on three floors and were an excellent display. There was a section on Lefkara lace with pictures of the locals making the lace. Toilets are on the lower floor but there are only two which makes it difficult for a large party such as ours - around 40 people! We were then taken across to the Turkish section to see the former Cathedral, now a Mosque and finally into the market where an explanation of the fruits and vegetables took place. Some people left the party to see the Whirling Dervishes in the building next to the mosque. We were then told it was free time to either eat or shop but with one hour, you couldn't do both. It was already gone 2.p.m. and in fact, the kind waiter packed up part of our meal as the main course was ready only 15 mins before we needed to be back at the bus. I suppose the trip whetted our appetite for a return visit but this time it would be on our own. Certainly, on this trip, the highlight was this museum which is well worth getting an overall picture of the history of the area. There is a small gift shop with books, postcards and several items to buy.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"If you are in Nicosia it worth a visit.You can combine a visit to museum with a walk to Old city of Nicosia.Its location is perfect near Ledras street.A lot of exhibitions, all the history of Cyprus until the independence, with chronological order.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

50,"Definitely a must visit museum, that is actually housed in two mansions, so you also get to see where richer people use to live. It takes you through the history of Nicosia, and thus Cyprus, in a very inspiring way. The museum was renovated not long ago and has an interactive section for children. Entrance is free, so, as I tell my friends visiting, you can go in and out as many times and days as you like. Also look out for the free exhibitions it organises from time to time, which are usually very interesting!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

40,"This museum has very well-designed exhibits explaining everything from the geological history of Cyprus to life in British Cyprus in the 1950s. Plus, there are often special exhibits. Currently, there is a large exhibit of some of the best of Cypriot lacework. The building is beautiful and historic (and worth seeing from the outside, even if the museum is not open.) Do not miss the two separate rooms on the ground floor where two families' special collections are displayed. Beautiful 2000-year-old pottery and jewelry. The city of Nicosia has more interesting (and a more interesting history) than many COUNTRIES!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,A real gem right in the heart of Old Lefkosia. The area and narrow streets outside the museum are alive with history with the surrounding buildings oozing stories of days gone by. Once you step into the museum you feel as though you have an entered some sort of blissful oasis. The permanent exhibits are simply fascinating and help to really set the scene as to what transpired in some crucial moments of Cyprus history. Well worth a visit.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,I am not normally a person who enjoys a trip to a museum unlike my wife but we were directed to this incredible museum by a very knowledgeable employee at the Tourist Office nearby.We comfortably spent a couple of hours taking in the amazing history of Nicosia and Cyprus from 3000 BC right up to the British ruleIt is very well set out and absolutely spotless venue and is a great place to visit to get away from the hussle and bussle of Nicosia,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,I never expected it to be so amazingly interesting. After the archeological museum - which is not to be missed - we headed for this jewel just off Ledra street which is in the heart and centre of this beautiful tidy city.

40,"Leventis Museum is a ""tour"" to Nicosia (and Cyprus) history from its birth thousands years ago until modern times. Going through the museum rooms one can realize how this town has grown.

40,You will learn the history of Nicosia and Cyprus at this beautifully restored old house. The organizers use beautiful signage and other state of the art techniques to tell the story. Galleries are organized by time period or in a few cases as the collections of important donors. The museum is free and well worth an hour of your time.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"This is my second visit to Cyprus and I have always wondered why there is so much British influence on this island. Well now I know after a short visit to this great little museum in the middle of Nicosia. Apart from history through the ages of the island, on the top floor it was devoted to the time of British occupation from 1878 to 1960.This is a place well worth spending a couple of hours.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

A visit worthwhile, and its FREE, with friendly staff!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,I really enjoyed the museum and the artifacts. It was well laid out and the displays well identified,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"The Leventis museum is inside the Venetian walls of Nicosia just outside of Laiki Gitonia. It's worth mentioned that the collection belonged to the Leventis family, and that is the reason it lacks some important artifacts of some of the historical era of Nicosia and Cyprus history itself. It's well ordered and labelled, and there's an animated video where you can watch Nicosia's history in just 15 minutes. At the entrance on the left if you look through the glass floor you can see some Hellenistic remains, which are dated back to the Neolithic period. Note that the entrance is free. A must-see if you are in the capital!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,It is a good place. We found it rather accidently but I think it is nice. We had good time there. The exhibits are well ordered and there are interesting explanations.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"This is a small museum, but does a good job of explaining and illustrating (with objects and photographs) the past of this city, as well as the surrounding region, from earliest times (fossils, etc.) through to modern times. There is also an exhibition space for changing exhibitions. The museum is air-conditioned which was very important to us the day we visited. There is an elevator in each of the two small wings. The only drawback is that it closes quite early. And it's all free! The guards are very friendly.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,This museum is free and is a nice cool place to walk around. It is not big but there are lots of interesting things to look at. The ceramics were particularly interesting.

50,An absolute must to your visit. Get to know Nicosia and Cyprus. Welcoming and friendly. Suitable for a family visit.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,Add this to the list of places to visit in the old city. The surrounding area is a tourist zone that extends all the way over to the occupied side of the city.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
30,"A nice museum when your in the area, but not a very large collection. The museum is well maintained and there's sufficient information. Also has a interessting british collection on the top floor. However comparing this museum to the Cyprus museum: missing historical artifacts from roman period and excaveted artifacts.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"It's always a good choice to visit the city musuem, if available, when you are interested in the history of the city. The history of Nicosia, closely linked to this one from Cyprus, is very rich. Thus a visit of this museum is recommended and besides it is for free. It is not a very big museum, so with a little time effort you can be quickly updated.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,If you are interested in the history of how Cyprus became split and would like to experience the weirdness of a split capital city...go over the borders! we went from the greek side to the Turkish side - our Passports were stamped and you get a good feel of the animosity between the nations. Lots to see and learn. Well worth the trip.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,I would definitely advise to visit this museum as it presents the history of Nicosia in a very straightforward way and you do not require a guide as most of the halls are self-explanatory.The museum is free to enter and its very central location hints that you shouldn't miss it while you are in Nicosia.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"On a whim we wondered into this museum and were thoroughly impressed. The collection is astounding and gives you a great sense of the multifaceted and multicultural history of the island. My favorite part was probably the fossils they had in the first exhibit and the pottery collections. It's not every day you get to see intact pottery from 4000BC! Definitely worth your time if you're killing time near Lidras street. Oh, and it's free!!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,A fascinating medium sized museum in the centre of the old city. Very well set out and organised. A very good potted history of Nicosia with lots of artifacts to view - be sure to obtain a map from the reception desk.Very friendly reception and security staff.Clean loos.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

50,"In the heart of the old city of Nicosia, a walk from the main municipal parking lot (Tafros), this small museum has so much to offer. The building alone is worth visiting. The permanent exhibition offers insides of the history of the island and the temporary ones are unusual and unique (lately it hosted drawings of children during the Turkish invasion!). Also the story of Mr Leventis is a stand alone tale for the guests. Pay a visit, it is definitely worth it!",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

There is a permanent exhibition about the history of Cyprus with an interactive film explaining it in different languages, there are plenty of examples of tools and jewels through the ages. There is also a display on other interesting countries of the world. The exhibition is set in the Constantine wing of the house. There is a museum shop as well which was nice to browse.I was expecting a larger exhibition after hearing so much about the museum, it was a little disappointing.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
10,"Although the museum is not bad, there needs to be some training done to the staff there - namely the security company, Group 4.HOW THE HELL can they expect a NINE year old to know that where there is a no flash photography sign, as there is throughout the museum, in one room this means no photography?Add to this the arrogant female security guard shouting at my son then this made it a terrible visit.Never again as they have NO IDEA how to treat visitors.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

The rooms are well structured and can be browsed easily.i highly recomend it for learning more about Nicosia and its long history.,Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
40,"I’d recommend the museum for two reasons. First, it gives a pretty good idea of the history of Nicosia and Cyprus. It’s interesting to trace how the island served as a kind of bridge between east and west and why it was a desired target for foreigners. Second, there’re few sights in the city worth visiting. So, strolling around the old part of the city, spend an hour there. The more so because the museum is air-conditioned, it makes a lovely break from Cyprus heat.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
50,"A very good effort, one of the best in Cyprus museums. I liked the features of accessibility - though improvements on that can be made - probably some more indications of museum navigation.

30,"After having been inundated with ancient history, it was a pleasant break to see more 'current' history. Specifically the era of the British in Cyprus was enlightening. Most of us have little idea of this era and some of us wonder how the British ended up with the military base in the south. This museum clears up these questions.

I was kicked out for DRAWING! it was an very strange experience and made me think less of the museum. After a long and upsetting fight i was let back in to exhibit but my day had already been ruined.

40,"A nice museum, located in a historic townhouse in the centre or Nicosia. The museum focuses on the history of Nicosia, but the story of the town and the country are sufficiently overlapping so that a visit to the Leventis Municipal Museum is also an excellent crash course on the history of the island as such.When the museum was founded, it did not have a single object to put on display. When it opened, the collection was a mere 300 pieces large. Paradoxically, the lack of a huge collection may have been a blessing: It clearly left the museum makers with no other choice than to pick out a number of highlights from Nicosia's history and to compensate the lack of objects with the use of modern scenography. The result is a highly modern, lean museum that focuses rather on the big picture then on thousands of details.The various rooms are dedicated to specific themes like the portrait of Catherine Cornaro (the last Lusigan Queen), the life style in Ottoman Cyprus and local craftsmanship in jewelry and pottery. This eclectic approach gives a good overview of historic milestones and cultural history on Cyprus. One interesting conclusion is that Turkish involvement in Cyprus did not start with the invasion of the north in the 1970ies, but 400 years before: The Ottoman Turks ousted the Venitians in the 1570ies and then ruled the island for more than 300 years, which may explain a couple of things also relating to the current political situation. The museum has also a nice anecdote precisely on ""the Cyprus question"": It tells the story how Nicosia's politicians in North and South, who fiercely opposed each other, finally agreed to have a joint sewage system for the town. Re-unification thus started with the treatment of sh**...",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia

50,"A friend and I visited this charming museum, set in a fine upper class house of Nicosia, and spent an especially pleasurable 2 hours viewing its displays. We didn't spend much time in the 'Orientation room', and I recommend you copy us. It is pretty self-evident. The Nicosia gallery (02) and Chronology Room (03) got similar short shrift, but children and those unfamiliar with the history etc., might want to spend a little time there. We wanted to see 'stuff' (like antiquities, 04 (Byzantine), 05 (Frankish), 17 (Severis Fam. collection), and 18 (Phylactou collection); Jewelry (14); Maps (10); etc.). There is plenty of great 'stuff' to see here, and the lifts are wonderful for those, like my guest, who have problems climbing and descending stairs. The museum is extremely well designed and a wonderful place to visit.",Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia
