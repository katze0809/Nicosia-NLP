40,"This used to be the Roman Catholic cathedral - St Sophia Cathedral. It was converted during the Ottomon takeover to a Mosque but, interestingly, they retained a lot of the christian features, such as the popes and saints on the arch over the doorway. The mosque is beautiful and requires time to appreciate and absorb. The Koran is alos very lovely, although a relatively modern one. Northern Cyprus has many such conversions of the old churches, but this is one of the best.",Selimiye Mosque
30,"Very strange construction. If you look at tho bottom, you expect to see a common church, but the towers are replaced by minarets. Very strange. If you take off your shoos, you can go inside. If you were already in a mosque, you know there is not much to see on the inside besides a huge carpet, so I didn't bother to go in.",Selimiye Mosque

50,if you are on the island this site and surroundings are one of the top three places to visit. the mosque converted from a church built 1293 is amazing. The conversion work was done in 1571. The general area has many shops and restaurants and bars walking around you will have many places to sit down and rest and also good for shopping. The mosque is named after the sultan Selim who was in the throne after the infamous Sultan Suleyman.Selim who loved wine and heard that the island of Cyprus has some of the best grapes for winemaking then he decides to conquer and send all Venetians off the island. It is a historical fact that the Venetians managed to be on the better side of the Ottoman Sultans so they were allowed to continue to control the island. after all 16th century the Mediterranean was a Ottoman lake but but Cyprus survived until Sultan Selim decides to drink better wine!Selim mosque and surrounding area is a must seeSent from my iPhone,Selimiye Mosque
50,We had passed over the border & decided to pay a visit and we are glad that we did. It once was Catholic but now a mosque and you can visit ( ladies please remember to dress appropriately - but there are headscarves you can borrow to cover your head) It's a beautiful building and very welcoming - calming as well inside.,Selimiye Mosque
50,"I really enjoyed my trip here. I attended during prayer time and was able to enter, even as a woman. I covered my head and removed my shoes and sat in the area reserved for women and enjoyed the whole atmosphere and the chants of the Imam. Very special indeed.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"When in Nokosia, cross the border to turkish side to be amazed with old architecture and time having stopped here decades ago",Selimiye Mosque
40,It was previously a cathedral of ayia Sofia. It is beautifully decorated but needs definitely renovation and also the surroundings.,Selimiye Mosque
30,"before this beautiful cathedral was destroyed it was impressive to see..now its rather empty and all ornaments have been cut out...a pity, yet it shows how things can change overnight...",Selimiye Mosque
40,"The Gothic church is important for Cyprus history, but is a surprise when you go inside and are standing in a mosque, with beautiful carpets on the floor, white painted walls and orientation towards Mekka. Both religions prove that they can create something beautiful together. Art can be a teacher to people,",Selimiye Mosque
30,Selimiye Camil mosque Nicosia is worth a quick visit if you are there. Impressive building but very little inside.,Selimiye Mosque
50,"It many respects it‚Äôs a bit of a bizarre sight as you make your way along the narrow Arasta Sokak, battling your way through shopkeepers attempting to promote their latest goods and mobs of clothes-hungry people putting in their finest efforts to haggle down the price of those fake designer T-shirts and handbags. You‚Äôll see minarets looming from what appears to be a gothic cathedral, with the flags of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus flying in-between. And if you have no idea of the history of this incredible building, you‚Äôll probably think it‚Äôs all a bit odd and unusual. Why, behind the soaring minarets which pierce skyline, does this Islamic place of worship look so much like a Christian cathedral? The answer is simple: it used to be one!It was built between 1208 and 1326 as the Roman Catholic St Sophia‚Äôs Cathedral, and at that time was the largest gothic church in Cyprus. It was adapted into a mosque after the Ottoman invasion in the 1570s by the addition of the two impressive minarets. Such conversions of non-Muslim places of worship into a mosque are certainly not unique.Standing in front of the building you‚Äôll see the beautiful three-pointed gothic-arched entrance, with a spectacular central doorway, though statuary and stained glass windows have been removed. Inside you‚Äôll see plain white walls and columns, disguising the decorated gothic stonework. The interior space is bright and simple, but it‚Äôs quite vast, holding up to 2,500 worshippers (it‚Äôs Lefko≈üa‚Äôs biggest mosque). The interior alignment has been slightly reoriented towards Mecca.You are able to visit if prayers are not taking place, but you will need to adhere to the appropriate customs with removal of shoes and appropriate coverings. If prayers are taking place, just stand and appreciate the magnificence of the building from the courtyard or street in front of itIt was one of the highlights of my visit to Lefko≈üa, and a ‚Äòmust-see‚Äô for the visitor.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"Lovely historic building used to be a church converted to a mosque hundreds of years ago, you can read that in detail in all the other reviews. The architecturally this is very nice and how they modified the church steeple to a minaret seamlessly is amazing. Just a peaceful place that is very welcoming and open to allOn a side note public toilets are available at the side of the mosque",Selimiye Mosque
30,"The interior walls are typically plain, having been whitewashed, the former stained glass replaced by geometric metalwork. I felt that it had a really sad air about it, despite it being bright inside. Intriguingly, and unusual in my experience, it has three mimbars. Oddly, there is a figure of a Saint, (Sophia?) still in place above the South door, and the adjoining chapel in the grounds has a relief of the raising of Lazarus, and animal gargoyles.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"The former Aya Sophia Cathedral in Nicosia is a splendid ornate Gothic building which dates back to the 13th Century but has now been transformed into a mosque, which is in regular use today.It is a mixture of building styles with its tall and minarets and heavily carved stone archways above the doors of the former Cathedral.Inside it is whitewashed, light and airy, the stained glass windows have all gone and are now just plain glass. The huge carpet hides the previous stone floor.This is symbolic of much of Northern Cyprus where churches have been converted to Mosques.",Selimiye Mosque
30,"This is now a muslim mosque which used to be a church. A very sad transformation, thought it still looks beautiful on the outside. The inside looks like most mosques which is very boring and not that exciting.",Selimiye Mosque
40,I came for a walk and entered the mosque leaving my shoes with another load outside. I checked my feet were clean out of respect. Walking with bare feet on the luxurious carpet adding to the serenity of this place. I visited the Lala Mustafa mosque in Famagusta which was also a cathedral in early years. Some much history engulfs northern cyprus.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"The former cathedral of St Sophia in Nicosia, a splendid example of ornate Gothic architecture which dates from the 1200s, has been transformed into an equally impressive mosque, in regular use today.It is a curious mixture of building styles, with its tall and elegant minarets soaring skywards, and heavily carved stone archways above the doors, such a familiar feature of medieval church architecture.Inside it is whitewashed, light and airy, and the windows - presumably once adorned with stained glass - now boast delicate latticework stone screens.The edifice is symbolic of Nicosia/Lefkosa's diverse historic character and certainly merits a visit if you are visiting the northern part of the city.",Selimiye Mosque
30,The outside is interesting but the inside has been ruined. There is not much more to say. Other mosques may be worthwhile visiting but not this one.,Selimiye Mosque

40,A place for tourists is what this mosque isn't. Its austerity compared to other mosques that draw crowds of tourists is what makes it precious.,Selimiye Mosque
50,"An interesting Mosque that started as a Catholic Church, before it was rebuilded into a Mosque. This can be seen on the inside where everything is angled towards Mecca. This creates some unusual architectural interior, because it was designed for this in the beginning. Would definitely recommend to see and it has FREE entry.",Selimiye Mosque
40,A nice to see transformation where architecture elements will tell you a lot about its history.Othman era,Selimiye Mosque

40,Visited this mosque in January. Pretty red floors with High ceilings and arches. One colourful window holds attention.,Selimiye Mosque

50,"As in other lands conquered by the Ottomans, the largest churches have turned into mosques. But under the carpetsfrom the mosque, sleeping forever, the Christian kings of Cyprus. Architecture is specific to Christian churches with mosques specific modifications.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"As an Atheist, its still God's house. Muslims uses it as a mosque since Ottomans conquer the island. There is no mistake, they just removed benches and apply to many carpets to the ground. No any changes on building (just they add ""minare"" at sides). People around there is helpful and if you ask them history of places around there they like to tell the story. Right side of the Cathedral, there is more interesting place which name is ""Bedesten"" older then Cathedral and nowadays you can find Semazen Show at there. It is very interesting that Followers of Rumi dancing in old christian temple.",Selimiye Mosque

40,This former Cathedral now Mosque is very close to the border crossing from the south to the North in Nicosia.It is a must see when in the Turkish quarter on the city.,Selimiye Mosque

30,"Viewed from the outside this is another fine religious building in the Northern Cyprus region of Nicosia. Formally a cathedral, it has been converted into a mosque, and is still in use today. There are scarves and skirts at the entrance that the females can borrow. It is simply decorated inside, but worth removing your shoes to step in and look. If nothing else, it is a welcome break from the summer heat.",Selimiye Mosque

40,"Originally a church and then turned into a mosque by the Ottomans (who added the minarets) this building is unlike any I have seen before. Flying buttresses supporting more flying buttresses, beautiful window shapes, decorated doorways in different styles and a flat roof. Even if you don't go inside, this is an amazing place to walk round and be staggered by the architecture",Selimiye Mosque

Why it needed to be tucked down inside her top we'll never know.Please don't take his behaviour in silence, shout at him and tell him to be ashamed. Muslim men are not allowed to touch women they don't have a relationship with.",Selimiye Mosque
30,This is a beautiful building and a great place to visit but I would warn any female visiting to be wary of the attendant on the door. I understand having to put on the skirt and headscarf to enter but I did not appreciate being molested by the attendant who was supposedly helping. He pushed the head scarf into my top and then my bra whilst coping a feel.I would never advise not visiting the site but they should think seriously about the people they have on site! Just be aware!!,Selimiye Mosque
10,"Today when we visited there was a guy in plaid shirt at the door who seemed to had a role to help with the robes for female visitors. While I was looking for the pieces he had already chosen two for my twelve year daughter and put them on her, tucked them in her shirt and shorts and touched her inappropriately all over her body! A second later he did the same thing on me!!! And he seemed to be there with his kids! Has anyone else had this terrible experience? I am sure he does this all day long! This guy must be stopped - any legal advice would be appreciated",Selimiye Mosque
20,"This Mosque is a nice piece of art from the outside. I like the way it is build. From the inside i miss the admosphare. The bookshelves are empty. No books. No pritty statues or anything. I‚Äôd say, stay oudside and enjoy the architecture.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Awkward to see minartes on a gothic cathedral. Probably a slight rebuke of the cathedral built in Mosque of Cordoba.,Selimiye Mosque
10,The fact that this church was desiccated and turned into a mosque means that it shouldn't even be considered for review,Selimiye Mosque
50,"This was a Christian church built in 1200 . It is gothic and beautiful. It became a mosque in 1570.It is beautiful, majestic andDo NOT miss visiting this.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Settled in a former Gothic Church, the Selimiye Mosque is worth the visit. It's very impressive to see how a former orthodox church became a mosque. Enter there with respect (not as a tourist I saw entering during prayer, despite all the messages informing not to...) Enjoy your visit, it's worth it!",Selimiye Mosque
40,"This is the former Catholic Cathedral which has been converted to a mosque. As such, entrance is allowed, provided shoes are left at the entrance. The beautiful architecture of the building is maintained but the interior is very austere - it is basically a big, empty carpeted area. Stained glass windows feature the geometric designs and patterns favoured by Islam rather than the figures and landscapes of Catholicism.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"This is a location which used to be a church and should have stayed that way!!!!It is on a main road which takes you from the main intersection on a road packed with fake designers (made in Turkey) and prices which is their salary for almost half year - I could not believe the audacity of the shop owners!!!!This location is beautifully kept and you have to remove your shoes as you enter the carpeted interior.Very few embellishments in Arabic, probably these guys anticipate that in several decades, after the 'union' this place will be restored to what it used to be. Trust politicians, eh?",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Outside is church, inside is mosque. Free entrance, just be respectful during prayer time. Place has some scarf in case lady forget to bring your own.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"The mosque is a converted church and it is very obvious to see from the architecture. The interior is like most Ottoman/Islamic style mosques although you can notice it was a former church from the very high ceiling and arches. If you are covering north Nicosia, you cannot fail to miss this landmark, so well worth a visit. There is also a former chapel right next to the mosque, which can be visited.",Selimiye Mosque
50,The architectural details are marvolous. When you enter this religous atmosphere you forget whatever religion you believe . You only feel the warmness around the people.,Selimiye Mosque
30,This church converted to mosque is much more interesting outside than inside - in fact there are few decorations inside.,Selimiye Mosque
30,"Nothing spectacular, the immediate area run down could do with a clean up! The place should have been kept as a church you don't see mosques being converted to churches!",Selimiye Mosque
30,"The interesting thing about this mosque is that it is a church converted into a mosque. If you have ever been to Spain, it is nearly always the other way round. You have to remove your shoes at the entrance, come appropriately dressed, and women have to cover their head (scarves are provided). When you enter you will see it is just a large carpeted void. But look at the carpet and you will see that the church orientation is all wrong for facing Mecca.It is also interesting that at the main door the carved 'mini bishops' still exist around the entrance doorway.But so far as mosques go, it is not particularly spectacular. It is free to enter, but you cannot enter during prayers.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Part of our self guided tour using the free map from tourist info . Well worth a look and makes a great photo,Selimiye Mosque
30,"Turkish and Turkish Cypriot flags flying, and minarets, underline the conversion of this former Catholic church. It has an interesting and rather turbulent (i.a. earthquakes...) history.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"This is a beautiful building and interesting inside and out. As a mosque, women are expected to put a headscarf on (available at entrance) and everyone remove their shoes. There is no cost to enter. However as others have stated this is a large almost empty building and you really need to go there with a local guide to get the most out of the visit. (or as a second choice have a guidebook with you)",Selimiye Mosque
30,"Still looks completely like a church from the outside, worth having a look inside as well. Attached some pictures for reference.",Selimiye Mosque
40,with flying buttresses turned into a mosque with two lovely minarets! White washed and very cool inside. Worth a visit for a pic of the exterior!,Selimiye Mosque
40,"There is a blue line set in the pavement of the Turkish side of Nicosia which will take you on a pleasant and easy going walking tour of all the main sites, including this cathedral turned mosque. Interesting to visit as it offers unusual access to, for many of us, quite a major mosque. The interior, as one would expect from any mosque, is minimalist but the exterior is very imposing. Shawls etc provided to cover heads for ladies and please respect dress codes as a matter of courtesy. We are the guests here!",Selimiye Mosque
50,"This ex-Catholic cathedral was long ago converted into a mosque, and the locals are very happy to welcome you to have a look around. You leave your shoes outside and there‚Äôs a rack of headscarves and modest coverings for visitors showing more flesh than Muslim dress codes are able to accept. There‚Äôs also a set of very clean attended toilets in the courtyard with a ‚Ç¨0.50 fee. Recommended - see the dervishes dance on the hour next door too.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"gorgeous piece of history, converted cathedral into a mosque. the grounds are beautiful too just to relax in.",Selimiye Mosque
20,Basically it's a big empty carpeted space with large columns and chandeliers. You have to remove your shoes and women have to cover their heads with a scarf. These are provided but I preferred to take my own. On the occasion of my visit it was empty apart from two women vacuuming the carpet and another near the entrance. To me it seemed rather lacking in atmosphere.,Selimiye Mosque
30,Our first time inside a mosque. Head scarves provided to borrow free of charge. Its a working mosque not a tourist site but we would have got more understanding if there was a bit more information. Ensure you are appropriately dressed.,Selimiye Mosque

30,"From the Lokmaci Gate check point no more than 6 min walk! The surrounding mosque area is very pleasant! The building is a very interesting ingineering construction, with more than 600 years!Inner decoration simple as the other mosques!",Selimiye Mosque
40,An interesting building both outside and inside the Mosque. You can visit when prayers are not taking place. Not sure of those times but there are plenty of bars and shops close by to occupy you till you can enter,Selimiye Mosque
40,I didn‚Äôt go inside the Mosque but the outside is pretty like any other old Catholic Church. It‚Äôs worth taking a look at it.,Selimiye Mosque
40,Very strange idea to convert an old church to a mosque... Why not to keep as a church and build the mosque somewhere else..,Selimiye Mosque
40,If you want to get a little bit more into the history of Nicosia then this is worth a trip as it‚Äôs old Nicosia and there are other things to see nearby. It won‚Äôt take up more than an hour but it is interesting to understand the history such as he communal baths,Selimiye Mosque
30,"Selimiye Mosque, formerly the Cathedral of Saint Sophia. Until the Ottomans conquered the island and commandeered the church, turning it into a mosque. The facade still retains the original and I can only imagine how magnificent the interior must have been until the Ottoman set about destroying and removing all Christian items.Sadly the only interesting thing about the interior is it's size and that it has three qibla instead of the usual one to show the direction of Mecca.",Selimiye Mosque
30,Disappointing that such a splendid building is now not seen in its true splendour but at least it is being used as a place of worship as sorts.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"I had zero ideas of what it was like to enter a religious site with so much history, but decided to try nonetheless on my own.One of the men at the mosque told me to cover my head and remove my shoes. I wasn‚Äôt offended or terrified partly because it is a cultural norm coming from multiracial Singapore. What caught me by surprise was that he offered to answer some of my queries about the place. I am grateful for the exchange of information in the short span of time. I am also cognisant that despite its very troubled past, the current place holds significant values for all Cypriots. Thank you!",Selimiye Mosque
40,Byzantine meets Ottoman meets 21st century. It isamazing how buildings sometimes endure all the influences of history. Its a bit confusing whether one is entering a church or a mosque but one thing is sure - one is entering a place of worhsip.,Selimiye Mosque
40,An impressive building with voluminous interior. Scarfs provided outside for free for women to cover their heads.,Selimiye Mosque
50,"On the 9th September 1570 when it had become apparent that Nicosia had no choice but to surrender the Venetian civilians in the city had gathered in the great Gothic Cath√©drale Sainte Sophie where Francesco Contarini, the Bishop of Paphos, delivered the last Christian sermon in the building in which he asked for divine help and exhorted the people. But all was in vain. It was decided that on Friday 15 September, the commander Lala Mustafa Pa≈üa would attend the first Friday prayer at the cathedral to herald the official conversion of it into a mosque. As he approached the cathedral the Latin bishop came out to meet him. He got hold of the reins of Pa≈üa‚Äôs horse and after he declared his loyalty to him he handed him the keys of the cathedral and asked for mercy for his congregation. Lala Mustafa assured him that noone was to be killed and that the city would not be sacked. In the meantime the Orthodox Christians had also gathered outside of the cathedral and having declared loyalty too they asked the Commander to grant them their religious freedom which was denied to them by the oppressive Latin rulers and the Church of Vatican. Lala comforted them by saying that he will immediately convey their request to Sultan Selim II in Istanbul. He further assured the Orthodox Christian Greeks that noone will harass them and that they will continue to live in their homes without fear. When it was time for the Friday prayer the Pa≈üa entered the cathedral with his retinue and performed his religious duty. The first imam of the mosque was Moravizade Ahmet Efendi who hailed from the Morea province of the Ottoman Empire. Lala Mustafa then climbed the stairs to the minbar and raised his sword in the air to symbolize the beginning of the Ottoman and Islam sovereignty in the island and declared: ‚ÄúFrom now on, Nicosia is under the protection of my sword, in the name of our gracious Sultan.‚Äù In 1570 two minarets were added to the cathedral as well as other Islamic features such as the mihrab and the minbar.For centuries the imams maintained the tradition of climbing the stairs to the minbar before Friday sermons and raised with two hands Lala Mustafa‚Äôa sword so as to signify the Ottoman and Islam rule in Cyprus. But this deep-seated tradition came to an end when the historical sword was stolen by treasure hunters in 1982 never to be recovered again.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Used to be a church and now a mosque. It is hard to get a full photo close up but you can see parts of it from several locations, especially if you are elevated. A short walk around for photos as you feel the area is all you need. But definitely part of your tour. Formerly St Sophia Cathedral, it dominates the landscape around it and if you do get a chance to be uphill a little farther out, the photos can be magnificent. There was still some work being done earlier this year for rome repair. For worshippers there is a women's section.",Selimiye Mosque
30,"Selimiye Mosque, in the centre of the old part of Nicosia (North side) used to be known as the Cathedral of Saint Sophia at which time it was a Roman Catholic cathedral, subsequently converted into a mosque. Impressive from the outside, and once inside (shoes off) it is worth a look around to note the changing architecture through the various eras.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"In it's day, this was a magnificent Christian site.The Ottomans rebuilt the site after capturing the city in 1570 and converted it to a mosque. The interior is very plain having been stripped of all Christian art, etc. The building is more impressive from the outside than with. Having said that, it is worth noting the added mirihab that indicates the direction of Mecca for prayers (off to the right as the church is orientated east to Jerusalem).",Selimiye Mosque
40,"In the centre of the old town in Turkish Nicosia, this is an interesting place of worship which was built as a christian cathedral but is now a mosque, with architecture reflecting its changing history over the centuries. Inside is both peaceful and spectacular in an understated way.It is open to visitors throughout the day, except at prayer times. All visitors must remove their shoes, and ladies are expected to cover themselves, including their hair. It is free of charge, and 30 minutes is about right for a visit.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Originally a cathedral converted into a mosque after the Turkish invasion. Lots of the original features remain.As with other mosques, shoes should be taken off before entering. There are gowns by the entrance so women can 'cover up' before entering/",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Having begun life as a Catholic Church and being part destroyed, it is now a mosque and has a minaret strapped to one side of a broken tower. Some wonderful Baroque architecture - especially the doorways. The golden stone glows in the sunshine. Windows that once would have had stained glass in them are all filled in with decorative perforated bricks - never seen anything quite like it. It is on a large scale and you can walk all around the building and , removing shoes, go into the mosque. Worth a visit to help understand the history of this island.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"This is a gothic cathedral converted to a mosque. You will know it by the two towers with North Cyprus flag hanging between them, and the minaret of course. The muzzin? sings extremely loudly from it, so watch out, can be deafening right below! What was interesting ot me was the conversion. Inside the entire area is carpeted, the walls are whitewashed and some selected, not tons, very nice geometrical design work is added. It should be clear this is on North (Turkish) side, so you need to go through border control. Not a big deal, but be prepared with passport.",Selimiye Mosque

Previously a cathedral, it's in a sort of baroque, renaissance style, the architecture is amazing, and the doorways are so beautiful. To get inside, you have to dress for a mosque, and when you get inside, the floor in covered with carpets (I heard that the floor was made with tombstones), and the walls are completely white. But the outside is divine, and so are all the other parts of it around. Definitely go see!",Selimiye Mosque
40,"We crossed the green line at Ledra St. and strolled in the Turkish sector.This was an interesting building, a mixture of Christian and Muslim architecture outside and in. A mosque with Gothic arches etc. It makes you think of the division but also the assimilation of Cyprus.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"When the Franks took over Cyprus in 1192 , introduced their culture and religion(Roman catholism).They started building their own churches.Actually three of them are worth of mentioning.In Nicosia the Cathedral of Agia Sofia (named Selimiye mosque by the Ottoman in 1572).In Famagusta the Cathedral of St.Nicolas and at the Bellabais village the Bellabais abbey.The Cathedral of Agia Sofia , initially used by the Franks-Roman catholic then the Venetians-Latins and the Ottomans-Muslims converted the two cathedrals into mosques that they are used until today.During Venetian times, crown of Venetian Kings of Cyprus took place in the church.The architecural details are unique for Cyprus.The Gothic arches and rose windows are incredible.The cathedral is in Nothern Nicosia very close to Ledra street check point.",Selimiye Mosque

Builded in the center and then almost destroyed by the ottoman turks. Added the minares afterwards and removed the statues from the faccade.

30,It used to be Saint Sophia churchThe Turks have transformed it to an impressive mosque but the building itself need restoration.,Selimiye Mosque

40,Religions come together to show a beautiful adaptacion of a Catholic Church into a Mosque. The arquitecture is Gothic but it was turned into a Mosque... it is incredible on the outside as well as on the inside.Please be mindful if you visit and respect the local customs and signs requesting you enter the Mosque without shoes and the ladies should wear a scarf covering their heads (they provide them at the entrance). We saw many ladies in a tour next to us disregarding this and they were admonished for that.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"I think I went to this place expecting too much. It has been an ancient Cathedral which lately was converted into a Mosque. So the architecture is purely Cathedral type other than a few hoardings written in Arabic letters. Unlike many other mosques, this place is opened for any tourist (even for the non-Islamics). It looks huge from the outside, looks like a fortress with those two giant towers. But from inside it is a large dome of a cathedral, and there are no visits to the towers etc :) Keep like 30 mins for the visit.",Selimiye Mosque

40,"If it wasn't for the two minaret towers, you'd think you are about to enter a European cathedral. Yet there are clear indications of the true nature of this building: you must take your shoes off before entering, ladies must wear a head scarf etc.The building is beautiful both outside and inside, and a visit is highly recommended.",Selimiye Mosque
50,It is weird to see a 13th century european cathedral building in the heart of a muslim enclave. The signs of christianity have been stripped out and all painted white within.Stained glass has been replaced by plain. Statuary has been removed. A thick absract patterned carpet covers the floor - the unevenness caused by christian gravestones underneath. Tip - take thin socks to cover your feet if you are wary of walking barefoot on carpet as all shoes must be removed before entering.,Selimiye Mosque
40,Best photographed from the observation tower in Ledra Street! While nowhere near as ornate as it's more famous counterpart in Istanbul the mosque is well worth a visit. It is atmospheric. A stroll around inside clearly shows it's Christian origins as indeed does the exterior. The exterior is now marked by the Turkish Flags flown between the minarets.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"This former church (built during the Crusades) became a mosque centuries ago under the Ottoman Empire not, as is generally believed, when Turkey raided Cyprus in 1974. Worth a visit, although the exterior is, perhaps, more interesting than the interior.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"be careful in the praying time to be silent and remove your shoes on entrance, which it worth doing it because it is a very old cathedral which was turned to a mosque after ottoman empire.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"History, religion and cultures gave this place such a warm feeling. Take off your shoes, step and soak up the atmosphere. Ladies must cover their heads.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"This Catholic church was long ago converted into a mosque. It's a pity the colours of stained glass windows and pictorial depictions have gone. The effect is a severe white interior - a kind of frozen deadness. Chilling, but we must admit that at least it still stands as a historical symbol of change. I am an atheist but it strikes me that, if possible, temples of such art and architectural effort ought to be preserved as they were. Well worth a visit.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"I had never been before inside a mosque and it was a very interesting visit, although this one is a converted former cathedral. Entrance is free and they let you take all the pictures you want. A great place to stay out of the sun while in the Turkish side of Nicosia and walk bare foot on a very comfortable carpet.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Very impressive must see building if you are in the Turkish side of Nicosia. Found the building to be very peaceful. The history and story behing the building is worth reading up on. The original architect is the same as for the Notre Dame in Paris.,Selimiye Mosque

30,"Yes, this is building you must see if you are in Nicosia. On first sight it was clear that Selimiye Mosque was Roman Catholic cathedral converted into a mosque, still nice and stll interesting ... then, hmm .. so, as you come to the mosque from Ledra Crossing Point, you shuould go to the left if you want to find some nice gift shops and restaurants, but, if you'll go on the right most likely you'll find just dirt and ruines ... pitty ..",Selimiye Mosque
40,"The Selimiye Mosque is situated in the Turkish part of the city. When you see it on first sight, you would be impressed of the beauty of the building itself. But, as you come closer, you can see this was once a cathedral. All the statues and decorations of it were taken of or demolished so the cathedral can be used as an islamitic mosque. I can't believe that the religion of the same building can change just because some statues are taken away. The architect of the cathedral is the same architect of the Notre Dame in Paris. Inside the Mosque, the only thing you see is white walls and a big carpet. The Mosque fot me also looked empty and had no warm feeling at all. We found it nice to see, but were sad about the change of the cathedral to a mosque",Selimiye Mosque
50,"This splendid building has been transformed into a mosque, which has taken away some of the beauty of the old cathedral designed after French Gothic cathedrals, but the architecture and the view from the top are totally worth your attention. Don't miss the northern door, you can easily take some great shots. It will probably take you about 3-4 hours and do wear comfy shoes.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"From the Shakolas town one gets almost a 360 degree view of Nicosia. Binoculars are available at the desk. Peer over the Green Line into the Turkish quarter, and right across the Greek Cypriot sector. To the far distance one can see the Penatdactylos range. Hopefully the video speakers are working probably if you decide to view the documentary on the city. On the day i visited they weren't working. Some of graphics can do with a sproose up as they suffer from light fatique. Enjoy!",Selimiye Mosque
20,"I did not find this mosque very interesting. We were asked to leave as the afternoon prayers were starting. Someone had tried to steal shoes while we were here. It did not seem very interesting, just another mosque.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Interesting to see how a 700-year-old cathedral was repurposed as a mosque. Remember that it is best to wear appropriate clothing. Women can borrow a wrap and a headscarf.,Selimiye Mosque
40,If you've never been inside a mosque this is a great one to visit. Dress very conservatively and leave your shoes outside.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"In every religion there are places of worship, filled with wealth and richness. But the true advertizers for a religion are the simple places. Like this mosque. Simple and elegant, the focus on the function of the faith, not on the wealth of the faithful.",Selimiye Mosque
30,"Probably the 'must see' site in the Turkish part of Nicosia (Lefkosa). From the outside the architecture is quite stunning - it is an old cathedral converted to a mosque. We waited a couple of times to go in as it was prayer time, but when we eventually managed to go inside it was rather disappointing. Quite plain, and ten minutes is all you'll need to have a look.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"If you get lost always arrange to meet out side front of Mosque,you can not miss it from anywhere in the city,the towers are so overwelming.This as all mosques in North are used by calling all faith full followers to prayer,through load speakers ,so respect this,you can enter when no prayers but take your shoes off before you enter,leave them out side,do not mix them up and take someone elses,as many tourists do,?There is a washing area out side for the faithfull,next door is old Cathederal,usully with entrance,partly renovated,.This is all in good state of repair so well worth a visit.",Selimiye Mosque
30,This mosque is a converted cathedral and is a lovely building. There are lots of lovely views around the outside of the mosque but the inside is not very ornate. I was hoping to see more Islamic decorations but it is rather plain.Worth a quick look if you are visiting Nicosia.,Selimiye Mosque
30,"Worth a quick view of the exterior, but inside it doesn't seem to have anything particularly striking. Also, you might not be able to get a clean shot of the (former) church front doors and the current minarets, as there was a lot of obstacles in the way (e.g. electricity post).",Selimiye Mosque
30,We arrived just as a call to prayer went out. So we stayed outside in the heat and marvelled at the architecture which sadly seems to be not looked after. You can pay Euro 7 next door to see the whirling dervishes but we couldn't take the heat that long. Next time!,Selimiye Mosque
30,This is the main mosque in northern Nicosia. I had seen this from afar on previous visits to Nicosia and now I had the chance to look at it close up. All n all an interesting experience but there are other mosques that are more impressive.,Selimiye Mosque
40,The architecture is worth seeing if that interests you. The history is also worth looking into. On the walk through the old town that leads to shops and markets. Stop by.,Selimiye Mosque

30,"We visited this Mosque as part of an organised tour of Nicosia, this mosque is obviously on the Turkish side of Nicosia after you cross the green line. As previously stated it was originally a cathedral and has now been covered into a mosque, the outside of the building is still interesting with most of the original features. The inside has been stripped of all it original decoration and is mostly painted in plain white, there are some islamic features on display but after visiting several other mosques on our travels we were slightly disappointed. Overall we were glad we visited this site and experienced the peace and calmness inside.",Selimiye Mosque
30,So it's a grand cathedral that is now a mosque - very nice but not really anything more to see or understand. Decoration has been removed and usual mosque rules apply re covering up but inside is bare as for all mosques just really a carpet to pray on.,Selimiye Mosque
20,"The inside of the mosque is mainly whitewashed walls with no decoration to speak of, a nice carpet on the floor though. There is no one to give any guidance or provide information about the Mosque and the religious practices. You get the feeling of being tolerated rather than welcomed.",Selimiye Mosque
30,The outside is quite pleasant especially if you like stone carving and it is interesting that they have not removed or defaced the figures around the main door. Inside is quite plain although the light through the windows is lovely. Don't forget to cover legs and women should not have strapped tops and must cover their heads. There are scarves available at the door.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"The mosque is not very interesting inside.The exterior is imposing, an old gothic cathedral, with many ornaments.There is a nice restaurant in the courtyard.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"We visited here as part of our cultural tour. Our guide pointed out the tolerance of the Muslim faith - instead of knocking down a Christian Cathedral (St. Sophia) the building was converted into a Mosque. So retaining the original building for posterity.There was a lovely peaceful feeling in the Mosque / Cathedral.Please respect the faith of those now using the building. Ladies take a head scarf - though some are provided. To all be truly respectful, do not wear shorts. You will find some Mosques do provide a wrap around skirt.Talk and learn.

40,"Wonderful place to visit interesting history and great gothic architecture, One of the places to visit in Nicosia.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"On a hot day this is a haven of peace and tranquillity. This was once a church which explains the carvings of bishops and angels above the doorway and the architecture. Like other mosques I've been to, it is sparse inside which actually gives more room for contemplation. In a case to one side was a hand written book with beautiful calligraphy, presumably of quotes from the Koran, surrounded by glorious detailed painted patterns. It is important to dress respectfully, helpfully, scarves are provided to borrow by women.",Selimiye Mosque
50,It was a beautiful church before it was changed in XVI century for a mosque. Now is white inside but you can find some places with original structure.,Selimiye Mosque
30,"Maybe as I'm belonging to the 1000 minaret country which is Egypt, I found the mosque (former saint Sophie church) is normal, nothing of big attention there.It's a church with a 2 huge Minaret to be turned into mosque, so it's not belongs to Islamic monuments type as in Egypt, which reflects the true Islamic Arts.",Selimiye Mosque

50,"During our self guided walking tour of Lefkosa we enjoyed many attractions. This one was a highlight for us as it demonstrates the effect different empires have had through the ages. Starting life as the cathedral of st sophia, it was built in the Frankish/Lusignan period in the gothic style. It was used for the coronation of the Lusignan kings. When the Ottomans arrived it became a mosque and they placed minarets on the unfinished belfries. Awesome photo opportunities - our favourite was the multiple flying buttresses.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"Selimiye Mosque fascinates with its cultural mix, in the same time religious practice. Since 16.cent. used as main mosque, it used to be a royal church of the Western rulers of Cyprus. Built to demonstrate power with a place of worship, it combines different cultures in a fascinating blend. May it be used in dedication to respect towards other religions and faiths.",Selimiye Mosque

40,"Very beautiful place, I am not sure when it was converted to Mosque however the Church was built with a beautiful structure. The place is kept very clean and open to visitors. Once inside, you really gets lost in the history.Once you cross the border, its one of the attractions which comes quite close by. Do visit.",Selimiye Mosque

30,+Not crowded+Very soft carpet+Free to go in+Close to the border-Very simple inside-Not much to do in there,Selimiye Mosque
50,It is very beautiful building and (from what I know) it is the only mosque in the world in Gothic style as it used to be a church.,Selimiye Mosque
40,An interesting piece of history you can walk around. You can see the original Gothic architecture hiding behind the conversion to a Mosque. It is a short visit and it is a short walk from the Buyuk Han. Don't miss it if you are in the vicinity. They provide the means to cover up if you feel your clothing is too exposed (although we didn't see anyone fussy about the way people were clothed and plenty of people entered with shorts).,Selimiye Mosque
50,"This former cathedral built in the thirteenth century was adapted by the Ottoman and converted into a mosque with the addition of minarets. It really is an impressive structure from the outside with some superb carved stone detailing. Open to all you can easily access and view the interior. The complete whitewash inside takes away some of the wow factor but even then it just looks huge and still very impressive. I wandered round for about twenty minutes or so, no shoes allowed as with all mosques, and took in how it looked now and imagined how it would have been as a cathedral. Don't miss this place as externally there are additional small buildings which add to the feel of the place and it is undoubtedly one of the sights to see in Nicosia.",Selimiye Mosque
50,Beautiful Mosque. Built in the original materials of the area. It has a lovely interior and offers scarves for those that have forgotten. Good place to visit.,Selimiye Mosque
40,We came across it on our way to Sabor restaurant. Its right next to it. The kids were allowed to walk in. They enjoyed it a lot. You can sit outside and hear the prayers via the loudspeakers,Selimiye Mosque
50,This mosque used to be a church and in time they have added minarets during the ottoman empire to convert it to a mosque. Great historical place to visit,Selimiye Mosque
50,"Impressive architectural building resembles to famous medieval cathedrals of France.I really enjoyed visiting,once you step in this area you feel like if you are in Turkey even you can buy Turkish goods there.My sons did their prayer in this Mosque , great place to visit , don't miss it .",Selimiye Mosque
50,"The most imposing building of both parts of Nicosia is this Mosque, originally the St. Sophia Cathedral.It was built in the French Gothic style during the 13th cent. Carved stone arches are greatly preserved at the entrance. Two minarets were built by the Ottomans instead of the belfries.You can freely enter the Mosque (if there is no service), but the interior is disappointing as everything is whitewashed. Due to that it looks even more bigger, but empty and soulless.",Selimiye Mosque
50,Located on the Turkish side 5 minute walm from kera street crossing...well worth the visit. Ladies ...check your outfits or take something to cover up with or you will be waiting outside.. located next to the old marketplace lots to buy in here and one of the cheapest coffee shops around,Selimiye Mosque

50,Very nice building with a lot of architectural details. Nice for historical researchers and students üëç,Selimiye Mosque
40,"Formerly the cathedral of Santa Sophia, this great gothic church was turned into a mosque in the 16th century, leading to the removal of the vast majority of Christian features ‚Äì internally it is now a vast hall and the internal walls have been whitewashed. The glass front visible from inside is good.Externally crosses have been removed although around the main entrance there do remain small statues of saints. Islamic features such as turrets have been added.I found the inside quite interesting and peaceful but unless you can translate arabic you will be unable to understand the writings on display ‚Äì I assume these are from the Koran.This is of course a working mosque so you can not visit when services are in progress unless you are a Muslim.As with all mosques you must remove your shoes before entering. Women must cover their heads (scarves are available).I had not previously been inside a mosque and while it was good to visit, the plain nature of the interior left me wondering what it would have been like prior to its conversion.",Selimiye Mosque
50,I was fascinated by this place. At first glance it looks like a Christian cathedral but then the current muslim use becomes obvious. You have to remove shoes and wear appropriate clothing to enter but it is worth it. There was a woman at the door who helped us to cover up. My daughter had to put on trousers and a head scarf. Inside was very peaceful and spacious. It was shortly after prayer time and there were still people praying and small groups of men just relaxing. We felt relaxed looking around though. It was interesting seeing how the interior has been converted to its present day use with all christian artefacts removed. The children all appreciated the different religion too. A must visit if you venture into Northern Nicosia.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"I visited the mosque in the afternoon, outside it looks like a gothic church however inside everything is covered with paint and only the structure may remind of the catholic church style.Nice to see, no worthy the visit inside.",Selimiye Mosque
30,Mix of cultures. You can see it was a church first but it was stripped of all it's beauty. Now it's a sober mosque. Worth a visit if you're in North Nicosia.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"As others have said, this mosque/former cathedral is well worth a visit. It is an unusual experience, the history of the place is fascinating and the building itself absolutely magnificent. Made all the more so inside by the spartan decor characteristic of its present usage. Also a great way to get out of the heat for a while! Women will need to cover their heads to respect the religious custom of the mosque, scarves provided.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Add this to your list of sights to see on a walking tour of the old city. Just remember that all decorations of the original building are for the most were long removed or destroyed after the Turkish conversion to a mosque.,Selimiye Mosque
40,Very unusual experience. Former gothic cathedral turned into a mosque. The ambience seems a bit tense. All (Christian) decorations have been removed from the outside and inside of the cathedral and is now actively used by muslims for prayer. Keep this in mind when your visiting. Respectfull clothing is necessary. But the experience is worth the trip.,Selimiye Mosque
40,Great little piece of history in the heart of town. Captured by muslim invaders and repurposed as a mosque. Highlight of the visit was an irate German lady blasting the imam because she refused to cover her head to walk inside. And fair enough too.,Selimiye Mosque
50,"The former cathedral was build in the 13th century and was converted by the Ottomans into a mosque in the 16th century.The architecture is amazing, although the structure was damaged several times by earth quakes over the centuries.Muslim, non-Muslim, you are welcome to walk in and enjoy the wonderful work of the art of the past. Take a moment to reflect, pray, or just relax and enjoy the sound of silence.The glass front and its colors will amaze you, the entrance/gate is a game of harmony, and the interior shows both Christianity and Islam.",Selimiye Mosque

50,Amazing mosque built on an old christian church Hagia Sophia. Worth a visit. Women should dress up properly (there are long skirts and scarfs to borrow).,Selimiye Mosque
40,Interesting to see how the crosses have been torn down and minarets added to the former church tower. Big and silent place. visit recommended.,Selimiye Mosque
50,"The Selimiye Mosque is a surprising gem. Built originally as the St Sophia Cathedral by the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus between 1208 and 1326, it was converted into Hagia Sophia Mosque when the island became a Turkish possession in 1570. At that time all the interior and most of the exterior decoration was removed and the walls whitewashed but the simplicity accentuates the soaring gothic columns and criss-cross ceiling vaulting.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"This mosque is on the Turkish side of Nicosia, and well signposted if you are walking. However, it is nowhere near as impressive as the mosques in Turkey. So if you've seen the places of worship in Istanbul this might feel like a let down.It is nice enough and has historic significance. But it looks quite plain inside and is only worth a brief detour.",Selimiye Mosque
50,This is a place that must be visited in Nicosia. It is amazing how this gothic church turned into a Mosque. The place is peaceful and quite. The inner part of the mosque is surprisingly amazing. The two big minarets can be seen thorough Nicosia.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"The Cathedral now the Selimiye Mosque was built between 1209 and 1228 AD it was built over a previous building .These ancient ruins were discovered in 1976 on the south side.The church was damaged by earthquakes in 1491 and 1547 .When the Ottomans took the city in 1570 they converted the inside to a mosque known then as the Hagia Sophia Mosque and in 1954 it was remamed the Selimiye Mosque. So much history!!It is amazing inside very beautiful - leave your shoes at the door and dress appropriately and look at the columns, the carpet and enjoy the quiet.The two tall minarets of the mosque are a landmark in Nicosia.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Super intriguing how they took this old Gothic style church and made it into a Mosque. We were there during prayer so we could not go in but the outside was impressive and sparked a lot of questions regarding the history of Cyprus.,Selimiye Mosque

50,"It is astonishing to see how a cathedral has been converted into a mosque. The windows have been replaced with Middle Eastern ""fretwork"" decoration, and the inside is painted white. As Mecca is not in the same orientation as the Christian church everything is ""sideways"".",Selimiye Mosque

40,"A cathedral turned mosque - this is an absolutely stunning building built in a gothic style. It is well worth crossing the border at Ledra Street to visit this building.Unfortunately, there were prayers in progress at the time we arrived and so we were not able to go inside, but just walking around the outside and gazing upon the amazing architecture is enough to give you a sense of the grandeur of this mosque and an appreciation of its construction.The inside, by all accounts, is no less impressive and its just a shame we did not get to visit it.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"Incredible image of a Gothic cathedral turned into a mosque.White walls, Coran inscriptions, prayer places, shoes at the front steps...a twist of emotions, very interesting to see.I think it's probably the most powerful moment I experienced in North Nicosia, the moment I realized how everything around us is nothing more than a projection of what we choose to make of it...",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Active mosque so haven't actually entered but all the area surrounding Selimiye is lovely. There's a covered market nearby for food and trinkets, the long shopping road which continues over the border (you can walk across here if you have your passport) and the road then turns into a very European shopping street.

40,"The mosque and its courtyard reflects the beauty of the French architecture of the Middle Ages. A well preserved building. If you happen to be in Nicosia, remember most of the historical sites are in the North. After this St. Sophia Cathedral or Selimiye Mosque in today's name, please allow some time in this quarter of the old city as you will find hidden treasure in stone buildings. Mine was a beautiful restaurant near the mosque.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Under Venetian rule this was originally a Christian church. After the Ottomans conquered Cyprus in the 1570's it was turned into a Mosque. So the elaborate Christian decorations were removed. This has left a massive peaceful chamber. An unusual feature is that the carpet is laid diagonally so that it faces Mecca. A good place to retreat from the bustle of the city and heat of the day.,Selimiye Mosque
30,"Good to look at from the outside and peaceful on the inside, like all mosques. It's located in a district full of narrow streets with markets and interesting little shops (visit ther Buyiuk Han!)",Selimiye Mosque
50,"Yet again its another fantastic looking Cathedral that has changed hands into the Muslim faith, I am an Atheist but I can spend hours marveling at the work it must have taken to build these massive ornate buildings.The christian faith knew how to build elaborate places of worship and its a shame that there isnt the same sort of detail in modern architecture instead of the fast method of steel and concrete.All the same you just have to look at the huge vaulted ceilings and wonder what it must have been like when these places where first finished. The only fault with the conversion into the Muslim faith is inside it has all been painted white covering up all the stone, to me that is the worst thing you could do, stone should be seen in its natural form.It still is a beautiful building and well worth a visit.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"When converting, the Muslims are never shy, take down the Christian symbols and hang up the islamic ones, building stays rather untouched.recommend, Nr 2 site to see in occupied zone",Selimiye Mosque
50,"As described, a previous church turned into an active mosque where West would meet East.

The inside has another twist with a beautiful church roof with an old Ottoman pulpit. Mosque in use so please enter with respect and decently dressed.",Selimiye Mosque
40,Well it is true that when you have seen a few this might just be another mosque but i loved the architecture of it and i also love the quietness inside.We attended a performance of the Swirling Dervish in the building next door. It was 7 euro entrance and a lady explained to us in broken english the story of the dervish. The performance itself was beautiful. The setting and lightning was adding to the beauty of the performance.Well worth a visit.,Selimiye Mosque
40,"Originally a church but turned into mosque so outside looks like an archetypal cathedral and inside typical mosque, strange to see but works. Please touristS be respectful and dress appropriately this is a place of worship",Selimiye Mosque
50,"From the outside this building is an exquisite example of Gothic architecture, and its massive.I've walked around the building many times, and at night it is very prettily lit up and an attractive backdrop to the popular restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood. From this angle, I score the Cathedral a 5.However, today I made the mistake of going inside, and I wish I hadn't. There is nothing left of the original Cathedral, nothing, no altar, no side chapels, no carvings or decorations. It was all stripped out back in the 16th century, and it is a sorry sight. The soaring vaulted roof gives an impression of how big and impressive the Cathedral was originally, but it has lost its personality.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"The Selimiye Mosque can easily be visited by non-Muslims and is a good and rewarding experience. It is located in Northern Nicosia near the Green Line dividing the City. One can arrive their easily from S. Nicosia - the larger Greek side -- via the no-hassle checkpoint on Ledra Street. In front of the mosque note the ablution fountain in the forecourt where the faithful must wash before entering to prey. The building was originally a large cathedral built by the French beginning in the 1200's so is in the Gothic style. When the Ottoman Turks took Cyprus from the Venetians in 1570 the church was converted to the mosque that you see today. Much of the elaborate Christian decoration -- carvings, wall paintings and colorful windows -- in the Gothic style were removed as Muslims prefer a much simpler, purer architecture and abide no graven images. Minarets were added and the orientation of the church was changed so that those preying faced Mecca. You can see it in the layout of the carpets facing the holy city and the decorated pulpit.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Not far from the South Nicosia Lidras Street Border Crossing you can easily see this attraction as the twin 50m high minarets are hard to miss.Originally erected by the Lusignan Kings from 1208 to 1326 this is the oldest and finest example of Gothic architecture in Cyprus. Formally called the Cathedral of St. Sophia it was once regarded as the most magnificent Christian sacred building in the Middle East... Until it was taken over by the Turks in 1570 and turned into a Mosque. The Turks stripped the building of all images of animals and people and chipped away the Gothic sculptures in the main portal.Despite the 'Mosque modifications' the building is still impressive and the minarets, although obviously out of keeping with the Gothic Cathedral do make the building even more interesting. Inside the Christian icons have been stripped, red carpet has been laid and the whole interior has been painted white, leaving a feeling of open space and huge scale.You have to respect the muslin religion by removing your shoes and covering up properly to enter. There is no entrance fee and it is great to walk around inside and enjoy the silence and the sheer impressive scale of the Selimiye Mosque.",Selimiye Mosque

The building is the largest and oldest surviving gothic church in Cyprus, it was converted to a mosque following the Ottoman occupation in 1570.You are free to look around the inside of the Selimiye Mosque but obviously you must remove your shoes and women must cover up (scarves are available at the entrance). The atmosphere is very friendly and you are allowed to take pictures and video inside. The architecture is magnificent and well worth a visit.",Selimiye Mosque
50,"The stunning architecture, inside and out, of this gothic building is hard to describe. I fell in love with the ceilings, arches, entrance ways - you name it, I took photos of it! You can go inside and there are scarves for women to use to cover up as needed. It's worth going in, very quiet and you can walk around admiring the architecture. It is worth noting that it was once a cathedral: I think that adds to the historical interest of the building.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Santa Sophia Cathedral, Nicosia. The medieval, gothic cathedral of Santa Sophia in Nicosia (Lefkosia), in Turkish or ‚Äònorthern Cyprus‚Äô is an amazing relic of the bygone age of the crusaders on Cyprus. It‚Äôs all the more interesting that it has been a mosque for over four hundred years, as it still is today. It‚Äôs the centerpiece of many interesting historical buildings in the Turkish half of Nicosia, now very easily accessible from the southern, Greek side through the very relaxed Ledra Street border crossing. For me the Turkish part of Nicosia is vastly more interesting than the southern Greek part, and the cathedral of Santa Sophia is part of that, as well as the old church beside it, often called by its nickname ‚Äòthe Bedestan‚Äô. It‚Äôs been restored recently and dance and music recitals are often held in there now. Nearby is the Buyuk Han, an Ottoman caravanserai that has been converted to a great place for souvenirs and arts and crafts. There‚Äôs a nice restaurant called Sabor just to the north of the back of the cathedral that I though was really good. The little caf√© in the gothic structure just to the southeast was a rip off. They overcharged me.",Selimiye Mosque

50,"The Selimiye Mosque is a beautiful combination of islamic and gothic architecture, a building that faces the historical changes who can tell you the stories of the Lusignans and of the Ottomans. The building is very big and imposing, like any other gothic cathedral in Europe, but the inedit fact is that inside is a mosque, with no paintings on the walls and without statue, thing that gives to this building an unique charm.",Selimiye Mosque
40,We visited the Mosque while we were in Nicosia. It was a strange experience. You get the feeling of the cathedral from the outside but inside it is very much a Mosque. I suspect many religious art works have been covered up in the conversion as it was obviously a lovely cathedral before it became a Mosque. However it is a nice space and very peaceful. Worth a visit.,Selimiye Mosque

If you want to visit the interior you have to take off your shoes and the entrance is free, but there is nothing really to see there, unless you are muslim and you want to pray. It is far more interesting to walk around the building and admire its Gothic style.",Selimiye Mosque

50,First time I'd been in a Mosque. It was a rather strange experience to go into a building which had been so obviously a Christian church with arched windows and pillars but now put to a very different use. Calm peaceful atmosphere and good to just go in and sit for a while. Doors wide open and quite welcoming with no-one to control who goes in or out. Remember to remove your shoes and leave them at the entrance.,Selimiye Mosque

50,"A mandatory site visit. Of course, with due respect, thevisit to the mosque is something different and interesting to help understandthe historical context of this part of Cyprus. As a Christian I was struck by how the building was transformed from a cathedral to be now a mosque. That makes this place unique.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"The Selimye mosk is next door to the Buyuk Han and both should not be missed. The former Agia Sophia cathedral where the Lusignan rulers were crowned kings of Cyprus is still beautiful of course though when turned into a mosk in 1570 all sculptures, frescoes, stained glass windows and tombs were destroyed and the interior is white washed... It must have been stunning. No problem for visiting (very few people worshipping when we were there) provided you take off your shoes and are correctly dressed. There are a few tiny sculptures left on the portal and nearby another church has a beautiful door (but it was closed).",Selimiye Mosque
40,"Built as the gothic Cathedral of St. Sophia, it was converted to the Selimiye Mosque by the Ottomans in the 16th century.The original architecture is stunning, made to look somewhat strange on the outside by the addition of the obligatory minarets.The inside has been stripped long ago of all Christian symbolism to be replaced by the simplicity of a mosque, with mihrab, mimbar and large carpet covering the entire floor. It is a beautiful building inside, with the original windows, pillars and vaulted roof; a cool and airy refuge from the fierce Nicosia heat.As N. Cyprus is not a devout Moslem country, the mosque is normally almost devoid of worshippers, so one does not feel like an intruder.Immediately next door is the Bedestan, the (now unused) Greek Orthodox Cathedral, also worth a visit.",Selimiye Mosque

30,"The Selimiye Mosque is often shown in pictures of Nicosia, so it serves as the poster child for the city. You can view the city and the mosque from afar from the Ledra Museum-Observatory in Lefkosia (South Nicosia), which is a great way to get a visual idea of the separation of Nicosia. However, if you've been to other mosques in Turkey and throughout the Middle East, the Selimiye Mosque is under-whelming, especially inside. It's interior walls are painted white, so don't expect the Hagia Sophia. Close up, from the outside, it's hard to get the scale of the mosque because of its position close to other buildings. Nonetheless, the entrance is free, so you might as well go inside if there. However, if you happen to miss the Selimiye Mosque for whatever reason, don't feel too bad, as I feel that it's average at best and is better experienced from afar.",Selimiye Mosque
40,"This building dominates the skyline and is worth seeing. It starting life as a Christian church before being turned into a Mosque. It looks, from the outside, like any large old church that may be found dotted around the UK but with 2 minarets added draped in the Turkish flag. The inside is also worth seeing. It is set out as a Mosque but looking up towards the ceiling it still retains much of the look of a Christian church. Entry is free but a donation is expected. As is usual in such places visitors need to dress appropriately and shoes are left at the door.",Selimiye Mosque

50,"All the mosques I visited in both sides of Nicosia had been Greek Orthodox churches that had been converted to mosques in the past. The minaret towers were added and all Christian statues and crosses are long gone, Selimiye is particularly beautiful because of its size. It has two minarets that dominate the skyline that can be seen from both sides of the border. This is a place of worship so respect the signs of no entrance during prayer time. Otherwise, you can enter and walk around. You need to take off your shoes and you need to be dressed modestly (no shorts)",Selimiye Mosque
