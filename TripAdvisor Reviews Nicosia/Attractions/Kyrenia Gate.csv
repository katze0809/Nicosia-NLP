50,Place is not bad but it's disappointment because it is very Small and you can't see different or fantastic items.Only this gate's landscape is very nice exactly.Sea and mountain but I think you need to go in summer,Kyrenia Gate
40,"The North Nicosia Tourist Info Office is located inside of the Kyrenia Gate. Walking tours start here but when I asked about the free walking tour that they sponsored, the staff knew knothing about it. But they gave me a map and I took my own walking tour of North Nicosia",Kyrenia Gate
40,"The Kyrenia Gate (it may be noted as the Girne Gate) is one of three entrances which were built into the historic Venetian walls which enclosed the old City of Nicosia. It’s located in the northern part of walled quarter of Lefkoşa, the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia. The other two gates are the Paphos Gate at the western end of Lefkosia, and the Famagusta Gate at the eastern end of Lefkosia. I have reviewed each separately, as they all warrant a visit in their own right, for different reasons.It's a little squarish, squat construction, built between 1562 and 1567 from stones of the former medieval wall which the Venetian walls replaced. The little square tower on top, and the dome, were added in 1821. There's a stone panel on the building which records the date of its construction, and also a table inscribed with some verses from the Quran.It was a part of the continuim of the Venetian wall, until the British demolished sections of the wall around it in 1931 to facilitate the flow of traffic. What a shame, as the gate now stands isolated in the middle of a dual carriageway. The surrounding space has a number of significant statues, and is a bit of a focal point for gatherings and political rallies.Today, the gate is put to use as the Tourist Office of Nicosia Turkish Municipality. It was thus named as from this point the road led north-east up to Kryenia (now Girne).It's very pleasing to the eye, and looked beautifully grand in the afternoon sunlight, with the trees behind and the mountains beyond. It's certainly worth a visit if architecture and local history is of interest to you - that's why I went. If you are visiting Lefkoşa (the norther quarter of Nicosia) from the south, you'll need to head north from the Ledra Street Crossing, through Ataturk Square, and along Girne Caddesi to the gate. That's an easy 20 minute walk.I really appreciated this little corner of the history of Cyprus.",Kyrenia Gate
40,"Another old tourist attraction. No need to spend much time here but you can enjoy the nice restaurant near by, The Iskemleci.",Kyrenia Gate
20,The northern main entrance to Nicosia with its ancient Gate intact and preserved. Okay for a photo opportunity but nothing else,Kyrenia Gate
40,Having passed through the checkpoint Kyrenia gate is where you can pick up the buses to travel into the Turkish side of the island.The tourist information is inside the gate. There are a few restaurants near here serving local food.,Kyrenia Gate
40,"North Nicosia is in my view a more interesting place to visit than the south. To get to this gate we walked through a series of streets and lanes which showed us the other side of Nicosia. Buildings in disrepair, streets untrodden by tourists and an obvious lack of money. However the gate itself is beautiful as are the city walls. These are well preserved with a pretty municipal garden in the moat. Such s lot of history with that gate as well.",Kyrenia Gate
40,Situated in the Turkish side of Nicosia once you reach this monument you’ll feel like your in one of Turkey’s provinces 100% and that was a feeling I’ve loved. The building has a tourist information point and its well preserved. Minutes before you reach the gate on your right there’s a mevlana museum check it out.,Kyrenia Gate
40,"Situated in the North part of Nicosia, this Gate hosts the tourist info office. It's also from there that the buses to Kyrenia depart. We came from Nicosia South to see what it looked like but we did not like the neighborhood at all. It's dirty (the only place in Cyprus where we found that it wasn't clean), polluted and not very pleasant to walk through, in comparison with all the other parts of the city. That being said, the Gate itself is very well preserved and nice!",Kyrenia Gate
40,The gate is well preserved and houses the tourist information office. Buses to Girne/ Kyrenia depart from just outside here. The area around the gate is quite tatty but does feature some interesting old architecture. Suggested walks are marked with coloured lines on the streets....but some disappear en route!,Kyrenia Gate
40,Tourist information is located inside and once you pick up your free map you will find everything in easy walking distance including the border crossing,Kyrenia Gate
40,Tourist information is inside the gate! Takes a good pic! Make sure you wander round the area which is dilapidated but has character.,Kyrenia Gate

50,"This is one of gates of Nicosia when it was with in the Venetian walls. This was the gateway that lead to Kyrenia town. Now is more like a place for events, like concerts or exhibitions. A similar to Famagusta Gate.",Kyrenia Gate
40,"The Kyrenia gate is the gate at northern limits of the old city of Nicosia. Originally built by the Venetians, the Ottomans added an inscription to the gate lauding ""Allah as the Opener of Gates"".The gatehouse has been turned into a tourist information centre and very picturesque sitting on it's own in the middle of the road in between parts of the Venetian walls.",Kyrenia Gate
40,A pity that modern demands mean that this northern entrance into the city is no longer as impressive as it would have been but no less as interesting - now a useful focus point for buses to the north.,Kyrenia Gate
40,The Kyrenia Gate was part of the wall that surrounded the City now it is just the Tourist Information Office,Kyrenia Gate
50,Got the bus from Kyrenia to N Nicosia. Arrives and departs from just out side of Kyrenia Gate. By a nice café. Two lanes of traffic in and out of the city and the tourist information centre is on the centre island of the road. Café's and shop's are to be found just inside the city walls.It is only a short walk to the centre of the city. I have done the trip by car and by bus the best way is by bus.,Kyrenia Gate
50,"In 1878 the administration of the island was officially transferred to the British Empire. Nicosia became the colony's capital. During the British occupation Nicosia developed not only within the walls but also outside the historical centre. When the British took over Cyprus they entered Nicosia from the Kyrenia Gate. During the Ottoman period there were gate wardens. Horoz Ali (Ali, The Rooster) was the warden of the Kyrenia Gate and lived in the room on the second floor. Horoz Ali, was allowed by the new administration to carry on his duty of closing the doors at sunset and opening them after the morning Azan was recited. He continued his job until he died in 1946 at the age of 121. From then on the worn out doors of the Kyrenia Gate remained open at all times. In 1931 the walls on either side of the Kyrenia Gate were knocked down to create a road after one of Nicosia's first buses turned out to be too high to go through the original gate.",Kyrenia Gate

50,"Sitting in the centre of the road, just off one of the main roads it’s a well preserved greeting as you head into the town where you can cross the border.",Kyrenia Gate
40,"The old building stands in the middle of two lanes of traffic entering the city. You can imagine the many people in the past who have passed through here when it was one of a few ways of entering the old city. Bathed in sunlight, the stone glows. It is only small, but worth seeing as part of seeing the old walls. Inside is a good tourist info centre with many excellent leaflets in full colour, of the areas in Northern Cyprus - available in four languages.",Kyrenia Gate
30,"well preserved gateway, sitting on it's own in the middle of the road. may give an idea of the defences of the city.",Kyrenia Gate
40,"One of the three gates of the venetian walls this in the Turkish area. Set in the middle of a road island close to a statue of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. There are some cafe's nearby. From here you can catch coaches and Dolmus around northern Cyprus. Check the signs out on the Dolmus for their destinations. The gate itself is now an information ""booth"" rather than a gate in and out of Nicosia.",Kyrenia Gate

30,"Visited northern side of Nicosia, up past the Kryenia gate, including a little walk across the green line into southern Cyprus.Beautiful buildings and architecture... sadly some in desperate need of renovation.

30,"Small gate, now tourist office when it's open, not really a nice area, bit dirty and untidy, none of the restaurants looked worthwhile going into, but we did and didn't eat my food. Walked around most of shops empty, rubbish everywhere, not well kept at all. Disappointed",Kyrenia Gate
40,"Now used as a Tourist office it is situated in the middle of a busy road, so by careful getting to it. They do have a good map of the Turkish side of the town with all the main attractions clearly marked. Some of the museums close at 3pm as they are run by the military.",Kyrenia Gate
30,Seems like a tourist office !!! nice to see Islamic write ups which clearly mentioned the cross culture !!!worth for a walk !!!,Kyrenia Gate
30,I was told before I got there that there were free tours of the city done by volunteers. I was enthusiastic and looked forward to doing the city tour. The office was closed to I took my own tour on foot. It was exceedingly hot and I did not want to wait longer or go back. It was a very disappointing experience for me since I was only in Nicosia for the day.,Kyrenia Gate

30,"Get all you city free guides here,although you have to persist to ask the assistants whoseem to be not pushed to be in position of tourist personel,too occupied on computers.The building is superb,situated in centre of road entering old walls,NOTE Look from here a few yards ito city centre on left is,WHIRLING DERVISERS MUSEUM,well worth token entry fee,not well advertised ,this ancient sect still practises its traditional Hypnotic dance,so meditating ,transfixing ,clear your haed and meditate while the music plays.This order congregates in main land with huge groups of dancers,promoting the Dervise.",Kyrenia Gate

50,"One of the three original gates which divide Nicosia in two parts, Greek one and Turkish one. Impressive monument. Once you cross on the other side everything change, different language, different coin, different way to live. Turkish people do not speak English and is easy to understand they are less rich. Perhaps not may tourists crossing over, even because you need a passport and you must do a daily visa.",Kyrenia Gate

40,"The Kyrenia Gate is one of the Venetian walls' gates, the most known in the Turkish part of Nicosia. The attraction itself is not very big, now being used as an tourism information office. The architecture seems more Ottoman than Venetian, and the islamic inscriptions reminds every visitor abou the diversity of the city. Near the gate is a big statue of Kemal Ataturk and also the mini-buses (dolmuş) that connects Nicosia with Kyrenia (Girne) and Famagusta (Mağusa).",Kyrenia Gate
50,Gate is part of the history of the Country worth seeing and also worth seeing attractions in the locality as well,Kyrenia Gate

Just by the doorway, there are some steps leading to a viewing around on the first floor. Worth a look!Girne (Kyrenia) Gate is one of the three original gates in the North part of the City Walls built in the Venetian period, allowing entrance into Lefkosa. The gate was built in 1562 and named the Porta Del Proveditore after the Venetian military engineer Proveditore Francesco Barbaro. A small domed watchtower was added to the top of the gate in 1821. The gate has inscriptions from the Venetian and Ottoman periods on it's Walls. In 1931, during the British colonial period, sections of the wall on both sides were removed to allow for traffic movement.",Kyrenia Gate
