50,"I went on Cyprus national day big mistake in a way but in the other hand I was able to se the green line and now one around, the street was practically empty. Was able to get some interesting pictures.A must visit place definitely, be street smart at day or at night.",Ledras
40,"Great place to go to Northern Cyprus or vice versa! Actually you only show the pass in front and on the other side again and you are in a different country. Above all, I was very surprised that there is a completely different flair on the ""Turkish"" side. Make absolutely.",Ledras
40,"Due to covid19 the street was almost deserted and all shops, stores and restaurants closed. So calm and peaceful... normally is crowded mainly during the week end and unfortunately this time it was not !!",Ledras
40,"If you fancy a change of scenery it’s worth popping over for a day visit. The crossing doesn’t take long unless you happen to get stuck behind a bus load of tourists. You will need to show your passport on both sides and be aware of what you can bring back, they have a sign explaining this. You can pay with euros or local currency and most items are cheaper especially food.",Ledras
30,This is a pedestrian crossing point in Central Nicosia at the end of Ledra street. It is a functional place rather than a tourist attraction. When I visited at the end of Fen 2020 the place was closed due to Corona Virus.,Ledras
50,"The world’s last divided city, a must do when you are in Nicosia. There is no love list between the two sides, a map obtained in the southern side of the city does not have any markings of anything on the north side, and visa versa. I found the northern side more interesting but both sides of the old city are an enjoyable stroll. The northern side of the crossing seemed more through about our documents than the southern side.",Ledras
50,"You can see a wall, a big wagon and some army people. But you can still feel the tension between the 2 countries and it is easy for you to access to the North of you have a passport. Only will you feel like you left Europe for a different kind of countries if you go to the other border.",Ledras
30,This is not a tourist attraction but a symbol of division with the ‘green line’ separating the south and the occupied northern part of the island; and with Nicosia being the only divided capital city in the world and with this part of Ledra Street facilitating an easy crossing point between North and South Cyprus. There is actually really nothing more to say!!,Ledras
50,"The only remaining divided European Capital. Crossing the ""border"" is an historic and iconic experience that has to be done.It's very easy to pass and just have to show your ID or passport.",Ledras
20,"If I could advise you I would suggest you don’t bother to cross into the Turkish side at all it’s a waste of time,the whole area both Greek and Turkish are grimyHowever the historical interest may appeal to some and it’s always educationalThis is my second visit and it seems to have got worsePassports are necessary you have to present them twice, to the Greek authorities and then the TurkishThen the same coming back,surly passport office staff don’t make it any more pleasant",Ledras
30,"Once popular place in Nicosia, now, is crossing point, only by foot, between Greek and Turkish part of the capitol of Cyprus. Surrounding buildings in the buffer zone are still deserted and partly ruined as speechless witnesses of clashes that has happened few decades ago. Passports are obligatory here, clerks are very polite at the both sides and there very few people crossing at this checkpoint. If you want to visit Turkish part as a tourist, like we did, I recommend you to cross the green line in the center of the Old bazaar of Nicosia.",Ledras
40,"First of all: don't forget your passport! Now, in low season, we didn't have to wait very long to cross from the Greek to the Turkish part (and back). Once we arrived in the Turkisch part, we noticed the stores with fake items. Be careful with this as it is illegal to bring them to the Greek part.On the Turkish side there are a lot of interesting buildings to see, like a church that was changed into a mosque or the buyuk han and other buildings. Take your time to stroll around.",Ledras
50,"Due to unfortunate events, the island and its capital are divided, but the pedestrian crossing in Ledras street is very decent. No delays and easy crossing on both sides.DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSPORTS.",Ledras
40,"Packed. Great coffee and cakes. Full of locals. It feels a bit tense being on the crossing point to trnc, which is a sore issue for the Greek side, yet here we are with all these locals. I like it.",Ledras
30,"Ledra Street Crossing is a gateway between two cultures. One side Greek Cyp riot and the other Turkish. Have your passport and don't fear for it is easy to circumvent. A word of warning for travelers is that the Greek side will check your purchases and confescate what you buy if they determine them counterfeit. The Turkish side is friendly with many opportunities for good buys, I am not a professional buyer and do not determine fashion wars but look at the quality of merchandise. Trust me there are bargains on the Turkish side. Always though when purchasing to not over due it and draw attention to your spoils. You are safe on either side. One highlight on the Turkish side is the Turkish ice creme man. He is funny and delightful. He alone is worth the trip. Nice restaurants are plentiful on both sides. I recommend at least four hours and have fun in Buyuk Han.",Ledras
50,If visiting Nicosia - this a quick and easy pedestrian crossing between the North and South of the island,Ledras
40,Very quick and easy to pass back and forth. We crossed 3 times and had to wait 5 minutes once. You need your passport,Ledras
40,"I travelled here for the day from Paphos and attempted to cross the border but forgot my passport. Apart from that, it seemed pretty simple for those who were prepared to get across the border. The crossing itself was not too busy and people were moving along nicely.On a note of caution, some of the car park attendants in Nicosia are a bit cheeky. Most charged €3 for the day but the gentleman who took my money tried to get €3 per hour. He was politely advised where to go.",Ledras
50,Very easy to walk across and a pleasure to wander around the old town. Very quiet and peaceful. had a nice Turkish lunch in a courtyard. You can pay in euros for most things and prices are reasoanble. Just a pity that the city is divided.,Ledras
30,"We wondered if it is easy for Australians to cross the border - the answer is that it is. You need a passport but it is fairly laidback. Inside the Turkish quarter the mosque is very close and interesting - (dress politely). There are many markets inside the Turkish sector with clothes, shoes, rugs, etc. Bring small denomination Euro as 50 euro notes are not easy to change. We only moved around a kilometre from the crossing. Greek Nicosia is nothing spectacular to see if you have been in other European centres",Ledras
40,"I'm an American. Per the USA State Department I could not cross here. I could fly into the Turkish side and fly out and then fly into the Greek side.It took be less than 5 minutes to move across the Green Line. When I ask souvenir shop owners about North Nicosia & South Nicosia souvenirs. Both sides stated this is ""Cyprus"".",Ledras
40,Crossed over today from Cyprus to the Occupied NorthI must say Both the Turkish and the Cypriot checkpoints have very bad attitudesIt's well worth a visit and is very safe.Check what you are allowed to bring back as the Cypriot Guards take pleasure in seizing items purchased,Ledras
40,It's a bad feeling to see the island cutting in half and the Cypriots separate in two countries . The passing was fast and with no delays,Ledras
40,"I visited as part of an organised day trip to Nicosia. It was quite surreal walking along a pedestrianised shopping street into a border crossing. The actual crossing took less than ten minutes and stepping through to the Turkish area was a totally different culture.The history is sad but, for me, it was a unique chance to visit the World's last divided Capital.Don't forget your passport!",Ledras
40,"Was in Nicosia for the Cyprus v Scotland football match, and had a few hours to kill, and for months I decided that I would cross the border from Cyprus into northern Nicosia and the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Turkey"".This is the only crossing point in the city that I am aware of, and all in all pretty easy to get across, and unlike in Turkey, no visa is required or payment.Main thing to remember though is that A VALID PASSPORT IS A MUST!!!!! As no passport, no crossing!When on the Cyprus side, I was just waved through before I had even got my passport out, then when in ""no mans land"" which is effectively a wooden shed making up a tunnel that takes you to the Turkish side, you will wait a good 10 minutes, as they do check your passport (though do not stamp it, they put your details into the computer).Pretty surreal, as for only a few yards, the difference is night and day! On the Greek Cyprus Side its pretty much the feel of the rest of Cyprus, but as soon as you pass the Turkish passport check, you suddenly get a VERY Turkish feel to the place.Seems to be that getting from Cyprus to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus takes a lot longer than on the way back, as did the return journey in just a minute or so.All in all, not as off putting as it may sound/look, and the northern quarter does have a nice charm to it and good to walk around.Watch out for customs on the way back, as I heard stories at the football match later in the day of people getting stung for import tax for taking cigarettes across the border.",Ledras
40,"If you are in Nicosia, take your passport and cross this border. It's so odd to see a town 'cut in half' but historically it is so important. Don't be obvious with photos and none of the actual.passport area - you wouldn't in an airport! But visit just to see the area and of course to visit the Turkish area and the markets there (the.original market housed in the 1939 building is the best)",Ledras
50,"If you want to enter the north side of Nicosia, this is a very easy trip to make. There are two checkpoints, firstly through the Greek side and then the Turkish side. You need a passport or ID card. It is very simple and straightforward and people travel backwards and forwards all the time.I loved seeing both sides of the city and visiting the many interesting archaeological sites on both sides. They both have very different vibes, but at all times, it feels very safe.",Ledras
50,A hard line that separated an island and life.. Strange feelings because it reminds you of a war and a sudden diversion of lives... I met people that they live at the greek side and they see their parents house at the other side.. occupied... All this depression reminds you the war.. already 50 years after... 😢,Ledras
40,Staying in Paphos took a trip to Nicosia.it was busy but no queues.ledra street easy to find. Lovely area.crossed at boarder very quickly. You can feel the difference. It's weird and error.had a wander around the old bizzare which is lovely.A very enjoyable day.Worth the trip,Ledras
50,"My wife and I visited Nicosia (Lefkosa) on our recent visit to Cyprus. We are staying on the south, Greek, side of Cyprus and decided to visit the Ledra crossing and enter the Turkish side of the city.The crossing was smooth and trouble free (provided you remember your passports) and it is bizarre to see 2 different cultures operating as neighbours just a few metres apart. The Greek side is a typical western European city with all the familiar names and coffee shops; cross a few metres into the Turkish side and you are in a typical middle Eastern bazaar experience.Both are delightful in their own way but the contrast between 2 cultures is striking and well worth the visit.",Ledras
50,"This is why we went to Nicosia. Wanted to see what's on the other side of this strange border crossing. Close to my imagination, it was like walking 100 meters and suddenly being in a new country. Passport control on both sides, but went quite quick. They hardly looked at the passport on both sides, so I guess the tension has loosened up over the years. Should see this if you're in Cyprus. If you're smarter than me, check out the observation deck on Ledra Street (same building as H&M) before crossing. You'll get a better overview then. Turkish side is a bit cluttered.",Ledras
50,Transition from Cyprus into the occupied North. See the UN buffer zone in all its eerie glory. A deeply interesting and strange place. Soldiers from the Cyprus defence forces face off 24/7 against Turkish troops in the Turkish named “Northern Cyprus” which is only acknowledged by Turkey. An illegal occupation to many. A perpetual standoff. Check Wikipedia for the history then see it for yourself. A serious and dangerous tinder box kept safe by the UN. The buffer zone is exactly as it was in 1974 during the invasion. People literally upped and left whatever they were doing at that second. There are cars from 1974 still in the showroom with no mileage on them. Food on plates. Shops left to dust as they were that very day. Massively interesting. Worth a look if it’s your thing.,Ledras
50,Ledra street crossing is very simple. Staff at both sides at were very kind and cooperative. No stamping of passport or any paper any more. They just use scanning machine for passports. A worthy experience of through a lively street at night time.,Ledras
30,"Getting to the other side and back is not much of a deal if you have your credentials, but once you're there, you'll be under the impression that time stood still. You'll find the well known atmosphere of a Turkish bazaar and most probably everything would seem cheaper than in Cyprus, fake articles or not, but food and drink surely are. After you strolled down the streets of North Nicosia and touched the few points of interest, you might wanna try the Spanish or Italian cuisine at the Sabor Restaurant, behind Selimiye Camii Mosque, in a friendly atmosphere with helpful waiters.",Ledras
50,A crossing place separating 2 nations from uniting. Both Cypriot greeks and turks need to pass by to their own land. It gets a bit of que but worths the trouble doing it. Same people smiling and friendly same race different background turks or greeks one land,Ledras
30,"...the officers are not very polite nor engaging and the time to get through is long. The highlight? When we got to Turkish side, waiting for rest of the party to get through - along walked a man with a banana to his ear and speaking as though on a mobile phone. You couldn't make it up. On the left on Turkish side is a great ice cream parlour/ coffee shop well worth a visit.",Ledras
50,"Interesting way to visit Turkish Cyprus. The border is right in the middle of the city . You must remember to take your passport with you or you won’t be able to cross . On the other side is a shopping district. Small shops selling fake designer clothes, shoes and other fake items. Don’t be taken in by the cheep prices. Interesting place to visit.",Ledras
40,"Bring your passport - it will be scanned by Greek and Turkish Cypriot guards each time. Queues can build in the early morning and when tour groups arrive, but never more that five minutes",Ledras
40,"a must do when in the city, we did the over and back tripits sad that this diversion is still there.there is not mush to see, i wish there where some info a site",Ledras
30,"as the last divided capital in the world, crossing the UN zone and moving into the turkish occupied part is a unique and special experience",Ledras
50,A must do & visit while passing by Nicosia!!! Crossing the Border into the Turkish Occupied side is an incredible experience!!! Very sad reality of modern history!!!,Ledras
40,Usually quick and efficient ....apparently avoid lunch time as some staff go for lunch so there aren't so many kiosks open.On the way to the Turkish officials there has been a wooden structure built recently to keep the sun off the queue...very thoughtful! On Friday we were all queuing patiently...lunchtime!...when a German man decided he wasn't going to queue. He just marched to the front and pushed in...I stepped forward and told him of the queue. He was extremely rude and shouted. I admit I shouted back ....when he put his passport on the shelf the Turkish passport control guy sent him to the back of the queue.....brilliant work that man!,Ledras
30,"The green line between Greek Cyprus and the occupied north is very small here, just a few empty houses, and the passing is easy. However it makes you very sad to see the poor northern part of the city, and the fake stuff that is sold there. Nicosia could have been a beautiful capital. now it is a reminder of the poor mental state of the invaders.",Ledras
40,"We were at the crossing point on a Sunday afternoon in August and there were no queues at all. We parked outside Pafos gate and walked to Ledra St,as the streets are very narrow and often one way. It was a 10 minute walk to Ledra St and then we crossed over very quickly. The shopping on the Turkish side is very good and we were pleasantly surprised. They accepted Euros ,credit cards or Turkish Lira. If we would have known how nice it was we would have given ourselves more time to explore.",Ledras
30,"This is just a border crossing... I mean, it’s interesting to see the dead zone - but it is just a passport control so... unless you’re crossing into North Cyprus, it’s not like a “tourist site”.",Ledras
30,"Ledra Street crossing point is nothing special, only the means of cross from the Greek side of Cyprus to the Turkish side. But it a must if you are in Nicosia. You need your passport.",Ledras
40,"This is such an emotive and hugely symbolic spot in the divided city of Nicosia - the world’s only remaining divided capital city. And regardless of your views on the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus, it’s highly likely that you will use the Ledra Street Crossing if you are going to visit Lefkoşa (the Turkish occupied northern section of Nicosia) from the southern section of Nicosia (Lefkosia). It’s one of a small number of official border posts between the Republic of Cyprus and the internationally unrecognised state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. And whilst it is a physical ‘border’, the cultural divide is as big as the concrete barricades you’ll see in the vicinity.The Ledra Street Crossing is pedestrian only, and is located at the northern end of Ledra Street in Lefkosia. There’s a curious sculpture in the middle of the street just by the crossing point. You’ll certainly notice the barricades, immigration booths, and armed officers. The crossing into the north is relatively straight forward since it was opened up in 2008 (apparently to promote unity), and will be very quick if there are no queues. Here’s a couple of things to keep in mind:1. You’ll need your passport; EU citizens and some other countries do not need a visa, and if a visa is needed because of your nationally you will complete the form at the crossing.2. For EU citizens your passport will usually be read twice (but not stamped), at the Cypriot booth and again (a little further on) at the Turkish booth. You are then in the north and can proceed into Lefkoşa.3. Do not take photographs anywhere at the crossing, including within the boarded-up 30 metre stretch of the UN buffer zone.4. Be polite, and keep pleasantries to a formal minimum.5. On the return to the south, your passport will again be read at both immigration points, and any bags (especially bags of goods you may have purchased in ) will be Lefkoşa. There may be queues at the crossing at peak morning and evening times.6. If you are on a short day visit there’s no need to obtain Turkish Lira; Euros are wildly accepted in Lefkoşa.",Ledras
30,"The crossing facilities are pretty basic, and fairly slow. The Northern checkpoint has parasols for some shade at least (37 degrees out there). For a ""non boarder"", both sides a bit officious. Almost like they don't want to be there.",Ledras
10,To appreciate the feelings you must realise that Berlin still exist here. Foreigners in our own country 🙁,Ledras
30,People were working in the neutral zone. Lots of rubish but friendly policemen. I hope north Cyprus stays out of EU!,Ledras
50,"You could be walking on a pedestrian mall and without realizing you would be at this crossing point. The Turkish and Greek 'booths' are less than 100 meters apart. I call them booths as they don't look like permanent buildings but temporary modular huts or booths...Just show your documents and walk to the next stop, and you have crossed from the North to the South or vice versa. As far as I noticed, just for pedestrians but I read that UN and diplomatic vehicles use this checkpoint as well.",Ledras
50,"Have an amazing walking tour of 4h in both sides of Nicosia within the walls with guiding in English, German and greek offered by licensed tourist guid (tel 99212906)",Ledras
40,"If you don't pay attention, you might even walk the street without noticing there's a passport control there. You would cross the ""border"" in less than a minute.",Ledras
50,We got there to see the divided capital of Cyprus. The passport procedure seems to be only of formality as the officers hardly look at you. You show your passport first at the one side passing away from and secondly to the side you arrive on. Try it as it is an interesting place. Also see the streets blocked with barbed wire and some places also military people.,Ledras
40,"Always feels strange having to show your passport to enter another part of Cyprus. Have to say the ‘service’ from the Greek side has always been more friendly when showing the passport, whether that’s just the four times I have crossed or not I don’t know but my passport was just slapped down on the other side with not a word said.",Ledras
50,The crossing is at the far end of Ledra Street. You show your passport to both Greek and Turkish authorities both ways. When we went there was no waiting time. As Nicosia is the only divided city you really have to cross “The Green Line” when visiting. After crossing there are many restaurants and interesting buildings to look at and people we met were extremely friendly. Adjoining streets are blocked with oil drums! A strange situation.,Ledras
40,Staying in the North we had a day out by shared bus to Lefkosa from Kyrenia. 32TRY for two both ways so good start. It was very hot 40C but took our time on a walking tour which brought us to the crossing. Very efficient both sides with a quick check of passports. Interesting to cross the green line where time has stood still. Also interesting to compare the commercial Euro south with the more traditional Turkish North.,Ledras
50,Crossing the border is the ledra check point is very fast and simple. On neither sides they stepmed our passports.,Ledras
20,Not a lot to say here. It's simply a military controlled crossing from Northern Cyprus into the Greek controlled side which has pedestrianised street with UK high street type shops.,Ledras
10,"Its a Check point dividing Nicosia after the Turkish invasion in 1974.To the Turkish occupied land you only see soldiers and policemen everywhere they are 45 years back, everything as left by the Greek Cypriots in 1974.",Ledras
50,"In the middle of an once undivided shopping street , there is a crossing point between the Greek Niocosia part and the Turkish area. The crossing procedure is quite easy...you have to show your passport , or -if you EU member country's citizen , your ID- to one of the officials sitting in a container-like offices placed on both side , and after a basic doc check you are allowed to go or come..Before my visit there , I was told, that I., one can not cross with EU issued ID ( prooved to be false ....I'am Hungarian, and I could ) and II ., that no any goods bought on the Turkish part will be permitted to import back to Cyprus ( I could not see any such investigation while coming back, despite some people were carrying some paper bags )",Ledras
40,"We crossed it in the morning around 9.30 AM on Friday and there was no queue, but on our way back around noon there were more people at the both sides. Still it took less than 5 min.",Ledras
30,"If I didn't have a 230 eur speeding fine waiting for me, I would have walked over many times.I've been to the other side so I know what to expect... I just don't know why they want to make it so difficult.",Ledras
50,This is an amazing city and it has a fascinating history. The people are very friendly and proud of their heritage. The food is healthy and very tasty.,Ledras
50,It's very interesting experience.Must see. Does not take very long.. Turkey to Europe or other way..,Ledras
40,This is a border crossing from Cyprus to Turkey in the northern part of the Cyprus that is owned by Turkey. The border had no signage and it's the simplest crossing I've ever seen.,Ledras
50,"This street is full of shops, restaurants, cafes and life. It ends with the borders to Turkish Cyprus. I really like the place and would recommend visiting it!",Ledras
20,"This is really not a must do. It is just a boarder point. The facts are interesting, but to see it is not all that.",Ledras
40,"Walking down the main pedestrian shopping street in Nicosia, you pass through the Cypriot checkpoint and then the more formal Turkish one.. if you have your passport then worth the visit as many of the fabulous old buildings are on the Turkish side.Its a simple crossing point for walkers only.Some queues to be expected on the Turkish control.",Ledras
10,We thought it would be more authentic ... the „Basar“ on the other side is ... meeeh ... it’s not worth it to go. Only if you want to see the difference from Europe to turkey,Ledras
50,Crossed over to North Nicosia today. The crossing was uncomplicated - passports are checked on both sides within a feW minutes.Worlds of differences from one side to the other. Desirable to read up on the island’s complicated history to comprehend the situation.Interesting historical sites to see as well as disturbing edifices abandoned and/or disintegrating.,Ledras
40,"Nicosia is now Europe's only divided city and as such, the crossing point between North and South Cyprus is certainly of interest. It is now possible for tourists to cross from one side to the other if they so wish, by obtaining a special document at the gateway.",Ledras
10,Nicosia is the only capital city still divided in the 21 century and this crossing point can’t make it more obvious and more depressing for both sides of the devide.Yes it is simple to go across but why do people think it’s a tourist attraction.Go 100 meters to the left and you see an armed soldier standing guard or 100 to the right and see people having a coffee at the next corner with their backs towards barricades and sand bags 3meters high!Depressing if not worse.,Ledras
50,The Turkish side is so much cheaper to shop on and the people are friendly we are going back in November loved the ice cream man here ❤️ this year I am bringing two of my older children and my new baby under 1!!,Ledras
50,"Entering / exiting into either side of Nicosia through the Ledra Street Crossing Point was very easy and efficient. Most people were made to show their passports, but some locals that seemed to be known to the officials just passed through with a smile. It wasn't intimidating at all and I felt very welcome on both sides.",Ledras
40,"A very interesting place which offers a unique experience, the crossing itself goes very fast and hassle free.",Ledras
30,"It seems so, none of the sides are taking seriously who is crossing and why. They check the passports but it is just a painfull turist atraction,",Ledras
10,"It' a ""crossing point|"" to the occupied by Turkish army since 1974 of Nicosia , the only divided capital of Europe. Although many people, including me, are crossing frequently this point because the friendship and the need to leave all together in a such small island it's bigger from politicians or army....",Ledras
40,"Not sure how to rate the crossing point. For me it is sad that it still exists. However, for those who want to cross is like going to another country within seconds. You have to show your id before crossing. On the other side it is totally different life: another currency, another language but similar food. The north side also has many sites to visit.",Ledras
50,"The Turkish side of Nicosia is so much better, authentic, nice to see ZERO corporate eating places! It’s worth a visit In Nicosia So interesting fake goods yes of course, but I saw fake goods in Greek Cyprus too, they only reason why fake goods are sold because people buy it.Both native people(s) look identical however much they try not to admit it and bury their heads in the sand, both people are friendly. Nicosia in Turkish side was more authentic experience of Cyprus! Greek side it was as though it’s in Europe! Cyprus is in the Middle East it near Jordan and Egypt and other middle eastern countries! The EU showing it as though it’s In Europe is the biggest joke! Also there is an UK army base there which isn’t advertised. Cyprus was used as a tax haven for many years by Europeans... including the UK... allegedly",Ledras
40,"This marks the entrance to North Cyprus, aka the Turkish part of the island. Crossing over is straightforward as you need to just show them your passport, and that's it. However, the area is one relatively small street that takes you past a lot of unremarkable shops and restaurants. At most, you'll likely spend 30 minutes here to say you've traveled to an unrecognized territory.",Ledras
40,"Well worth crossing into the Turkish side, passports are needed but it’s quick and easy. Once across everything is Turkish and the currency changes to Turkish lira but euros are accepted in some places",Ledras
30,Very touristy. Nice cafes and very friendly people. Off the main streets the poverty is visible. Make your way to Salimiye Square and buy Turkish sweets and assorted nuts,Ledras
40,"Hassle free crossing from North to South and vice versa. Guards are friendly and low key. Lots of shopping on both sides. Typical tourist restaurants and shops. The North side has counterfeit clothing,bags,shoes in most shops and many gold and jewelry shops.",Ledras
30,"The place is close to the border. Is interesting to see it but in the same time is very curious to see a city splited in two parts, and parts of it remained without any activity, abandoned.",Ledras
40,Well worth a visit if in the area. Lots of interesting streets off the side areas. Pedestrianised. No long delays at the crossing into the occupied area. Bring your passport.,Ledras
30,"this is just a passport checkpoint. This place maybe sensitive for local, especially those who concern about the Turkish occupancy.",Ledras
30,"I was strolling with my Cypriot friend down Ledra street, with nice shops and coffee houses and we came to this crossing point which people were passing rapidly showing their passports and we could see the same street that continues in the other 'occupied"" side. I did not cross it...",Ledras
30,Not what I expected. The border crossing consists of a few passport kiosks and a 20yd no man's land separating them. The Turkish side just full of shops selling fake rubbish.,Ledras
40,"I was in 6 february 2019, easy to pass, no line, passport and in 1minute you pass. Thera are 2 Chek point filter",Ledras
50,A street divided by tape and two kiosks where you show your passport. Took 2 minutes to cross to another country.,Ledras
50,Street for shopping clothes and everything you want suitable for everything.you will find many options for eating a drink. Day and night. You can just walk and relax. You will also find many options for coffee with friends or with the family,Ledras
40,"The Ledra Street crossing was a fascinating, but in many ways sad, experience. Crossing it was straightforward but passports were required. Unlike many of the other reviewers I thought that the Turkish side was nicer than the Greek side, where we were staying. Certainly Ledra Street looked very modern, but stray just off it and ma y of the building g's had gone to rack and ruin. By contrast, the Turkish side had many small shops and restaurants which seemed to be doing a roaring trade. This was not the review I expected to write but it is how I saw it. One more small thing, the limit of cigarettes that can be brought hback to Cyprus from the TRNC is 40 and not 200 as you might expect.",Ledras
50,"A very interesting compare-and-contrast walk around the North Old City. Stuck in time since 1974 it seems, whereas the South has moved on. North aslo visibly much poorer than the South, although the very old historical buildings still in reasonable repair (the old market, the administrative buildings like Post Office, mausoleum, etc).",Ledras
10,This is one of the 3 gates that separetes the last divided capital on the earth . U can cross the border from non recognized country to the EU with just showing ur id!,Ledras
40,Crossing from Greek south Cyprus to the Turkish controlled North Cyprus as a pedestrian at Ledra Street is pretty painless and easy nowadays. Take your passport! Something worth experiencing. There can be queues in summer.,Ledras
40,"This is the main crossing point by foot from Ledra street. You do need to make sure you have your passport with you - it will not be stamped - while crossing between the 2 parts. There is a small no mans land in between the crossing. Not sure if with an EU ID card crossing is allowed, but for those with what seems to be a Cyprus or Turkish ID card you can also do the crossing. Lines are not too long. Over on the Turkish side, you have quite a number of places selling items which are also priced in Euro's. If you have Turkish lira's you can use them too. Prices for restaurant seems to be more or less the same on both sides.",Ledras
50,If ever you get a chance come visit this joke nobody wants to call it a border but everyone must show I.d and if you dare but call it a border you will be lectured or maybe even taken aside for the remark so come and call this a border and enjoy the biggest joke of the island.,Ledras
40,"Take your passport, have to show on Cypriot and Turkish side. Restaurants and fake goods ,some wool shops, Walk a bit outside of that area and you the devastationLeft from 1974, shame.",Ledras
50,"Experiencing crossing the border, and seeing and feeling the differences between two sides is a must.No problem with crossing (Did it multiple times) - just have a valid passport with you to show it twice (both Greek and Turkish side).I find Turkish side much cheaper and interesting - with much, much better food!",Ledras
30,This was the first time for me but also the first time for my family crossing into occupied territory. Im glad we did it even though it was heartbreaking for some.,Ledras
50,Lots of nice shops here. Crossing is easy. A must visit. Would highly recommend AAA. lots of places to eat and drink.,Ledras
30,Interesting crossing point from the greek Nicosia to the Turkish occupied territory of the north. Must present passports to cross back and forth since there is a tight control. A UN buffer zone keeps both sides separated.,Ledras
50,Have passed here several times because we stay at an AirBnb apartment on Ledra Street that is very close to the crossing point. It’s easy to go through the police control with an EU passport. The restaurants in North Nicosia are cheaper.,Ledras
50,What a “strange” place to write a review of. It was interesting and emotional especially as we have friends affected by the invasion. The crossing is all good but you need ID or a passport. Advisable to go early as the queue by around lunch time was crazy. We crossed about 0900 and walked strait through.,Ledras
50,"If you carry a valid passport or ID card, it is very easy to cross from the Greek to the Turkish part of Nicosia at Ledra Street. Minimum of formalities, and no pressure of any kind. Well worth the experience, sad that a formal crossing point is still necessary.",Ledras
40,"The streets around still have concrete barricades as reminders of the war of 74.Ledra street is the only pedestrian-only border crossing point between North and South Cyprus. It is a real international border between two countries and formalities must be observed as at any international border - no sunglasses, hats, phones or cameras when presenting your passport which will be checked but no longer stamped, neither do you need a Turkish visa. Between the two passport and police checkpoints is no-mans-land all boarded up since 1974, please walk on the left-hand side of the path, there is a dividing line.All sounds like a remnant from the cold war, but it is real as is the difference between north and south although I have a suspicion that the immediate part of the north is deliberately tatty as you only have to walk a few hundred meters away from the tourist zone to find somewhere more palatable. Think haves and have-nots of any city.",Ledras
30,Ledra Street is the modern type checkpoint Charlie crossing from the Greek Cypriot to the Turkish Cypriot side of Nicosia.The border post officials are totally disinterested on their function and it seems to be automated without a smile or acknowledged greeting. The difference between the 2 sides is quite remarkable though. Is this religious or cultural?? You decide on that!,Ledras
40,"Its incredibly easy to cross between the borders and on both sides there is nothing to be alarmed by as a tourist. The checks take no more than a few minutes and when you look at the street both sides look pretty identical and you only really notice a difference in the North once you have gone beyond the eyeline. People all seemed friendly enough, they are just struggling under the collapse of the lira - makes things very cheap though.",Ledras
50,"If you want to see UN peacekeepers with blue berets, experience the reality of the world's only divided capital city and see the Northern side of Nicosia then this is the way to do it. Our children were fascinated by walking through ""no man's land"" and trying to understand why there were checks on each side. The Northern side is worth a visit, a different feel and incredibly friendly people. Great deals to be had in the market and surrounding streets too.",Ledras
10,"Went past the border crossing felt very quiet sad and down , I wish and hope for peace one day one day very soon !!!!For me my wife and childrenMr Constantinou in hope !!!!!",Ledras
30,Crossing from Greek Cyprus into Tukish north Nicosia.The Turkish invasion in 1974 seized Northern Cyprus which remains under Turkish control (illegally).UN troops still maintain the border which separates the two factions.,Ledras
30,the installation is mildly interesting and marks the entrance to the crossing point. wouldn't go out of my way to see it.,Ledras
30,"We are staying in the north so came on a free tour.So we had the background from a local north Cypriot guide and I can’t understand why in 2018 there is Still a need for this.Going in to Cyprus is fine however don’t try taking any ‘copies’ or fake goods across they search your bags.Coming back into northern Cyprus was a ball ache was 45mins and a real unnecessary chore.The difference between north and south is very clear, and something worth experiencing",Ledras
30,"Be aware that on the Greek side there are no sign posts to help find the crossing. There may be a short delay processing through Turkish customs but no more than a few minutes. Some great little cafés, bars & restaurants offering choice, good value & friendly welcome. They are happy to take euro as currency.",Ledras
30,"This is a weird crossing, you cross from one side to the other of Nicosia along perhaps a 100 metre ""no mans land"". You have to queue and the Greek Cypriot's are far from pleased that you are going to the North but is worth the effort as the Northern Turkish quarter as it's delightful.",Ledras
50,"took a coach trip to the cypriot side of ledra st and decided to walk across, was a bit freaky going across no mans land and when we got over to the turkish side was like going through a time warp, great experiance highly reccomend it",Ledras
40,It was an interesting visit as you get to see two cultures in one place. It can get busy at times butnif you are in Nicosia you should visit this area.,Ledras
40,This is a forgotten border monitored by the UN . Crazy that this city is divided . We found North Nicosia much more interesting than the South,Ledras
50,Ledra street is the hub of the old city with streets and alleyways leading to all areas.Start here if you wish to explore. Also a crossing point to the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia. Bring your passport if you wish to cross over.Lots of old and modern shops. Plenty of eating places. We prefer to find some of the quieter restaurants in the side streets.Viewing area on floor 11 of H&M building for Panorama and helpful exhibition of history of Nicosia including multi language video,Ledras
20,"I arrived in Cyprus from the Turkish side and used Ledra Crossing to go to the Greek side and leave the Contry from that side.At Ledra Crossing my passport was not stamped so I asked the officer for the stamp since I will be leaving the country from the airport in Larnaca, his response was that I do not need it and it if fine. Well it was not fine because his colleagues at the airport were asking for that stamp and I was put aside to wait while they checked if I entered the country from there or not. So be careful if you are in similar situation as I was.",Ledras
50,"Nice place in Nicosia, pedestrians street. With a lot of shops and at the end there is this crossing point where you can visit divided capital’s Turkish part. There will be needed passport to be checked at CY part, and as well at Turkish partWorth to visit",Ledras
30,"It would look like just another wierd border crossing to those unaware of its history. We were following the green line to discover abandoned and ruined properties, walls, barb wires and watchtowers. Quirky and sad.",Ledras
40,This pedestrian area is actually a border between the two communities in Cyprus. Passing from the south to the north and vise versa offers the opportunity to meet the diifencece between the people of the city,Ledras
40,"We visited Cyprus and took the opportunity to cross border by walking in Nikosia. To go from Greece to Turkey is easy - however it leaves you with a wired feeling. On both sites are stores, restaurants, tourists. But than you realize that this are definitely to countries. It’s the small things that make the difference. The demilitarized zone in between. Not very big at Ledra street - abandoned buildings, testimonies of a past where the country was not divided. Strolling cats who do not care on which side they bag for food...",Ledras
40,"Even the Cypriot part did it quickly, the other part made a long queue until we could enter. I recommend passing to the other side.",Ledras
30,"take your passport, and walk into the turkish-cypriot side of Nicosia. Crossing took 1 minute.there is lots to see on the turkish side.the border officials on the greek side were quite unfriendly I have to say.",Ledras
50,"The crossing into the Turkish sector was really quite simple. Present your passport at the window, walk about 50 yards through the UN Area, present your passport to the Turkish officials and you on you way. Returning was even easier....no line.",Ledras
40,"This is the border between Turkish and Cyprus where you can cross to turkish side , need passport to pass , and once u pass u can find many Turkish shops and restaurantsGood time to spend",Ledras
30,"After all the hype, I think I expected barbed wire and machine gun posts, I have never seen a more open and humane border crossing in my life",Ledras
50,While visiting Ledra st we stayed at the ASTY HOTEL.The management went above and beyond the course of duty to make us feel welcome.Fantastic place more than highly recommended,Ledras
50,As you reach the crossing point along Ledra street you’ll feel overwhelmed and amazed. The amazement comes from the fact that feets away you’ll be in the Turkish side of the island. Its as if your visiting two countries at a time. Both sides are incredible to be honest. Once you’ve reached at the crossing point you’ll have to pass through two checkpoints while having your passport. One is the greek Cypriots officers and the other are the Turkish Cypriots officers. Its free to pass and just make sure that your passport does not need pre approval visa as to enter the Turkish side.,Ledras
50,"Easy to cross, just need to show your passport! Interesting place to visit especially no mans land, no photos allowed though!Defo worth doing if you are in the area",Ledras
40,"At least, to experience the difference in cultures & the shapes of the streets once you cross the point.. also, there are many little shops with very nice goods in the Turkish side , but you have to discuss the price a lot with the sellers.. in the side of Greek Cyprus , you will find a newer style for the shops.. each has its spirit & they both deserve the visit",Ledras
40,"It was a very interesting day, we parked our car in a car park on the Cypriot side, and crossed the borders on foot to the Turkish side. The area is Turkish side of Nicosia, and as you take a stroll down the Main Street you will notice the Turkish flag everywhere and the locals speak in pure Turkish, it is rich with traditional Turkish shops and restaurants. I would visit again if I have the chance.",Ledras
30,Crossing the boarder was relatively easy and quick. I have to say that I was expecting a little more to do on the other side. Plenty of shops with fake branded goods and a few restaurants but not much else. The baths were closed and looked like the had been for some time. Didn’t spend long there.,Ledras
30,"This is the probably the quickest way to cross the UN buffer zone, but not the most interesting. For that, you need to cross via the Ledra Palace, towards the West of the city.The crossing does, however, provide a visual contrast between the 2 parts of this divided city. There are lots of interesting historical buildings to note and visit on both sides. The southern section has the multinational brands one associates with wealth; the northern section doesn't.",Ledras
30,here is the place to cross to Turkish occupied Cyprus. The officials in both sides are good and cooperative,Ledras
40,A noticeable difference when you cross the pedestrian border between TRNC and Cyprus. The retail outlets in the Greek side of Nicosia feature recognisable high street brands and shop names. The shops in the Turkish end of Ledra Street sell knock-off goods and copies. Just beware that customs could seize any fake items you try to bring back into the south.,Ledras
50,"We parked the car less than 100m from the Ledra palace and crossed there, walking down through no mans land of the green zone, past many abandoned buildings before entering the south and walking down past the usual shops you see in every European high street, we exited again in to the northern side, which seemed more traditional before retracing our steps. A rare opportunity to visit a divided city. Attached photo was just inside the north, google umbrellas.",Ledras
50,A weird crossing tbrough the city into the world of fake goods to tempt you into breaking the law. If caught you'll lose you booty. Uncomfortable feeling when crossing but we do it every time we come to Cyprus.,Ledras
40,"Interesting experience (and unique in the world). Worth stopping by the sculpture at the crossing point: ""Resolution"" (Civil Rights Monument), placed in front of the National Guard border crossing post reiterates the faith of the inhabitants of Nicosia in human rights as the only precondition to peace & freedom. Check it out closely: on the round cement basis of approximately a meter in height, part of the text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is written in embossed Greek letters. A stack of steel lances diagonally arranged hit the center of the text, symbolically destroying it. (the credits go to the artist: Theodoulos Gregoriou)",Ledras
40,You need to buy frozen water from the shops 100 metres before the crossing. This will keep you cool for over an hour all for 50 cents. If you go by car. There's plenty of parking within 300 metres or so of the border. (Ours was €2 an hour)My top tip is to leave a swimming costume in your car. When you've done the crossing and are back in your car type in outdoor pool into your phone. We went to the Municipal outdoor pool and spent 4 hours cooling down. Well worth €6 for an adult. Massive pool with all amenities.,Ledras
40,Not a very common event crossing over to the other part of the city and being in another country - so had to do it!Passport control and customs are very efficient and polite - just used ID card.Buffer zone also interesting - deserted and left abandoned. Somehow i got a feeling that it is left like this as a tourist attraction,Ledras
50,"I have to say I was shocked to cross the border on the street in the same town with a passport.Luckily they didn't go throw our stuff and bags, but if they did it would have been a horrible experience.The town is not just divided by a border, it is also divided by language, currency and nations that live in it.I hope they will unite some day in the future!A very important thing is that you can pay everything you buy on both sides in euros.Always remember that.",Ledras
30,The monument say it all and it is very interesting to read it. Crossing is easy and you need to have passport with you. Turkish side is not so nice.,Ledras
20,Overrated - stay in the West - turkish side of the boarder is so borring. They Only sell brand copies. Stay in the West,Ledras
50,"A must see if you are in Nicosia, a very small control point get yer passport checked twice in 20 m between north and south Cyprus.",Ledras
40,"this is the most interesting part of Nicosia. In the middle of the main street border and passport control. Even the clock moves when you enter the Turkish part. Pay attention when you overlook the Turks you are not trying to stamp because no one has confessed to Turkey's Republic of Northern Cyprus republic, and in return, the Greeks can make a problem. Ask them not to stamp the stamp but only to scan. This border shows all the absurdity of the bad politics and the division of one small society.",Ledras
40,"We went to Ledra street. It was packed with people from different races, religions and countries. Nice way to spend time. We ate at a Greek restaurant.",Ledras
40,It feels like revisiting the cold war and crossing check point Charlie in Berlin! Worth crossing if you are in Nicosia. Do not forget to bring your passport.,Ledras
30,"This crossing point is ok, but there is nothing special about it.There was a big queue on the Turkish side. Bring your passports.",Ledras
50,So many lives lost... visit and learn the history of the only decided occupied town in the world. Very touching,Ledras
40,You can walk over to the Turkish side of Lefkosia and have a look around- as long as you bring your passport/ ID card.,Ledras
30,"Sorry but a crossing point is just that ""a crossing point""! Yes, it's quirky and sad but a tourist attraction no. You are not allowed to bring back any fake Turkish goods they will be confiscated as you're expected to buy only Greek fake goods! Not much to see once on the Turkish side that is any different from the Cypriot side. Food is cheaper though and I can recommend the restaurant in the Buyuk Han. If there's a large queue it can take quite a few minutes so maybe leave it and then return later. WARNING! Many mobile phone providers do not include Turkish occupied northern Cyprus in their EU roaming so switch your mobile off, it could cost you!! Also NO PHOTOGRAPHS",Ledras
40,"It's a very emotional place, the last city which is divided along political and religions grounds. The sculpture outside the crossing is very telling of the history and emotions around this place. We didn't cross through, however it looked very simple and their were no lines at all.",Ledras
30,"Ledra street is where the borders between Turkey and Cyprus is! The Cypriot side is much better and cleaner where the other side is dirty! The shopping on the Turkish side is full of fake brands products where on the Cypriot side, it is not legal to sell fake brands! It is nice to visit the only divided capital in the world!",Ledras
50,We went across on the Ledra Palace crossing and then back via the Ledra street crossing.The palace option gives you more dereliction to see...amazing villas trapped in the barbed wire zone.How much longer ?Very calm no mans land zone.The shopping street is on parade of tut shops seperatedby a border that is pointless.,Ledras
30,"It is very easy to cross the border on Ledra Street with a British or other EU passport. Show it as you leave the South and show it again10 metres on to the Turkish officers as you enter the North. And in reverse when you return to the South. It is all computerised now so there are no stamps or papers. I went across just to visit the interesting Cathedral of Sophia, now operating as a mosque. Other than that the anorth is just a slightly less inviting version of the South. I did feel a little be uneasy away from the mosque and shopping streets.",Ledras
40,Let us not talk about politics but the easy access. It is very smooth and simple in and out from either side.,Ledras
30,"Half way down a street, you come to a cordoned off check point, where you need to show your passport , to get through. On the ""other side"" are lots of shops with fake goods galore. Quite say, 40 years has not been enough time to heal wounds.",Ledras
50,We crossed from Greek Nicosia to Lefkosa Turk on foot.It was simple and no problems at all. In total took 1 minute.Quite strange having a divided city.,Ledras
50,This is a must do!!! Don’t skip it. I didn’t get to ever see the Berlin during the divided period. I wanted to see this and was not disappointed. What an experience,Ledras
50,"This is a strange feeling to cross frontiers within one city: from Lidras South part to the North side of Nicosia, you cross a border and enter a totally different atmosphere. The passage itself is not problematic: you just must have a valid ID to go from South to North and back :) A must-try!",Ledras
40,Intersting to see and to cross. And very sad to see all this division. Ethnic conflict of 40 years ago seems still so hard to solve.,Ledras
40,It is definitely the most vibrant street in Nicosia where you can find all kind of restaurants and coffee shops mainly. It is busy street mainly after 12ham. You can find also several churches and cross at the end of the street the boarder. Interesting place to visit and pass by also other parallel streets. Don’t moss,Ledras
20,"Apart from the simple but boring process of having to show ones passport when crossing this frontier the difference between the sides is soon evident.The northern (Turkish) part is significantly poorer than the southern (Greek) side. The people are just as engaging and helpful, it’s just noticeable that there is a large economic divide.Ledra Street, on either side, is dull and boring with little to recommend it.",Ledras
40,"Crossing from the North to the Greek south was without problems and, a couple of hours later, the reverse process went well too! European Community citizens just need to produce their EC passports. The transit between the zones involves a 'no mans land' patrolled by the UN.",Ledras
30,"We were in Nicosia and decided that we have give this a look. The crossing process is simple on both sides of the checkpoint. It was interesting to see the totally unashamed merchandising of shops filled with fake designer gear on the Turkish side against the more conservative correct approach to shopping on the Cypriot side of the city.We had a reasonable walk round the Turkish side and also stopped for some light refreshments, which I have to say was good. I was not expecting to have a frozen glass presented to me for my beer at a small cafe. This was a very good touch. The other drinks and food were also inexpensive.Interesting to see the differences and overall worthwhile.",Ledras
40,"a very famous street where u can do shopping,eat,take a rest in restaurant or cafe shop,eat delicious ice cream with your custom made.also u can go to the Turkish side by just showing your passport.",Ledras
50,Just like walking through a section of town. Just show your passport at each end. Great walking areas on both sides.,Ledras
50,"Several decades ago when I used to live in this area, this crossing was not possible, so I jumped at the possibility of visited the Turkish side of Nicosia where I have never been before.Clearly both governments realised the economic impact this creates on the Turkish side and how much they could benefit out of selling their fake designer items the shop owners on the northern side do so un-ashamedly. I already reported them to Sophia Webster as this is one of the names you can find here besides Gucci etcThe crossing point requires a passport as you pass the Cypriot and the Turkish passport checks both when you go and return and could be very fast if there is no big group in front of you.Should there no be this crossing point, you would not realise you go into the occupied area, which probably was even more prosperous than it was nowadays. Blame it on the greedy politicians who do not care about the normal people. I know this really angers the Greek Cypriot people very much.",Ledras
10,"We drove over 2 hours to go see 'No mans land'. Although I had read various clips nothing had told me we needed a passport to cross. Obvious to us now as it is a boarder crossing but did not realise this at the time. So a wasted journey all round as we did not get to see anything.Walked a couple of streets and had a coffee, that was it.So remember Take your PASSPORT if you want to cross the boarder",Ledras
10,"I have crossed over many times. It is a travesty and a tragedy that this Crossing Point should impede free movement of people. Politicians should make an agreement to solve the Cyprus problem, but they have failed, even after more than 40 years of trying. The sooner it is removed the better.",Ledras
40,"Nicosia (Lefkosia) offers a unique experience with its contrast between the two sides of the amazing capital. Passport in hands!!! Take your time to explore the south and north side and experience the diversity of the Greek and Turkish culture equally. The last divided capital has registered the history of Cyprus in an architectural and economic way that the north and south have strongly stated themselves. Get around the Old City, it is an enjoyable walk along the narrow streets, paying attention all the details, including some street art. We can go from a Greek coffee to a Turkish delight in just a few steps away from each other, an opportunity that cannot be missed.",Ledras
40,"I was visiting Nicosia, and I wanted to have a look at the Turkish side, too, so I crossed border at Ledra street. Everything went smooth and quick, border guards were very friendly on both sides, and the same was on my way back.The Greek and the Turkish sides of Nicosia are very different, but I felt welcomed and perfectly safe on both sides.Too bad they cannot agree to reunite the city and the island...",Ledras
10,"As we waited to cross back l hear same old moans and groans and see nothing has changed on the Greek side apart from a decaying monument, Unfortunately it will never change in my lifetime. There have been some fantastic offers of reconciliation,Always refused by the Greek side. Having seen the Changes in the TRNC. The issue looks set in stone.",Ledras
50,"Didn't really expect to find a border control here or as the locals call it a checkpoint :)Very interesting but sad history, the monument is rather creative.You can find it at the end of one of the busiest streets in the city.",Ledras
50,Until 10 years ago the area was fully militarized. Now you can cross to the North part of nicosia in a few minutes. Ledra street is at the heart of Nicosia and its a place for relaxation as well as memories.,Ledras
40,"Much more interesting than the turkish market with all the fake cloth and stuff is, to have a look around the architecture on the other side.",Ledras
50,It was a real pleasure to see how two formerly warring sides put their bitter conflict aside to create normalcy. I can only wish such crossings to the entire Middle East.All you need is to show your passport twice and you're good to go.,Ledras
40,"If you are in Nicosia you can't miss this. It's a piece of history. If you have your ID with you you can pass in the Turkish side where all is different, the shops and people.",Ledras
50,this is place where you can get into occupied part of Cyprus - they called it Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus - you can see difference between Europe and Asia (Yes - Cyprus belongs to Asia),Ledras
50,This is the crossing point and it is not a pleasant place. People who cross are uninsured on the other side even if they try to tell you otherwise. I would not cross myself.,Ledras
50,If your in town it's really quite an experience and very odd to go from a road of traditional bars into a road full of high street chains . Possibly the closest you will.get to time travel,Ledras
50,"The Ledra street crossing is quick and easy - popped across from South to North for pre-Meze beers at a street bar serving giant cold Efes! Just don't a) take photos in the vicinity or buffer zone, b) forget your passport or c) try to bring back any counterfeit goods - you WILL have them confiscated on the way back South! This is a must-do diversion/excursion if you are in Nicosia, it feels just as safe either side of the crossing, but clearly it feels as if you've entered another world...",Ledras
30,The crossing is a weird place. It’s in a shopping street and one minute your on the Greek side and the next you have to go through two passport check area with the buffer zone in between to get to the Turkish side.There is a very touristy area on the Turkish side with covered market areas representing some sort of bazaar area all selling counterfeit good very cheap.,Ledras
40,"So like all the tourists, we crossed over to the Northern side of Nicosia. As I gave my passport to the Turkish immigration officer, he was playing music in his booth. The song? ""Imagine."" I commented that this song is very appropriate for this area and he smiled and agreed.After seeing that there was not much to do on the other side, after 10 minutes we returned to explore the lovely alleyways with cafe and shops in the southern side of the old city of Nicosia. The crossing in both directions was quick - really only a minute at each border crossing.Best to park in the parking lot outside the walls and walk to the border.You might want to take a guided tour of both sides of the city to see the sites. We visited during the Easter holiday so most places were closed.",Ledras
30,Took passport and went through really easily from the Greek side but the Turks made us wait first in the rain and then in the 89 degree sun,Ledras
40,Smooth passage for those not born in the wrong time at the wrong place. So we had to leave our Turkish born guide North of the crossing point. Very contrasting atmosphere in the opposite parts of this divided capital. You get a glimpse of the green line when walking between the passport controls.,Ledras
30,"We have crossed the border at Leda Street twice this year. It's a painless process. You simply join the queue, which was only a couple of people long both times, show your passport and pass through first the Greek border control and then the Turkish border control. There was no additional paperwork. There is really nothing to see in the no mans land area as it isn't fenced off and simply the backs of abandoned buildings.",Ledras
50,"The most unique, mixed feelings ""tourist sightseeing ""can exist in Europe. A Must place to be...The statue in the end of ledra street also indicates all the human rights that are being violated with the illegal Turkish occupation in 1974.",Ledras
50,It is have to see because that street separates Greek part from Turkish one. Many shops and restaurants there.,Ledras
30,"This is a busy crossing into The Turkish North of Cyprus. We queued for about 15 minutes to get into the North, returning back was slightly quicker. You passport is scanned each time but no stamp (to the disappointment of my husband). It is a walk of about 50 yards through the buffer zone and no photographs are permitted. It is worth the effort to see the contrasting sides. We passed our time in the queue watching customs in the South confiscating rolling tobacco from the bags of those entering from the North.",Ledras
40,"You can cross from north to south Cyprus here on foot. There are two checkpoints, one police, one border control. You need your passport to cross (but you don't get a stamp)",Ledras
50,The only thing you should keep in mind if you plan to cross the border is that you should bring your passport. Passport control takes only 1 minute and you'll have no new stamps in it on entrance or returning.,Ledras
40,This is the question one asks at this border checkpoint. Kind of absurd there should be one at all. Very easy to get from south to north. Short waiting time.,Ledras
20,"There are two check points, one on the Greek cypriot side and one on the Turkish cypriot side manned by policemen. It is really sad to see people who have to go through a check point in order to visit their own land and property which is under occupation. It makes you wonder why a solution to the Cyprus issue has not been found yet.No special instructions for visitors. The crossing is safe.",Ledras
30,"Your passport is all you need. Passing through the ""dead zone"", as its called, you cross from the Greek side to theTurkish side. Worth doing.",Ledras
30,"Sad to read that this is the country to have the last divide. The boarder crossing was not as impressive as I had thought. Two police huts and an empty street are all that the boarder is. No UN guards as I was lead to believe.Reminded me of the old Berlin check points.That said, there were plenty of cafes and shops.Worth a visit to say you've been there and seen it.",Ledras
50,"Outstansing service fresh and freshly made tasty breakfast, great coffee and outstanding service at a low price. I expected to pay more for the overall experience. I tried it not once but three times. If you are a breakfast lover you MUST have breakfast here.",Ledras
40,Multi cultural place u sea the deferent of the Greek and the Turkishcypriot site I have to cross the border is nice expired fake staff u can buy and cold and silver cheaper than the Europecyoriot site. Sat u can find the market place is like a very small instabul,Ledras
40,End of famus Ledras street. The oldest shop center of the island. Now the right place to have a meal or a coffee,Ledras
30,"Sad to visit such a place, which divides the two sides. Not much of an atrraction. Rather a place of sorrow.",Ledras
20,Emmm.. ok a cross point to go to the other site of Nicosia. How wrong can it be? It serves its purpose i guess. You can argue of it is good or bad.,Ledras
40,"Although things seems to be much more relaxed than how they were some years ago apparently, it is a good place to be teleported to how Berlin might had been like during the 70s and 80s.",Ledras
40,"Had some free time while on business in Nicosia and used the Ledra Street crossing point to visit the northern half of the city. Very straightforward, you need your passport, it isn’t stamped and no fee. Join the short queue to leave the Greek part and cross no-man’s land to the Turkish part, queue again, and you’re in.While in the north side lots to see - I went to a performance of whirling dervishes adjacent to a mosque built from the former Catholic cathedral, impressive. Plenty of places to eat, shops selling what didn’t look like genuine designer brands etc. A worthwhile experience - the welcome is equal both sides of the border.",Ledras
50,"Easy crossing point in the heart of shops and restaurants both sides, just show your passport at both check points.Made a nice day out as staying in the North.",Ledras
40,We crossed the border into the North side for a lovely lunch and a wander round the narrow streets. Didn't buy anything as mostly dodgy faked stuff. Back into the South for tea. A very nice day out - don;t forget your passport.,Ledras
50,Easy to go across to the North side now all is required is for you to have a valid passport. All in all we showed our passports at both sides and we were on our way 10 minutes and we were among the shops in the North side of Nicosia.Both border / passport control points were very helpful and easy to pass and there wasn't a requirement for a visa or any payment. I would recommend anyone who visits Nicosia to go across at Ledra Street.Mike CollinsPafos,Ledras
50,What more can I say? Just show your passport on the Turkish side and you are across the border in a couple of minutes. Pedestrians only. No vehicles. On the way back you have to be signed out by the Turkish side and signed in on the Greek side. Simples!,Ledras
40,"Been over the boarder many times now and never experienced any issues. It's straightforward you just queue, and they deal with you very quickly. DONT FORGET YOUR PASSPORT though as without it you are going nowhere",Ledras
30,We tried to cross here a couple of days ago but only had a photo copy of passports so not allowed to cross. This time we had our original passports and crossed easily. It’s odd passing no mans land and the contrast between north and south was quite noticeable.,Ledras
50,"Its a so interesting experinece to crossing a border within a city! You can solve this approx. during 5 min, absolutely affordable.",Ledras
50,"I actually crossed in June 16 but can’t list that. It was very simple, you just need your passport. The lines were short and signs were helpful",Ledras
20,"Was staying in Limassol for the week, visited Nicosia and went over the border to Turkey.what a difference, on showing passports on the Cyprus side the police wasn't very friendly, even worse on the Turkish side, no hello's or thank you's so going back through i just presented my passport and said nothing, a friendly hello doesn't take much! Old looking buildings in a sorry state, the people not very friendly, we seen numerous of Turkish men spitting in the street, to be honest was glad to get back into Nicosia as the Turkish wasn't very friendly at all, felt really awkward walking around, The shops wasn't cheap either.It was an experience but wouldn't go again.",Ledras
40,"Easy to cross walking!No problem, just show your passaport on the way out and in and vice versa...It is interesting to see the sad situation of a divided city!!!!",Ledras
40,"It is like in Berlin during the cold war. Beware of Greek police - they can be very unpleasant in contrast to the Turkish police, which is very professional and friendly to the tourists.",Ledras
40,"The area has many pubs/restaurants and lots of shops selling handicrafts.perfect place to have a walk and dine to be relax, specially after long busy days.",Ledras
40,"Visited at night and also during day, both nice although night time nicer . pay attention that at night some clothes shops might be closed. At the end of the street you will reach the border with the occupied side (by Turkey)",Ledras
40,We had met our friends nearby and went to the Crossing point which divides this famous City. Sad but true you experience the sights in places of what must have been terrifying for those caught up in the 1974 Invasion. The actual crossing is easy although at times very busy. You do pass through two separate points - out of the South through what is in effect No Mans Land and into the North - and you will require your ID Card or Passport.,Ledras
30,"All a bit tatty. I'm afraid its all a question of 'So What!' Access to N Cyprus is simple, but take your passport.",Ledras
30,"Drawn in 1964 with a green pen line on a map of Nicosia by a United Nations officer and extended in 1974 following the Turkish invasion and de facto annexation in Cyprus, the 'green line' cuts through the centre of the old walls.However in 2003, a pedestrian crossing opened at the top end of Ledra street on the Greek Cypriot side, allowing passage between the two sides.From Ledra street which is a shopping centre, there is a passport and customs checkpoint followed by a 30 metres long no man's land. The Turkish checkpoint stands at its end and you arrive in the Arasta area.The crossing checkpoints, on each side, are well organised, smooth and tourist friendly.Just remember to take your passports and adjust your watches as you enter different time zones.Keep in mind that banks and some shops on the Turkish side close for prayers, so adjust your watches to the local time. And if you return or cross to the Cypriot side, note that you are entering the European Union and that EU restrictions apply to some shopping items and the amount of money that you can carry with you.The experience is still quite eerie, but only if you are conscious of the sad history that makes Nicosia the only divided capital city in the world.Nevertheless, enjoy the sites, their beauty and the contrast of each side. The stunning 16th century old walls somehow still unite the old city of Nicosia.",Ledras
50,"This is such an easy crossing, but don't believe that by going into Northern Nicosia you are seeing Northern Cyprus. Spend a few days in the north - hire a car and drive out to Kyrenia or the Karpaz/Karpas peninsula, or better still visit the ruins at Salamis near Famagusta. This is a beautiful country, both north and south - and both very different.",Ledras
50,"The last divided capital of Europe has the green line that separates north and south part of the island.. The ""twin crime"" of Greek and Turkish governments, which both decided to separate the island during 1974, without asking the local people if they wished for it or not.. Coup d'etat by the greek junta, invasion by the turking, a crime that is ""legalized"" during the decades, copied in several parts of the world where the powerful site controls the weak.",Ledras
50,"It felt absolutely surreal to cross a no-man's-land in a modern capital, especially in an EU country. It is a very smooth crossing and there was no drama or issue but it still felt like something from a bygone era.",Ledras
50,In all fairness I went to see it without doing much research beforehand. I was pleasantly impressed by the stored around in the citys shopping alley. But then the stores started to be less and less crowded and then there it was. A round circle and policemen im the area. We presented our ids and then went through. Lively atmosphere and shops everywhere. In a very immersive experience. I was a bit shocked but i would go again.,Ledras
50,"This experience is like stepping into a movie - a real tale of two cites. The Greek side is full of high street shops, boutiques and swish trendy restaurants...and then you cross the passport barrier onto the rustic Turkish side, with picturesque mosques , interesting bazaars selling counterfeit goods, sleepy cafes. Most of them accept Euro’s and Lira.Both sides were so contrasting, that I couldn’t decide which one I liked the best. I was overawed by the whole experience and the tragic history that underpins this crossing point. You can spend a whole day exploring both sides.Overall, the border staff were friendly, there were no queues and it was relatively easy and painless.A trip to Ledra is incomplete without crossing the border...just remember your passport!",Ledras
50,"Visited Nicosia on a tour with Ruslan Travel. Werent sure whether to go into north but so pleased we did. Lots to see, I could have spent much longer than the hour we had there.The border staff were polite and friendly.",Ledras
40,Come see both sides of Nicosia. The Turkish side isn't as vibrant but does have many shops selling knock off products (beware). A few nearby sites but not much to see. Worth stopping to get another country. Can cross have lunch ant return I. 90 minutes.,Ledras
40,"The Greek side was full of life, when crossing we found it quite intimidating. It was quite and erry almost. We stuck to close by streets and crossed back after half hour",Ledras
20,"Well it looks like a monument of division, but lacks the festivity... generally just a point to cross and be passport checked. At least it is a formality and takes a few minutes.",Ledras
30,This is an ideal way to see what goes on in the so called north of the Island. The Turkish locals are all very friendly and eager to take your money for their goods with a smile. I would also advise that you take time to visit the rest of the area time permitting.,Ledras
50,These days it is a straightforward process of passport examination and scanning and is accepted by both parties. No longer are passports stamped causing any problems entering other countries any more. However it is reported in the press that there still can be problems if using ports and airports in the south for holidays in the north. There still remains the moral issue of whether you should be seen to be condoning the actions of the Turks. Once across have a look at the information kiosk on the left hand side and pick up the relevant maps which are not obtainable in the south and follow the blue line as much as it still exists !,Ledras
50,Cross these borders and learn from history. Border are there to be crossed and to get together. There are friendly officers on both sides. It is a weird feeling for Germans that know how a divided city is like.,Ledras
40,"It is a 10 minute walk from solomou bus station (i reached nicosia from paphos by bus), so it was good point to start. There was not much queue at 11am , but you will need to show passport on both sides. When i come back , the custom searched my bag for cigarettes (which i did not buy).",Ledras
40,"Bring your passport for crossing the Green Zone into the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus.Easy crossing, short walk to North Nicosia where you can pick up some tourism information at the small booth on the left past passport control. Then you'll see lots of shops, many selling knock-off products like handbags, shoes, sunglasses and clothing.Before you buy, know that Cyprus Customs examines bags of people returning and if you're found to be in possession of counterfeit goods they will be confiscated!Take the time to walk through the eerie Green Zone and see the empty buildings in various states of decay.",Ledras
50,"We were walking along the UN Green Line which divides the two sectors of Nicosia when we happened upon the crossing point which we discovered later has been in place since 2003. So we nipped back to our accommodation to retrieve our passports which are obviously required at both border control stations. Having passed through the Greek check point we walked 60 yards or so to their Turkish opposite numbers. I was asked if it was my first visit and answered in the affirmative.It was fascinating to see some of the other half of the city, albeit the area is full of tourists visiting out of curiosity. The narrow streets are full of market style shops and stalls selling cheap sports clothing much of which may have carried fake branding. Whatever, some of it seemed to offer decent value.We had a walk around the mosque, the former Saint Sophia Cathedral which is worth seeing and then found a decent restaurant for lunch before heading back to the Greek side.",Ledras
40,"It is not a problem to cross over to TRC from the Greek side but you need a passport. they will not stamp it for you as many countries did not recognise TRC. The food on the Turkish side is great value for money, cigs are cheaper and sightseeing is very good. There are no queues at the border crossing, it is very efficient",Ledras
30,"If you wish to make a pedestrian visit into the Turkish part of Nicosia then the Ledra Street crossing is a convenient point to use. However, it can be problematic when large parties of tourists also wish to cross as long queues can develop. The procedure requires your details to be entered manually into the border police computers and this can be very frustrating when one is being jostled by impatient and ill-mannered visitors while being baked in the summer sun! Please be warned that the temperature often exceeds 40C in the summer and there is a paucity of shade in the queuing areas.Once through, the situation improves and you can enjoy the area beyond.",Ledras
40,We stayed mins away and crossed multiple times with no more than a few mins wait in line. It's convenient and safe.,Ledras
30,A short consumers street that connects the divided capital of Cyprus. Good for having a coffee or meal.,Ledras
40,"Cyprus being a divided nation has a ""border"" zone running through the capital. If you want to go to the Turkish controlled north part, this is a foot crossing in old Nicosia. Well worth going. The crossing itself is really just checkpoint on both sides. Bring your passport. You won't get scrutinized too much unless they are not busy. I crossed several times and it was always different depending on the people and the time of day. A few places on the Turkish side take credit cards but you may need to change to Turkish Lira for extensive shopping. I haven't found another place to review the bazaar area but there are some good restaurants after you cross.",Ledras
30,"This is a convenient pedestrian crossing point in the centre of Nicosia. Crossing allows you to see the complete contrast between the North and South cultures. When we visited in November, there were no queues either way.",Ledras
50,"We crossed at about 10.30am when there was no queue, there were quite long queues from the South when we returned around 12 noon. The crossing was very easy, if anything, it took longer on the south side as they now scan your passport.The north is an interesting contrast, many shops seem to sell fake goods (there are warnings about bringing these back at the border) but there are many selling good unbranded clothes, ceramics, brass and table linen.",Ledras
50,Very convenient and efficient pedestrian crossing in the heart of Nicosia. No issues in either direction.,Ledras
40,It was interesting to go through the Ledra street crossing. Different attitude between those checking passports on each side. One very formal and one very relaxed. Crossed in the evening and the north of Nicosia was very quiet in comparison but will some beautiful buildings just to the right after going through,Ledras
50,"We came through from the historic Old Town from the Turkish side in early November, queues were roughly 5 minutes each way.The contrast between the colorful if slightly down at heel Turkish North and the much more western and prosperous Greek South is stark, and well worth seeing to illustrate the differences in this divided country, and of course the only divided city in the world!There is no charge, but remember to bring your passport!",Ledras
40,"Having never been to a divided city before, it was an odd experience, especially if you're used to travelling around Europe where border controls are non-existent.Passports are checked on both sides of the border as you pass through. On the Greek side this is little more than a quick glance, but there is far more scrutiny on the Turkish side. Although it only took us a couple of minutes to pass through, I could imagine there would be long queues at peak times.Worth crossing the border to see the difference between the Greek & Turkish parts of the city.Lots of counterfeit goods for sale on the Turkish side, but I'm told the Greeks confiscate these when you pass back through the border.",Ledras
50,You can’t miss it as it in the middle of the city. Very sad to see the divided capital. You can cross the board if you have an id.,Ledras
40,"The stark difference between north and south is starkly seen here. As a European you go through the checkpoint on the south side easily, but the queue for the north, where your passport is scrutinised, takes quite a while, leaving you standing in a long slow moving queue in the unrelenting sun, for ages. No seating, drinks etc. So do be aware and be prepared! The north side is so much poorer but has some fascinating architectural sites, whereas the south is a bustling, wealthy town with every Costs and Starbucks etc - but not as atmospheric.",Ledras
40,We used this crosiing point to visit the occupied part of nicosia where there are some interesting archeological sites like the Ayia Sophia etc. It takes you 5 to 10 minutes to oass through the turkish check point because you have to show your id to pass. I am a greek cypriot refugee and i feel really sad and unhappy to be a refugge in the same country and to tell you that your places do not belong to you but to the turks and also to show id to go and see your home.,Ledras
50,Nice experience for a short walk to a North side of Cyprus. You can see totally different type of life there.,Ledras
50,This is the last border of a european city standing there just to remind that they(Turkish) capture half of the island through invation in 1974.,Ledras
40,"Having been in Berlin before 1990, I felt compelled to see how a divided city still worked. The crossing and various points along the Green Iine bring that out. Now the crossing is fairly easy, show your passport (both sides) and they wave you over. there is a Turkish tourist office on left as you enter the North side. On Cyprus side there is a nice sculpture, worth having a look. and the street on both sides is packed with restaurants and junk shops. while the Turkish side is somewhat less developed, they are both very interested in business and tourists. Although the Turkish side uses Lire, they seem to accept Euros in this immediate area. Back to the Berlin analogy, it seemed mostly sad that they cannot find a way to ope up the city, but it was not really scary like Berlin was in the 1980s. Seeing sandbags, some still shot out windows and green painted barrels at the ends of streets, as well as guards with serious rifles does make it real, but mostly sad.",Ledras
40,This is popular thing to do whilst in Nicosia and we are glad we did it. Don’t forget to take your passport or it is definitely a nonstarter.Walk up Ledra Street and eventually you will come to the crossing. It is quite an eerie place and has an atmosphere all of its own. There can be queues but the process is quite quick and you get through the first gate quite quickly. You will then come to another checkpoint after walking through a kind of No mans land again you are pretty much waved through and then you are in Turkey!It does have a different feel over that side of the border and it is Interesting to experience a different side of the island.,Ledras
40,"On each side there are two sets of ""officers"" perusing passports in a most cursory manner. What a shining example of political nonsense. Worth it for the experience though and also to see the difference between the Turkish and Greek sides.",Ledras
40,"The Girls were over for Half-Term and wanted to experience Ledra Street. Off we trundled and the street itself is Pedestrianised for the majority of its length and has Shops, Chains, Coffee Outlets, Eateries and basically something for everyone. This combined creates a lovely friendly atmosphere with the Hustle & Bustle of Life all around. Once you reach the Crossing Point it becomes all too real how sad it is with this Divided City. You have to show your Passport to leave the South and then stroll a 100 metres or so in No Mans Land to reach the Turkish Sid where you show your Passport once again to enter the North. All very very busy although friendly enough. Coming back is the reverse where you check out of the North and check in again to the South.",Ledras
10,"The Cypriots are the Border need to learn some manners and the little bit of power has clearly gone to some of there heads , my teenage daughter and myself went from paphos to here for a day trip we handed our passports over he started shouting where her father where ? Not that it's any of his business but my daughter not seen her dad in 17 years so why he asking that .. he said come back when your 18 only when another member of staff appeared he shut up , I do wonder if it was a boy and his father would he if spoken to them like it , we eventually went through the Turks border people really lovely dead friendly ..",Ledras
40,There is not that much to see in Nicosia. It seems that most tourists just wanted to see the crossing point and cross to boarder since it's exiting experience. Lots of pirate products sold at Turkish side but you should not buy those to support unleagal piratism and good to know that it's forbidden to bring those products when coming back to south side of Cyprus.,Ledras
40,Two sides of the same street............take your Passport and you can cross pretty easily. It is interesting to see both sides from their different perspectives. You will also find some great bargains on the north side as it is cheaper and there are some good architectural gems to see. Just play it cool when crossing be patient and respectful and you will be fine!!,Ledras
50,It should not be a crossing point. Nicosia is still divided and crossing the other side is politically wrong for every EU citizen that respects The Republic of Cyprus.,Ledras
50,Going through and having to show your passport seems a little surreal in the last divided capital city. Very efficient process and a simple way to cross into occupied Nicosia.,Ledras
50,"Had to do it whilst in Nicosia it is really busy and friendly , lots of shops and ice cream parlours a must if you are in the area",Ledras
20,"We had seen rather a lot the Greek portion of Nicosia on foot. We had heard a great deal about the Turkish section and decided to take a walk around and see for ourselves. But first we had to negotiate what the locals refer to as Checkpoint Charlie. We had heard all sorts of stories about how strict the controls were and it seemed a mite daunting in prospect.The reality is really rather ordinary. You produce your passport on the Greek side. A bored policeman scans it on his machine and hands it back to you after half a minute or so. There are notices next to the cabin in which he sits telling us that we must not buy counterfeit goods over the border and bring them back with us. There is no mention of penalties if we do. In practice we had been told already, the goods are confiscated and that's it.You then walk about 30 metres and go through the same routine in the Turkish side. Another bored policeman, another scan and you're in the Turkish sector. There are lots of counterfeit goods available, notably watches. A fake Rolex or an Audemar Piguet, whatever the brand, they all seemed to be around 40 Euros. I suppose it's quite interesting to look at them in the shop windows but in truth they are not particularly tempting. I don't any of them would fool anybody once they look at them properly even if you were of a mind to buy one.The return trip through the checkpoint later that day was just as unexciting as the first one. There was a policewoman sitting at the sort of small, circular, white table you can see outside and of a dozen and more cafes in Ledra Street. She made no attempt to look at anyone's bags. It was all very relaxed. Some people, obviously locals came through with what looked like their domestic food shopping in carrier bags. They probably do so several times a week. Nobody takes any notice.Ledra Street is a pedestrian crossing only. There's another crossing for vehicles elsewhere.",Ledras
40,Old Area with nice restaurants and cafes.Very nice when visiting this place and road at night. Enjoy your time!!,Ledras
50,"Different feeling, a must do in Cyprus you walk and cross a border and you are in a different country, if you think you had enough tour than come back and walk through the border as you cross between two countries you will be able to see United Nations soldiers in between two countries.",Ledras
40,"No problems getting through the crossing, very efficient. Do not forget to take your passport. The north side is very different to the south of Cyprus, it is very hustle and bustle.",Ledras
40,We had to do it pop over and see the neighbours! The crossing experience was much the same as the day trips from the Turkish mainland to Rhodes Meis and Samos. No hassle and a dip in to history for us . We even got to practice a bit of turkish.,Ledras
40,"A sad symbol of the division in Cyprus, interesting nonetheless. This is a full-on immigration point so don't forget your passport if you do want to cross over.",Ledras
40,An interesting though sad experience to see such a beautiful city divided by conflict. Very busy and cosmopolitan.,Ledras
40,The cross point at Ledra street signifies an array of hope between the two communities. The old city of Nicosia is buzzing and this gateway between North and South is seeing an abundance of pedestrian traffic.This is truly the cultural hub of Nicosia.,Ledras
30,"The checkpoint is hard to rate as it is what it is and not exactly a tourist hotspot. However, go to the next street to find a soldier in his observation booth with the sign saying 'Checkpoint Charlie' to get your photos.",Ledras
50,As I live close by this has become a near daily task for me.It's an historic crossing and is a focal point for many of the Unite Cyprus community groups who regularly meet here to sing and hold placards. It's mostly peaceful but be aware of particular dates in the calendar which could mean more enthusiastic crowds.If you are in the area pop by for a look.,Ledras
50,"Ledra street is the biggest attraction in Old Town Nicosia. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops, bars. Located at the end of this street is the border. This road is pedestrians only, so no cars allowed.",Ledras
40,"This crossing point is actually going from one country to another yet without leaving the city. As with normal borders there are two passport controls. There was a queue both sides when we crossed and it took about 20 minutes to go each way.Don't be tempted to follow the locals who just seem to walk past without showing anything.Between the two sides there is an strange no-mans lands patrolled by the United Nations. It gave me a feeling of going back in time to a period when Europe was in turmoil.Both sides are pedestrian only. The shops on the Turkish side are much more touristy offering copies of branded clothes, handbags etc. I would suggest you don't buy anything as when you cross back it will be confiscated.We had a walk around, stopped for a drink in a nice place called Biblioteque, outdoors under a very well designed 'roof' made with linking umbrellas together up high, very colourful.Crossing is worth the experience.",Ledras
50,"Whilst the shopping experiences on both sides are quite typical of tourist experiences, what is unique is that you can cross between the two sides & experience both in a day. That interests me so I enjoyed it very much. I did some shopping on the Greek Cypriot side, then (of course, using my passport) I crossed the border into the Turkish side & experienced the shopping there. I then crossed back to the Greek side where my hotel was. Of course, you need to take care when crossing to ensure you do not take prohibited goods, of exceed customs limits. Crossing just took a few minutes & I really enjoyed this unique experience. You do not get your passport stamped & crossing just takes a few minutes, so if this is your thing - go for it! It was free for me, I have a European passport. I am unsure whether there are charges for other nationalities.",Ledras
50,"We wanted to explore the border crossing on foot so headed for Ledra Street. It's allPedestrianised so no traffic to contend with. You will need your passport to make the crossing in either direction. Security is tight but not like airport security. The border is monitored by CCTV so unobtrusive. There is about 20 metres between the Cypriot and Turkish borders. The buffer zone is apparent as you walk between checkpoints. However, not intimidating or having a high presence of armed guards. Once through to the Turkish side there are a good number of shops and stalls that have a number of goods for sale, much of which are designer labels, they look genuine but you never know!! There are plenty of interesting places to visit as well as shop.",Ledras
40,"Crossing into the Turkish side of Cyprus, one has to cross two passport controls that are separated by a no man's land in the middle. It's a bit sad to see such a small island divided in this manner and with this level of passport control.",Ledras
40,"I realy like this Street which reflect the culture of Cyprus.There are many shops, Restaurants and coffee at this street.",Ledras
30,"We crossed without any problem into Northern Nicosia out of mild curiosity and a 'tick the box' exercise. Wandered the local streets for just over an hour, visited the Selimiye Mosque briefly and returned. The Turkish side did look rather run down compared to the rather more thriving Cypriot side of the city. Daresay it's a must do activity if you happen to be there but would I drive to Nicosia again from Paphos? Probably not.",Ledras
30,From the Northern side the entry point is Lomaci and from the Southern side Ledra Street. Avoid times when people might be traversing due to work hours. Otherwise crossing is painless just a quick compare of faces to pictures in the passports at both ends. There is not much of the Green Line to see here and photos are prohibited.,Ledras
30,"It's a border crossing. You stand in line, usually in the baking hot sun for someone to grumpily look at your passport. There is a green zone with disused buildings right in the heart of the city. It's all very sad to be honest. Don't see how it rates as an excellent tourist attraction moreso a testament to mans stupidity.",Ledras
40,"When traveling in Nicosia, its important to experience ""The Wall."" With our USA Passports it was easy to get through both sides of immigration. Ledra Street on the Cypriot side is full of name brand stores and local fare. The Turkish side is more of a Bazaar feel and fun bartering. Definitely a different experience on both sides of the wall. With the different ""cultural"" feels, your eyes are opened to the conflict that still impacts this island nation(s).",Ledras
50,Important point to be visited by people who visits Cyprus. It enables visitors to understand the deep sadness behind the unfortunate political situation on the island.,Ledras
40,Very safe and fast route close to adjacent shops and cafe restaurantsVery conviniant to visit both sides of town,Ledras
40,Sad to still have a dividing wall among the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. This is their country and they should be able to enjoy freedom on movement etc,Ledras
40,Great place for shopping and walking in an historic landmark so many things you can do it there and a lot of restaurant an landmark must visited,Ledras
50,"It feels unusual crossing the border in which you are taken to somewhere different, but yet on the same street in the same city. The crossing was no problem at all, it's interesting to do this as it's something which is a rare thing in such a context. Be advised if you're bringing ""designer products"" back into the south from the north, that you should try and hide them or if possible make it look as if you already had it. The south are a little prejudice to bringing things over from the north, as the Turkish sell things a lot cheaper. Remember your passport!Would do it again!",Ledras
50,"Just showed my passport on the Greek side, quick glance at it then returned to me, 30 seconds walk to the Turkish check point, showed passport again, all done!",Ledras
40,"Not really sure this classes as an attraction - booths with people checking passports the same the world over, the only difference here being not everyone classes it as a border.Procedurally, you walk up to the greek hut, if you are carrying a British passport they will wave you past with a cheery smile and thumbs - up and you will walk 50 yards to the Turkish huts where they will scan your passport and let you in - no more visas and no stamps. They don't have them anymore thanks to improving relations so stamp hunters will be politely declined. The procedure is the same in reverse except the greeks will make a bit more of a check to see that you haven't bought any fake goods on the Turkish side! In the North, prices are generally in Euros and payments are accepted in both currencies. We found with current exchange rates slightly better value to be had paying in Turkish Lira. The nearest ATM is to be found by walking straight up to the first road with cars on it and turning right. The bank is about 20 yards on the right.",Ledras
50,"The crossing point is straightforward. Just need your passport. The staff scan it then you walk a few metres and then have to show your passport to the staff on the North side. Returning is the same. North side is good for shopping bargains - bags, jewellery but just be aware that if you do a lot of shopping they may check your things as I think there's a limit to the value of items that you can take across.",Ledras
50,"Spend a little time here to cross the boarder to see the other side and whats on offer there, great places to eat on both sides along with the shopping of course",Ledras
50,My wife wanted to cross over so we all went on a day trip from Pafos. Very easy to drive to and park. 5 euros for all day parking right around the corner from the Ledra St crossing. Very easy to cross. They check passports on the Greek and Turkish side. Not that much to see but very sad to see the fact that with no investment the north side is still a ruin. Lots of tourist shops with plenty of fake goods. Found a nice place to eat and then drink and people are friendly. Worth walking around the side roads to see how things are. Oh and we paid in euros and the prices were okay.,Ledras
40,"Lots of cafés and restaurants around here, and quite a few tourist shops. :) There are a few sculptures around here as well. The crossing point to the other side is here, and there are two stages. They check your passport first, and then put it in a machine, and then you enter the demilitarised neutral UN zone. And then you reach the other side! On the Greek side, generally an interesting place for a walk and a small snack.",Ledras
50,Very interesting place to be. You can learn the history of the place. Safe and quite calm place with lots of tavernas to eat nice food in good price,Ledras
40,"Always interesting to witness history. It is remarkable that you cross from one 'country' into 'another' through a checkpoint in the middle of a shopping street. There are boutiques on the one side, a checkpoint and then more shops, as if nothing happened.",Ledras
50,"I enjoy walking across the pavement street of Ledra till the crossing point. A crowding road, full of life with many small and biggers shops, the restaurants and cafes and the always pleasant atmosphere. You cannot visit Nicosia without visiting Ledra street.But, I give my hand to all Turkish Cypriots. I think that I can build strong friendship with all of them. Please, rejoin us, return back to the Republic of Cyprus! We can live together in prosperity and piece without geographic or administrative separations, in a single state, one person one vote, our security will be our matter. We deserve all these. REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS IS OUR COMMON FUTURE. There is no other way to safeguard our future.",Ledras
50,"It was very easy to cross the border, and staff were very quick in processing passports, so don't worry about a queue. The shops on Turkish side charge in both euros or lira. Prices vary a lot, we paid €5 for 2 beers in one cafe, and another air con cafe charged €20 for two of the same beers!! Needless to say, check the menu first. We hear that customs are confiscating t-shirts and other purchases on way back to Cyprus side, they seem to be the counterfeit/copies, and cigarettes. It's not a lot of difference in price though wherever you are buying.In Ledra Street, Cyprus side, above H&M there is an observation tower, you access from the side street - well worth going to if it's still open!",Ledras
50,"During a visit to Lefkosa we decided to go over the border to compare Greek and Turkish sides of the city; fascinating how different they were! We had to show passports at both sides to get in and out. Definitely worth doing - showed the contrasts between the different ""countries""",Ledras
40,Visited Nicosia found it a surreal experience going through both passport controls. You have to do the same on your return also,Ledras
50,Ledra street is a shopping street with mini shops cafes and restaurants is a beautiful place to visit if you want to buy something,Ledras
50,"One of the seven check points along the line of demarkation (180 km long), and one of the three in Nicosia that people can cross to the nothern area of Cyprus, and in this case of Nicosia.You need a valid passport or ID with photo.First Cyprus police will scan and register your details. Then you walk thru the buffer zone (50 meters), to reach the Turkish police.Same procedure with passports.After you finish the visit in Nothern Nicosia must do the same procedure on the way out.You can go out from any other check point along the line.No photos or videos at the check point.",Ledras
30,just a crossing point but of historical value worth a view and to cross over to the other side of the island from one culture to another so close but operate side by side every day,Ledras
40,We went to Nicosia on a shopping trip.It was 41 degrees!Crossing the border was a strange experience within seconds you are in another country.Interesting little twists and turns with a bazaar and plenty of shops.Beautiful church to visit.Enjoyable experience,Ledras
50,"A strange feeling crossing the borders in Nicosia, when I was there it was a gathering about UniteCyprus in the 80 metres no man´s land, don´t forget the passport :)",Ledras
50,"It's relatively easy to use this pedestrian only crossing. You take you passport which you show at the greek Cypriot side, they sometimes load the information on their system sometimes they (I have a British passport). Once you pass this office you walk down the hill and then hand your passport to the Turkish officers whereby they enter all your information into their computer and then give you the passport back. Once over the line you are in a bazar that sells clothing bags etc., which are all fake, so you are unable to take them back over the line. As the greek Cypriot customs will take them from you.Once in the bazaars if you follow the road down to the centre point and turn right up the hill, you will come across a church that has a dervish dancer show, which is worth seeing as it is a religion to them and they will talk you through the show. Sometimes one dancer other times two. If you face the church and bear right you will come across a fabulous restaurant called biblioteque, worth a visit for the ambience, the food is good too. All restaurants and shops take euro as payment. Going back across the line is the same procedure as going. No problems bringing trinkets back over or non branded goods.",Ledras
50,That place show 2 countrys in one place. If you come in Cyprus you should go and visit that street. Many shops and interesting places.,Ledras
50,Nicosia is not the most touristy city but one of the great experience is crossing from one side to other side of the town. Due to the political issues you should bring your id with you to cross,Ledras
40,If you are not clued up on the history of the area you really should look into it! This is a big part of the areas history and well worth to walk across! I felt that it made me appreciate history a little bit more for seeing this and experiencing it.,Ledras
40,"We went to Nicosia, On a sunday. And went to se the old City. The temperatur Was HIGH 43+ so after walking, around, we went to ledra Street crossing point. It Was Easy, first pas control, on The greek side, and the on the turkis side. Everything went Easy.We only stayed for a hour Or so. But it Was, Nice to see, a little OFF the Tyrkis side.Some Nice shops, and some fast food restaurant Are What you see.",Ledras
50,"Try to cross to the Turkish part and explore the cultural difference of Nicosia even you are not planing to visit the Turkish part, worth a visit and photographed of course, it's an unique experience.",Ledras
40,Worth seeing for the one that is intrested in modern history. Small checkpoint to go from Greek in to Turkish Cypriotic area. Memorial in front of checkpoint,Ledras
50,We visited Nicosia and decided to crossover into the north via Ledra Street crossing point which was very easy with no hassle you need passport to cross. Once over you're then in a shopping area packed with shops you can also visit a mosque if your properly dressed. Well worth a visit over there. We went for s walk around the area came to a street covered in bright umbrellas. We also went to Paphos Gate as it's all seemed to be less militarised now has different feel now.,Ledras
40,It's a very colorful street offers everything! Shops ...different kinds of resturants that serves typical food ... american or french food! It reflects the diversity of the society in Nicosia.,Ledras
40,"This is the border from Greek to Turkish Cyprus (Cyprus annexed the Northern part of the country). It is quite easy to pass, sort of like checkpoint Charley in Berlin. You need to show your passport to the Greek side and then again when you enter the Turkish side, just a few feet away. You are not allowed to take photos in no-mans land, so be careful.",Ledras
40,Walked the length of the street. Shops and restaurants on both sides of the road. Perhaps the best shops in Nicosia. Crossed into Turkish Cyprus through the checkpoint at the end of the street. Only had to show my passport. On the way back explored the side streets. Great way to spend several mornings or afternoons having coffee and watching the world go by..,Ledras
50,Crossing to north was quick and easy. Found there were more significant historic sites to srr in the north part of Nicosia.,Ledras
40,The unique shortcut between Europe at the south and Arabia at the nord... One day north will be free again.,Ledras
50,"Unique crossing experience. Feels like you are leaving one country for another but technically you are not. This divided city is a bit strange at first. The boarded patrol are serious and the ""No Pictures"" during time in green zone is strictly enforced. I saw a man questioned by boarder police for breaking this rule. Have your ID ready for both sides. Worth the visit and food and goods are cheaper in the North.",Ledras
40,"We go there, we eat, is a good ppace but no Sunday, is very busy and you can not eat or do something",Ledras
40,A quick and easy way to visit the shops over in the North.Plenty to see and places to eat at a very reasonable price.,Ledras
10,"It's a must see to anyone going to Cyprus, but a big disappointment , the crossing to the Turkish part is a long queue both entering and leaving (basically only because they can )The Turkish side has the usual ""knock off "" handbags, t shirts etc., but you are advised that any purchases may be confiscated when crossing back , we were told one t shirt each was OK. Not worth the two hour drive each way from Pathos",Ledras
40,It is sad that Nicosia is divided in this way but this is well worth a visit - take your passport and walk across there is a wealth of interesting history in short walking distance both sides of the crossing.,Ledras
40,"Very nice area , traditional, many restaurants with good food, bars and booming night life .Area in the city center when you can walk in many walking only streets and alleys .Food experience from traditional Cyprus souvlaki, pasta, pits a, burgers,,Lebanese food, Asian food, ice creams ...everything is there",Ledras
10,Greek side were very unpleasant and degrading. Don't interact like humans at all. I advise you to go Ledra palace,Ledras
40,If you are travelling on a foreign passport well worth crossing the very short border to experience life on the other side.........,Ledras
40,"It's a strange one this is. First of all the roads in Cyprus are great it only took us 1 and half hours to drive there from papos. PArking is easy and lots of it. As we entered the centre we went down lots of little streets with shops and bazaars either side and every body says hello.You then come across the green line which is basically a garden shed with 2 guards in it, a small barrier tape and that's it!!! We sat in a cafe oppersite with a choc choc milkshake and I googled why the green line? I was amazed and could not believe it, you walk through the little streets with bazaars and shops selling lace and beautiful hand made dresses and then on to the main street with your big high street stores and then a border crossing. I have (and still am) trying to figure it out, a beautiful city a great island with lovely people torn in too.I have witnessed the Berlin wall coming down and various other historical moments and thought they were in the past back in the 90's, I hope for its people and the country they sort this out.",Ledras
30,Never having been through a country which is divided did not know what to do expect. Having entered in through the Greek side went through the passport control which was very organized and quick. Then going through the Turkish side things were a bit more manual. It's a surreal experience crossing through.,Ledras
40,"Ledra Street is a nice Pedestrian - 99% of the time - area with plenty of Shops, Eateries and Coffee Stops along the street and culminating in the Crossing Point to the North. Manned by both Cypriot and Turkish Police you will need your Passport or ID Card to be checked out of the South and into the North. Fairly quick depending on Tourists and not a difficult experience. Watch your allowances upon coming from North to South.",Ledras
40,"The facade of Ledra Palas hotel was saddening. However there is a UN building in no man's land where you can get a freshly brewed coffee. There are peace volunteers who can tell you the actual situation of peace negotiations. If there will be a peace in Cyprus, it should be preserved as a monument for showing people the real madness and brutality of wars.",Ledras
40,"Crossing is a crossing, both countries had there differences but most weird thing is crossing to Turkish side and it's just the same but with alittle but more red if the Turkish flag, must do tho..........",Ledras
50,Easy crossing just show passport. Shopping trip with the wife for some souvenirs. I like the shirts and the wife likes the jewellery.,Ledras
40,"Goint across to the Turkish side was easy, not much of a queue. The sudden change in surroundings was disorienting - no more signs in greek (or english) and no bright shop fronts!",Ledras
40,"Not so many people in line; the process is really easy and it takes around 1 minute. Especially with a Romanian ID card as we are very well known in the area and always had great relations with them. Feels weird as you walk down to the Turkish part, all gates and doors are very well locked and everything looks deserted for around 50 meters. Make sure to have your travel papers with you; the control is like in any passport control spot.",Ledras
40,"Make sure you have your passport / ID card with you. You walk along a normal shopping pedestrian area, and then in the middle is a Greek border control point. Show your pass, walk 50m though no mans land and then you reach the Turkish Check point. Once through you carry on shopping as before but with a very Turkish feel. You can continue to pay in Euros and the shopping is good :-).",Ledras
50,"Believe or not, one of the main reasons to visit Cyprus was to pass the border which divides one city between to nations.All over the Cyprus side refers to the turkish side as ""occupied territories"" and do me a favor:do not ask the Cypriots about touristic monuments across the border!The crossing went smoothly -you must have a valid passport with you.The Cyprus side does not check on you but the turks do.They register you at the entrance and at the exit.We were in the turkish country for about 5 hours and came back.There is a clear difference betwen the to parts:the turkish is more neglected and not as clean as Cyprus side.Othewise no problem walking and visiting what you had in mind.Even the Venetian Walled medieval Nicosia is divided.The frontier goes almost in the middle. It was interesting to see that the very middle point of the medieval city is in the turkish side and it is mentioned on the touristic map.The Cyprus touristic guides do not mention any attractions in the turkish side so after you crossed the border take a free map of the city and enjoy the event !Just in front of the border before you go to the turks there is a monument in remembrace of the Armenian holocaust done by the turks and denied by them.The monument is put there, I am sure, in a demonstrative act to remind all the tourists and locals about the atrocities done to the Armenian people.",Ledras
50,"It's very nice to walk at this street you feel to be between the past and the future,Many shops and cafe around the area.We enjoy !!",Ledras
10,"The reason for the 1 star is that this crossing is as a result of the division of Cyprus following the Turkish invasion of 1974. It could be argued that at least the crossing allows the movement of people, nevertheless, it's a sad part to Cyprus' troubled history.",Ledras
50,"We decided to go into the north on a Sunday. Arriving in Nicosia we knew to access the car parks for Lidras St we had to enter the city walls. We saw the monument of the boy and drove through there. We found the lidras St underground parking and as I had been told we would be adjacent to mac Donald's. We then turned left and 200m we saw the crossing point. Showed our passports and walked through the eerie area of no mans land. Showing our passports again to the Turkish in the kiosk type offices. It really is that simple. We have travelled all over the world and done huge road trips but for some reason while planning and researching it I felt quite anxious but it really was so simple to navigate.A few tips, you can pick up a free map on a counter of a wooden hut straight after the passport check in Nicosia.After crossing there is a currency exchange immediately on your left. Get your lira here because we didn't see another one ( maybe because it was Sunday) until we got to the Kombos office for the dolmus. We did pay in euro though but was more expensive. If you do park in The underground the ticket machine does not give change!!! It was 5euro ( over 8hrs,4e upto 8)we put 10e in but didn't get our 5 back but hey ho we had a fabulous day out.!!",Ledras
50,"A special place near to point zero of Berlin, before you go there you must find something about it in Wiki.strange place !!! Very interesting to see 50 years back , the other side is there that the time stopped .... really hard to believe that a European capital in under occupation",Ledras
40,Was wondering if it possible for an Iraqi passport holder to cross these borders ? Or it's only allowed for them to stay in the north side ? Thanks,Ledras
50,Thought the crossing into North Cyprus via Ledra St would be more complex but it was very easy and quick.Present passports at South side who scan you through.Present passports at North side who scan you through and give you a 90 day visa.No paperwork and no stamps in your passport.Done!,Ledras
30,"Check point between Cyprus and the Turkish occupied north of Nicosia. The Cypriot side of the line is well developed with modern shops, Starbucks and McDonald's.On the Turkish side the streets narrow and it's immediately obvious that there are cultural difference.Watch out for all the graffiti In the UN zone especially regarding the pointlessness of the UN and the need for a unification.Turkish customs will check passport in detail whilst the Greek side will merely have a quick look at the passport.Turkish Cypriots will accept euros although they try to give you Turkish lira back. Be forceful and insist on euros",Ledras
40,"We went across yesterday with no problems. I recommend it. Have your passport ready. There are some lines to wait in, but everything goes quickly.",Ledras
50,I crossed the border easily. It did not look like a real border. It was so easy to cross it. I was not even sure if I realy passed the border.,Ledras
50,"Note that, unsurprisingly, you need to have your passport out for two different checkpoints, one for the country you're leaving and another for the country you're entering. The people who work the checkpoints range from all business to mildly friendly, and overall, the process is surprisingly painless.",Ledras
40,We went for the day as a friend was specifically looking to buy some knitting wool.The crossing was not busy on either side wen we went through in the morning and it was not at all taking up a lot of time to go through the two checkpoints.The previous time we were required to complete a form but now it is not needed - only passport and other relevant documents eg resident paper or card for Cyprus.,Ledras
30,"This important geopolitical site is located at the end of the main Nicosia pedestrian mall. This crossing point between Greek south-Cyprus and Turkish north-Cyprus is critical to understanding the political reality of this island country. However, there could be more in the way of explanations, signs, maps, historical perspectives, etc. Bottom line: if you're on Ledra Street in Nicosia, walk to the end and see this place.",Ledras
50,"Unlike most people who have written reviews here we used the gate to cross from Northern Cyprus to the south. A lot of those people have, understandably, some kind of agenda. The north is perfectly safe and definitely worth a visit. Crossing is easy for foreigners despite the usual humourless border guards.This crossing is, of course, a sad reminder of a tragic situation, and not a tourist site.",Ledras
40,"Came here ten years ago and of course could not get past Checkpoint Charlie armed patrols. Great to get the chance of seeing what they are trying to do here to attract tourists. Sadly many of the buildings are still in a state of disrepair but plenty of activity going on to improve much of the area. Would have liked to have spent longer on this side but we were on an organised trip that dictated our time. If anyone thinking of going to see Nicosia I would recommend getting a car and giving yourself plenty of time to amble as it is a fascinating place full of intriguing shops on both sides. A ""must do"" if in Cyprus.",Ledras
50,I visit this crossing point often to remind me of what wars do to people. Nicosia is the last divided capital in the world - STILL. part of it is still occupied by the Turkish troops which invaded Cyprus back in 1974. it breaks my heart every time I visit this crossing point. as a visitor you must visit this crossing point so as to have a hands-on experience .,Ledras
50,"Hired a car and drove to Nicosia. Parked in D'Avilla Bastion Car park which was just on the edge of the walled city and a 10 minute stroll to Ledra St crossing point. It worked out about 1 euro per hour parking. The crossing was easy and only took a couple of minutes, had to show passports on southern side and then walked 20 metres or so before showing the passports on the Turkish side. Completely hassle free, same coming back.Visiting the northern side of Nicosia is a must, the atmosphere is more laid back and markedly different to the southern side.",Ledras
50,Simple to cross from one side to the other. Don't forget your passport! Crossed from Greek to Turkish side and back. Allowing 2-3 hrs on the Turkish side should be sufficient. The vibrant difference between the two sides is striking. Must buy yourself a Turkish towel. The Turkish side also sells many inexpensive replicas of well known brand name items.,Ledras
40,"the buffer zone is eerily haunting, crossed fir the experience, the difference between the two sides was remarkable.",Ledras
50,"The northern end of Ledra Street is a pedestrian-only border crossing into the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Between the two passport control is the green zone, a buffer zone of about two hundred meters with totally abandoned buildings. Passport control was quick and I was on the northern Turkish side within minutes which also marked the end of my southern Nicosia sightseeing.",Ledras
50,"You can cross to the Turkish sector by showing your passport to both the Cypriot and Turkish passport control, walk through 100m of no mans land and enter the Turkish sector, its quite incredible that the whole experience of a city can change quite so dramatically in such a short distance. The colours, aromas and sounds are just so different. Well worth the experience. Takes about 5-10 minutes to pass through both passport controls.",Ledras
50,"The Ledras street crossing (lokmatgi street) to the buffer zone was made in 1964 when Turkish Cypriots started rioting against the Legal government and after 1974 when the occupation from turkey stopped there.Connecting the Elephteria square (south) to Kyrenia gate or the woman’s market (north).In 2007 someone eventually decide to open the area.Cypriots from all communities and foreigners except illegal Turkish nationals are allowed to pass from one area to the other by foot.The north decadent, unattended and cheap.The south, normal with plenty of cafés, international brands stores, restaurants etc.Visit with your own caution.",Ledras
40,"It is sad of course that there is a border at all. but under the circumstances, this is the easiest border to cross. Have passport, will cross. Takes less than 5 minutes all together. Let us hope and pray that the border disappears soon. Until then, enjoy this little experience.",Ledras
40,You should try & visit the Turkish side through the crossing point. You will need to show your passport twice upon entering & leaving the Turkish side but this is usually not a problem. There are more shops & places to eat here & where you can buy souvenirs using either your Euros and/or Turkish Lira. You must experience this.,Ledras
50,"My partner is from the Northern side so i find myself crossing 2+ times a week. Always quickly done and never been held up.Late at night they just wave you through, the Turkish authorities are more bothered about the passport checking. But the Cypriot authorities didn't even check my passport.In the height of the summer i would say allow 15 minutes either side to go through the controls.The Turkish side, for me, is alot nicer. The cultural change is something that can only be described when you go there. It's very nice to see everyone talking to each other and not just walking to their destination like it is in the south Nicosia.I'd definitely recommend a day trip to the north, the Turkish baths are a must do, little pricey but worth the money.",Ledras
30,"The crossing between Cyyprus and the Turkish occupied Cyprus was very interesting, walking through no mans land was an eerie experience. The Turkish occupied side was very different and you can immediately sense the difference in culture.Our guide was quite passionate about the events surrounding the occupation and this brought home to us the difficulties experienced by the Cypriots.",Ledras
40,The Greeks don't seem too bothered with passport control but the Turks take it very seriously.Then when you are through you are in a sort of ghost town for a hundred yards.Then some rather underwhelming shops.Interesting experience is the best that can be said.,Ledras
50,This crossing point speaks for its self.Crossing from one side to the other is easy.Just show your passport and away you go.Once on the other side their is lots to see and do.The local shops and bars take both lira or the euro.Forgot passport last year so this year it was a must do.,Ledras
30,"We crossed from Turkish North to the Greek side for a lunchtime visit.Passports are required, and allow 20 minutes both ways.Also Greek time is one hour behind Turkish time....This meant we were asking for lunch at 11am. We were served within a half hour!At An Annama, Ledroa Street which is 150 meters from the border.",Ledras
50,we travelled to nicosia specifically to visit ledra street and to cross the border. Throughly enjoyed by all,Ledras
40,a traditional neighbourhood of Nicosia with narrow winding streets and craft shops. This is also the street to cross over to the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus,Ledras
40,"we have had no problems crossing multiple times, the checkpoint at the ledra hotel is even faster, all u need is your passport or id.",Ledras
50,"Just brilliant just crossing the Turkish side, good restaurants, shopping loads of bargain and worth the experience.",Ledras
40,"This was worth the drive to Nicosia just to experience what the 'green line' is like.Easy passage on foot through the border to the Turkish side and everything changed (except the currency - still Euros), the shops and the Bazaar gave a proper 'eastern feeling' and the people were pleasant - lots of 'snide' gear to be had, Louis Vitton etc..Then we crossed back over without hassle and went for a nice chicken kebab on the Greek side.",Ledras
30,When visiting a country and you know that this is the only divided capital city in the world you want to know the detailsand the reaSONS BEHIND THIS UNACCEPTAB LE SITUATION WITH THE TURKISH TROOPS ILLEGALLYINVADING CYPRUS,Ledras
40,"The crossing was quick and without complications. I crossed on Saturday and back on Sunday - there were no queues. This is a check point, the documents are checked but not stamped on any side. My docs were checked with a friendly smile on both sides, which was appreciated.",Ledras
30,"Is sad this is here but that's what it is, is efficient and grateful it's easy to cross so you can enjoy both parts of this wonderful city.",Ledras
30,Fascinating to think a European capital city is divided. Crossing point isn't actually an attraction. But the crossing process is simple and friendly which is surprising for a UN controlled border into an occupied territory.,Ledras
50,It was a great experience at this place. literally your at the end of the street then suddenly your at the check point between Cyprus and Turkish border. Both officers at the border are very nice.,Ledras
30,crowded border crossing - a necessary evil. The best way to get from Greek Nicosia to Turkish North Nicosia,Ledras
30,"In Nicosia you can visit Ledra street for shopping and eating on the Greek Cypriot side. The street is currently on the up with new shops opening and pleasant sun blinds overhead. This is shopping in the E.U. Should you have your passport available you can continue through to the end of the street to the occupied Territory side of the border. Here you will leave the Greek territory and enter the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus. Expect to pass through both borders, firstly from the Greek Cypriot border guard post to the TRNC border guards. The buildings on this side are in poor condition and little has been rebuilt since the Turkish occupation in 1974. The shopping is for products such as copied designer goods. Clothes, shoes and watches etc plus agricultural hardware shops. You can shop with euros or Turkish money. The Cyprus border guards can confiscate some items such as handbags so do not flaunt them as you return across the two borders. There are a couple of nice restaurants in the TRNC the best, in my opinion around the North side of the huge mosque in a square. The restaurant serves Italian food and they serve good wine and local dishes as well. I think it is called Sabor but it is a cool place. We do go there regularly. All well worth a visit.",Ledras
50,"I was really very excited to experience the Turkish side of Cyprus, it was a splendid experience visiting that side, you can find Halal food on the other side which is so tasty to be experienced.",Ledras
50,they have very nice restaurants with very good food and live music.long distance walks with cafeteries. ypu find a nice confectionary store and you can seat their and have a dring or cakes,Ledras
50,A nice and quiet place to visit with the history of Cyprus to stay there and you can see Nicosia through the history not only from the buildings but and from the whole street and generally the whole area smells tradition and back to the past. Is the point you can see the old side of Cyprus with the new one more Europe.,Ledras
40,Joined a very short line got through very quickly with no problem at all.Interesting to see the different sides & be able to spend time in both.No bag checks just passports.,Ledras
40,"We crossed to the Turkish part of Nicosia and back on Sunday morning. No waiting time, it was still quite early and the atmosphere was sleepy on both sides. It's a very strange experience, to hand in your ID cards to be able to move along a main street in the same town. Note that though there are many streets shown on the maps as passing through the divide, they're barricaded and I believe the Ledra Street is the only place of crossing inside the city walls.",Ledras
10,Nothing to write home about. I don't know why it even exists here as an attraction. In any case look at the photos and judge by yourself.,Ledras
50,"It is incredible how crossing the ""border"" lead you to a breand new city. The procedure over the visa for the turkish part is fast. Once we get on the other side, first we notice the difference in the prices between the european part and the turkish one, after that we appreciated the silence. The small streets were almost empty at 5 p.m. and we could enjoy the atmoshpere. Note that if you buy something like fake clothes from the market, to the way back to the border they may take it from you as it is not legal.",Ledras
40,Que up show your passport to one side then walk 50m to que up to show your passport. Not that well organised.,Ledras
30,"You'll need your passport to cross over to the North. Normally quite quick and easy - although at peak times you could be queuing for 15mins-20mins especially when there's tours. Worth crossing over there's shops a few bars/restaurants and maybe some places of interest to you. There's is a limit to the value of goods you can bring back, I believe its 250 euros per person and certain items you can't bring back i.e. no cigarettes or tobacco or designer items. If you take a chance with these items when you cross back over to the other side more often than not your bags are searched and if you have any of these items they will be taken off you. Just be careful what you purchase. If there is a certain item you are looking to purchase check with the authorities at the crossing first.",Ledras
30,For over 50 years Nicosia and for over 40 years the whole of Cyprus has been forcefully divided by the Turks..Only in the past 10 or so years this crossing points has been opened for passage from and to the Turkish occupied part. Quite a contrast between the two sides of the divided capital,Ledras
30,"Rather shabby experience with uninteresting shacks with bored police and customs officers. Not one smile to share.Not a single ""have a nice time/day""",Ledras
40,"It was good to walk from one country to another. The border police were polite and welcoming - but had a queue on the way back. In the north the streets are narrow and windy. In the south the streets are straight, wide and with modern wealthy shops.",Ledras
40,"Interesting crossing point between Turkish-occupied North Cyprus and Greek Cypriot Republic of Cyprus (South Cyprus). Take your passport to cross over to the other side and feel the difference in cultures. Lots of designer hand bag & clothing shops on the Turkish side (non-original!!), great Turkish pottery (though a bit touristic obviously), carpets and other Turkish trinkets. Not-too-bad reasonably priced restaurants (try the one in the old market place - very nice atmosphere and surroundings).On the Greek Cypriot side you've got some not-too-bad touristy tavernas serving Greek Cypriot food - mezes, grills etc etc, and of course the main thoroughfare in the old town of Nicosia with its shops and cafes - Ledra Street!This used to be closed off completely - with Greek Cypriot armed guards on the Cypriot side of the UN buffer zone separating the two sides, and Turkish guards on their side of the buffer zone, until April 2008 when the barricades were removed.If you are in Nicosia (or indeed in Cyprus), I would say it is a must-see! Happy site-seeing!",Ledras
40,"Interesting experience, as the capital is divided, and a very smooth experience. They might check your bags, but only the bigger ones. We didn't see the military on either side, only the police, who were helpful on both sides. Definitely worth visiting the north side, as it is so much different.",Ledras
30,"I've not been to anywhere like this,as it is pretty unique in Europe.Pretty straight forward,show your passport walk 50 yards or so and show it again to the 'other' side and you're in !There is a big notice warning of illegal items not allowed to be brought into the Greek side , such as fake goods etc.and we did witness bags being checked by police.",Ledras
40,"Despite some border related anxieties and cold wet weather, I wen't ahead with the crossing in this famous location. Absolutely no problems with the authorities on either side. Recommended experience.",Ledras
40,"Ifin cyprus you find yourself in Nicosia this is the easiest walking point to cross to either North or South but be sure to have travel ducuments with you as it is a passport control point. The differences between both sides is immediately apparent..whilst the South offers the trendy coffe shops and stores...the North has the ""bazaar"" style shops and many sites worth visiting within walking distance. The Buyuk Han is a must as it is full of history and has been excellently renovated as is the Mosque where the whirling dervish can be seen performing",Ledras
30,Decided to take a day trip to the North side of Cyprus. We rented a car and ended up parking at Ledra street in old town Nicosia. We walked the border crossing which is certainly something to participate in. Would have loved to see more information on the Green Line and history of events. The crossing is about 25m and little underwhelming. I wish we could see more of the abandoned town. We hired a taxi which then took to the St Hilarion Castle (a must do) and Kyrenia. A beautiful modern area.,Ledras
40,"I crossed over at noon. Very easy. Just bring your passport and note what you must not bring back into Greek Cyprus. Main items not to bring back are the fake designer brand goods. They will be confiscated and destroyed. On my return, there was no customs officer! Just walked by. In any case I had nothing to declare!",Ledras
40,"This area is far less intimidating than the Green Line as it was known in the past.Such a shame that we need a passport to visit our homes in our country.All the might and powers that be EU, can't seem to consider our small, Beautiful and rich culture, bunched up on this island.",Ledras
30,"Crossing the border involved passport control by both the Greek and Turkish authorities, a queue but no long delay. Not much to experience on the Turkish side, a lot of cheap leather and jewelry shops.",Ledras
50,Exploring the old city in Nicosia you find the Ledra crossing point........very interesting the cross over and also visit the other side....,Ledras
50,"Went to Ledra street and to the checkpoint. There was hardly anyone in the queue and just gave the officer my passport. He checked and scanned it and gave it back and then I walked the 50 meters toward the northern side. Here was another passport control officer who took my passport, scanned it and gave it back and hey I was in the north Nicosia. Very easy. No forms to fill or no payment is required.Coming back was similar.",Ledras
40,"The crossing point between Greek Cyprus and Turkish Cyprus gives you a sense that goes back to the East and West crossing of Berling without the sense of danger of past times. The people on both sides are friendly and welcoming and you get to experience sights and traditions of two worlds living next to each other. The crossing felt more a formality than anything else, you walk down the street, have your passport reviewed and continue walking. Same thing on the way back.",Ledras
20,"Nothing special, except that middle in the street you've a control point to cross the frontier to the Turkish part. They control or they don't your passport when you pass the border. A plate tells you that it's the oldest devided capital of the world. Only funny thing is the nearby plate PEACE.",Ledras
40,"I'm saying back to the future because the time zone between ""North"" and ""South"" Cyprus is different. Quite a trip for anyone to visit this side of Cyprus. You will find the true essence of Cypriots. Something lost during the years. The Police on the Crossing, both Turkish and Cypriots were quite polite.",Ledras
50,"As others have mentioned, crossing the line into Turkish Nicosia is like stepping back in time - the nearest equivalent I can think of is possibly visiting Havana. In fact it's quite a shock to cross back again into what then seems the overly commercialised part. This isn't the case in the Turkish part - it's a place for strolling, having coffee and checking out the tiny little shops. We particularly enjoyed the Arabhamet district, the Armenian church and the fantastically grand houses which recall former days.",Ledras
40,"It's very easy to cross from North Cyprus to South or vise versa , it's still the only Capitol that's divided in the world ( as far as I'm aware) it does take you back in time as it's not changed much since 1974 when both sides had there differences shall we say .There's also another walk over crossing called Locmaci more in the centre & goes straight into shops bars etc & if you want to drive a car over you need the Metahan crossing , all 3 you need your passport & if you drive you will need a recognized international driving license and insurance for the car 25 euro a month for the south & about 80 Turkish lire for the North , ( both about £20) this can be paid on a card, there are offices at the border but check open times , I know south side is 9 to 7pm 7 days a week and you will need a tax form for South ( which is free & you will need all car documents ) as well but there only open 9 to 2pm mon to Friday . I'm not sure on the North timings & these times are approx & as I said find out for sure.All 3 are easy to cross, the Locmaci one takes you into the shopping area on both sides with cafe bars etc, on the North you can buy all your branded items very cheap as long as you believe they are branded!! But I've purchased & the items I have bought have lasted years . Shops North side will take euro as well as there lire &. credit cards but South won't take the Turkish lire .All,in all cross and have a look about and do a bit of shopping, just over the Locmaci crossing turn right , walk for 2/3 mins & on the right is a restaurant / bar , go in & have look at the inside , I love the glass floor that has room set out under with Manakins etc, great decor & food is good, also a must is the Buyuk Khan , a centuries old prison with cafe bars art & nick back shops, a great walk around.",Ledras
50,Crossing over at control point now very simple .Walk across and its like stepping back in time.The buildings havē not been renovated since the division in 1974.It is not so commercialised as the south and the shopkeepers and restauranteurs really value your custom.Theer are some lovely churches and other buildings to see .,Ledras
50,"This place is the place with history and feelings.For many it is just a check point, but for many it is a breaking point of the changing history of the city.",Ledras
50,In the middle of winter 2016 this was a very easy crossing to navigate as pedestrians as long as you had your passport or ID card. In fact it is a bit like a bunting strewn garden party entrance if you ignore the gun toting police.The tourist info on the Greek Cypriot side is sparse and empty of anything other than a map of the city (Greek side only of course). However the tourist office on the Turkish Cypriot side tho' small is colourful with useful leaflets and has maps of the whole city -An unexpected reversal. Interesting to note the UN blue beret of the military officer in 'no man's land'.,Ledras
30,"Not really sure how to rate this. An ordinary street in Nicosia. We crossed the border, which is really easy just to say we had.",Ledras
50,"Now have to queue to show your passport on south side, then on north side, pretty quick. Nice you can just walk across, lots of shops and cafes, you cannot buy fake goods and take them back on south side. Just nice for a couple of hours, food is good on northern side, lots of wool shops as its cheaper on northern side, normally buy apple tea which is lovely, also the bread. Also good to see the wurling dervishes, mesmerising.",Ledras
50,"Great spot to cross into Northern Cyprus. Easy border crossing. Great cafes, restaurants and shops. Lots of easy parking on the South side.",Ledras
30,"As my title sounds, this is just a border crossing with some shopping area :) however, it is a place where you can find good shops, food places etc. The same country divided into two... not something nice and acceptable! Anyway... that is what it is and how politics has worked...",Ledras
50,Definitely worth stepping over the green line to see the north side of Nicosia. Recommend going after visiting the observatory to get some background. You need a couple of hours to wander the old wall. You can even walk on it in some places.,Ledras
50,"If there was one and only place to choose from in order to visit during your trip to Nicosia, the Ledra Street Crossing Point is certainly the one. The emotions are mixed as you suddenly realize that you are in a divided city and standing infront of a green zone!",Ledras
40,Well this is an eye opener if you go from the South to the North you will see a dramatic change in the style of two lands in one country. Things are very different in the North not the same development of the South. It is well worth taking a trip to see the different styles of how the people live.The Leora Street crossing is easily done just take your passport you need it.The Leora shopping area leads you right to the crossing and the shops in this area are great and a good deal can be had.Don't forget to try the Turkish coffee a must if your in Cyprus,Ledras
40,"The crossing is quick and efficient and a few minutes later was entering Northern Cyprus.. This is the foot crossing point, and was advised that can be bush at certain times of day. But when I crossed it was quiet and efficient.",Ledras
40,"By crossing from the Greek Cypriot South to the Turkish occupied North of Nicosia you move between 2 unique and different worlds; the lively, colourful, commercial and well developed Ledra Street and the historic, undeveloped and boring North; especially that you have to go there walking; vehicles are not allowed.Visiting the two sides is certainly interesting.",Ledras
40,Well worth a visit. Crossing from the republic of Cyprus into the North. You can see the old churches and the new mosks. Salamas ruins are a must see the best in Cyprus and the walled city of Famagusta,Ledras
40,Here you can cross on feet from the Greek part of the island to the northern part of Cyprus (Turkish Cyprus). You only have to show an ID card or a passport. Coming back there is strict control by the customs,Ledras
50,stopped here for a coffee on several occasions. great spot.good service and great staff good sandwiches and always sunny,Ledras
40,How can you rank a checkpoint? It's not often you get to walk back and forth through a UN controlled demilitarised zone while still in (on one side at least) Europe.,Ledras
50,We were undecided if it would be a good idea to visit based on reviews but so glad we did! We have British passports and had absolutely no problem crossing the border at all and didn't take any longer than 5 minutes. I was extremely interested in the fake designer bags and wasn't disappointed. The quality of fakes is amazing and the choice is great. You can also barter which we did! As long as you then use the bag when you leave and take all the tags off there is no issue. There is a completely different atmosphere over on the north side. Everyone is super friendly and the streets are very authentic and really pretty. I'm so glad we went and recommend it anyone that is ok Nicosia. Enjoy,Ledras
50,"Ledras street is my favorite place from all Cyprus. Have many shop for everything, relaxing atmosphere .",Ledras
50,"A must do if you are in Nicosia. Very strange to walk through no mans land between the Greek side to the Turkish side. I found the North side actually more interesting than South, where it is a bit commercial and boring. The Turkish side had more historic sites to see and the people seemed more friendly to me. I had a lovely day wandering around.",Ledras
30,A bizarre situation to behold as you walk down the street and see this crazy pedestrian crossing point from Greece to the Turkish side of Cyprus passport required to go and return with the usual sad faced officials the other side of the glass in run down huts. Oddly enough it's hard to resist going over but not a lot to see . You will need Turkish lira to spend but some take euros.,Ledras
40,"In your face divided Nicosia, frightful no man's land, easy to negotiate but hard to see. Very helpful tourist information just through the border. Get some Turkish Lira at the bank; things are much cheaper in lira",Ledras
30,"fairly long line for process but went quickly, I had heard the authorities give hassle coming back to south but none at all good to go for pint of Efys beer",Ledras
30,"A clear indication of the intransigence that still exists on Cyprus. A simple way of visiting the north part of Nicosia, but would you wish to do so.",Ledras
30,"Good idea to cross into 'North Cyprus'. Need to take your passport. The Turkish side is quite different, less lively, very Turkish. You get a different perspective of Nicosia",Ledras
40,"Beyond any doubt, it is a sad reality of a life divided in two.Nonetheless border control is fast, and you have the opportunity to visit the northern part of Nicosia which is so different,Still, hopefully this sad reminder of division and war would be removed in the nearest possible future",Ledras
50,"This is a great street to visit in Nicosia. Lots of great shops and heaps to see and plenty of wonderful places to eat and or have coffee. There is a wonderful observation point at the entrance to which is adjacent to H&M. Great view of the city and an excellent video explaining the history of the place. Ledra Street is great to visit day or night, but especially at night with all the wonderful restaurants and nightlife, music and people. A must see for Cyprus.",Ledras
40,"We went from the north to the south,very easy and quick,the buffer zone still has the ghosts of past glorious houses,slowly falling into decay,after sampling the obvious greater array of lifestyle in the south we returned through another crossing point back to the north.",Ledras
40,"It's a little sad to see the crumbling buildings in the green zone, but as a means of getting from the southern to the northern part of the city, it works.",Ledras
40,"We were in the vicinity of Ledra Street Crossing Point during our sightseeing visit on a Friday in late September and found the whole historical content fascinating. Unfortunately despite our great intentions to use the crossing and visit the northern section of Nicosia we discovered we had left our passports back in the hotel in Protaras - schoolboy error. However, we did benefit from being able to walk on the southern side of the Green Line that divides the city, past the old Ledra Palace Hotel, no a UN Army Barracks and down the city centre sides street and view all the Greek, Turkish and UN observation posts.Living History was experienced and as someone who was living in Berlin in 1989 when the wall came down, could only appreciate what now remains the final divided capital city in the world today.Certainly worth a visit and please remember your passports if you wish to complete the crossing from one zone to the other.",Ledras
40,Whilst at a conference in Nicosia I had the opportunity (with a group of other people) one evening to cross the border from the south side of the city to the north which is the Turkish part. It is a really interesting experience - there is a demilitarised zone in between which is patrolled by UN soldiers (although I didn't see them in this zone - I did see them travelling around other parts of the city on the south side). The crossing itself didn't take long - passports had to be checked at both sides and there were some queues (the locals don't seem to bother with queuing and just move forward ignoring the tourists). Once on the northern side it is very touristy and it does feel a little eerie & rundown - but the people are friendly and I think it was safe enough. I went through again a few days later during daytime and had a better look around.,Ledras
40,"Strange location for a border crossing, its literally in the middle of a shopping street with a no mans area in the middle, nice to see things are improving allowing all to pass both ways, if going from Turkish side to the Greek side be careful not to try to take fake goods in as they are taken from you there and then",Ledras
40,"We felt we ought to make the crossing, having never been to Nicosia before, and if you blink, you will miss the section of no-man's land between Turkish Cyprus and the Greek Cyprus. The border crossing was swift, and we walked into the main street. i wanted to go to the museum up on the 11th floor of Debenhams, although it is now H&M! The view is good and the time line of history useful, but you actually see the divide, which I had been led to believe you could.",Ledras
30,My goodness but it took a while to cross from the Turkish side to the Greek! It reminded me of Berlin in the 80s. I suppose we ought to be grateful we can cross.,Ledras
40,We crossed the border from and back to the Greek side of Nicosia and spent only 20 minutes on the northern part of the city. The crossing takes about two minutes and it's really no big deal.,Ledras
50,"As a Cypriot living in the country for the past 6 years, I strongly believe that to be able to say that you have really seen Cyprus, you need to cross the checkpoints. We wish they weren't there, but they are and it is essential to see visit the North and the South to comprehend the clash of cultures, the history and legacy of our island.This is probably the best point for pedestrians who wish to cross and immediately experience the ""other side"" of Nicosia.The process is not as scary as some might assume, and it has been simplified over the past years. Make sure to have your passport, show it when requested, do not take any photos in the buffer zone, and ask the G/C police at the gate for information regarding what goods you can bring back. That's about it.At the entrance, there is an exhibition hall that often hosts photographic or art exhibitions, and as you cross you will pass a line of small olive trees - symbols of peace.Once in the North, look at the signs about where to visit, there are also maps available early in the checkpoint. I suggest going to Buyuk Han or Hoi Polloi, for a meal or coffee and ask locals there for recommendations on what to visit next. If you haven't gone too far, you can always follow the blue line on the floor to get back to the checkpoint. :)",Ledras
50,When you pass borders you feel like you turn back in time. Time stopped there. You are entering a ghost town. Nicosia before war in 1974. Greek side and Turkish invaded side. So sad,Ledras
50,"The people, the coffee, the experience of being on the green line -- all vastly exceeded my already high expectations.",Ledras
40,"This brings home the reality of the division and you put your camera away before, during and until yuo are out of the buffer zone.",Ledras
40,"Passports Or I.D card have to be shown and the information put into the computer, But beware British citizens that live in Cyprus because they will not accept your Cypriot I.D. card and you must produce your British passport at the customs.It is a good crossing point as there are shops both sides",Ledras
30,"It is a shame that this tourist attraction is based on political division. It is a vibrant and thought provoking place to be. To go through you will need your passport as it is the point of exit and entry to the Greek and Turkish controlled areas of Cyprus and is worth the effort. I did not spend a long time but just saw a snapshot of the other side as it was not my prime motive for being in the area, however I found the sight and experience well worth my detour and recommend it for a visit if you have two or three hours to spend. Just don't forget that this is the outward sign of a divided island and it would be better consigned to history and the island re-united.",Ledras
40,"We were staying in Nicosia and we went across into Northern Cyprus twice in two days. Just remember your passport. You may need a little patience as there were queues at the Turkish side, but we only waited five minutes. It's certainly a simple procedure",Ledras
40,"Generally, Ledra Street is a very nice place to visit; full of stores and historical places. The crossing point separates Cyprus than North Cyprus, which is a nice place to visit as well. Notice that you can cross easily!",Ledras
40,Well we stumbled across it purely by accident while in Nicosia on a trip from Laranca however we were unable to go across due to not having our passport's with us.There seemed to be very little in the way of a queue on one side but there was a queue on the other side coming back.,Ledras
30,Easy crossing area but if it is sunny you may need protection as you may have to queue for 15 minutes.,Ledras
50,Experience to do.No problem if you go in Northern Cyprus with your passport.North Cyprus is very nice to visit,Ledras
50,A landmark that must be visited for all Greeks that visit Cyprus. A tribute to all those who lost their lives defending the island's freedom.,Ledras
40,"Crossing the border between the Greek and the Turkish part of Nicosia feels quite surreal. Passport control is fairly quick and smooth - no stamps or visas or pieces of paper are given to you though.Once you are in North Nicosia, the Turkish part, the atmosphere is very different from what at the other side of the border: less touristic, quieter, with lots of narrow alleys and run down buildings. Beautiful experience.One thing to remember as you cross the border: while Greek Nicosia is included in cheap roaming/mobile data plans valid across Europe, Turkish Nicosia isn't. So switch off roaming and data as you cross the Ledra Street border or you'll get hefty charges for your smartphone usage!",Ledras
40,"This is the main crossing point in central Nicosia between the turkish and greek sides of the city. It straddles 'The Green Line' an arbitrary border defined by an English Colonel using his child's green crayon during the civil war mid-twentieth century. The turkish side of the city is quaint and old, the greek modern and featureless. The same shops ppulate 'Murder Mile' as in any other cosmopolitan european town. But the greek side is dearer to buy refeshments.",Ledras
50,"The short walk between the Greek and Turkish borders at Ledra Street is a real experience. You need your passport but the formalities are short, particularly on the Greek side. There is something chilling about crossing the Green Line between the two still disputing sides. A must do in Nicosia.",Ledras
30,It was good to cross the border just through walking !!!But sad to see the invaded part and emptied areas !!!,Ledras
40,"Visiting lydras Street quite often. I always love the way everything is set, shops, cafes, shisha, bars and food around. Great area to visit if you are in old Nicosia and spend some time. If you do have a passport with you, can be used to cross on foot to northern side",Ledras
50,"I hope the Ledra Crossing is kept intact as a testament to the tumultuous history between the two Greeks and Turks in Cyprus. Set in the middle of the long stretch that formed Makrifdromos (Long Road) now at the end of northern Ledra Street It has been spruced up since I last saw it with all the photographs of the Greek missing of the 1974 war gone. The monument is still an important and relevant feature as it's almost at what is the bellybutton of Cyprus, central Nicosia.",Ledras
50,"We visited in September 2016 and after getting past the passport checks (which were easy and painless). You arrive into the northern side and it has beautiful areas and quite streets to wonder around. Prices on this side are a lot cheaper and everywhere takes euros. We got some great spices and teas. Plenty of shopping, places to sit and people watch. Mosques, church and a restored area called Buyuk Han are a must to stop for a visit.",Ledras
20,".There is hardly anything worth saying about a politically artificial crossing except for expressing unhappiness at the state of affairs. Nicosia is a divided capital and the boundary checkpoints on the same Ledra Street are a reminder that all is not well in an otherwise peaceful Mediterranean country. No undue fuss is made by the officials on either side, albeit strict procedures are in place, documents are thoroughly checked, and the odd question asked. Yes, it is amazing how just across a dividing line in the self-same street one can immediately notice a change of scene.",Ledras
40,"History in the middle of the present. A monument at the end of a bustling area for shopping , eating or drinking coffee wakes you up to what really happened here. A dead end into no mans land.Turn your back on this and your back to Modern day Cypriot relaxation.....",Ledras
50,"If your in Nicosia, then you must take a walk down Ledra street. Its got just about every thing regards shopping. Clothes, shoes, restaurants,bar's and of course the Border crossing should you want to cross over to the Turkish sector. Be warned though, should you buy anything with a designer label, they'll confiscate it unless you wear it under your other clothes as other's do.",Ledras
50,"Ledra looks charming with many restaurants,cafes and shops all around the year.There are still orange trees at some places around Debenhams store.Crossing point is place where is possible to enter at north part of the country followingsimple procedure with Turkish immigration which sometimes can be very slow due tobig crowd.After the border almost nothing to be impressed, time stopped forty years ago.There was no rush on the way back to Greek part.",Ledras
30,its a shame that this point exists but that's life you can go over the border its very busy and if hot rather draining if the queue is long the main street if very alive and I would say worth a visit but do not keep to the main streets go off down the side streets to get the real atmosphere,Ledras
30,"If there are a lot of tourists, this can be tiresome as both the Greeks and Turks now scan all passports. If the sun is hot or it is raining there is very little shelter from the heat or the wet. If all desks on both sides are manned then it can all be quite quick.",Ledras
40,I use this crossing to buy towels etc and drugs which are far cheaper across the border. Strictly speaking counterfeit goods can be confiscated but in my experience a single handbag or towel seems to be accepted by the Cyprus police. The TRNC police seem to be pleased that you are going in to spend!,Ledras
50,While you are walking up the ledras street eventually the road is blocked. The rest of the city is illegally occupied by the Turkish Cypriots. Fortunately you can unwind a bit at the cafe yiayia Victoria and have something refreshing. A must go though.,Ledras
40,We are on holiday in Cyprus and decided to go over the crossing at Ledra street. It was an experience felt really nervous but everything was fine. It was strange to see how different things were on the other side. Prices are cheaper for goods but luckily a woman told us to be careful what we buy as it could get taken of us when we went back through the crossing. Had a good day I'm glad we did it. Definitely would recommend. It's quite an experience being so close to the green line as well you can still see bullet holes in a lot of the walls. Not to mention the guards that stand there with guns. That was a little frightening.,Ledras
40,No effort getting across. Coming from the South we showed our passports to the agent and then over the crossing (a few steps) to the Turkish official. Both were friendly and it took about 4 minutes total.Worth the trip. We walked around the neighborhood and then headed back. A shame that the island remains divided. Though not as modern as the Southern side it is worth the trip to see the other part of Cyprus.,Ledras
50,"You can't have a holiday in Nicosia without visiting both sides. Good for shopping and culture. Sad to see the country split like that but interesting to observe how the separated neighbours from different cultures, religion and language still get on so well.",Ledras
40,Pleasant staff on hand to help you cross. Remember your passport. It's only a few metres to walk across,Ledras
40,"Interesting place to visit. Being able to cross the border just in 5 min showing the pas, it' interesting. Made a bit of shopping on Turkey side :).............",Ledras
50,Ωραία was a beautiful afternoon in Ledra Street Nicosia Cyprus if you want a special day you mast see and test the nice restaurant at the end of Ledra Street Nicosia Cyprus,Ledras
50,I crossed from the Greek to the Turkish side and back really fast. They just scan your passport and let you in.,Ledras
40,The crossing from Nicosia into Northern Turkey through no mans land is quiet spooky. Go by foot as you can see the old buildings that have stood still in time. Very eerie!!,Ledras
40,"The last devided city in Europe, how sad is that.It is a sample of today's politics when other countries mess around little week countries like this one.",Ledras
40,"Highly recommend seeing and experiencing this, the bazzar on the Turkish side is worth some time. The history and story behind the divided island is sobering.",Ledras
50,"the easiest border crossing i've ever experienced, you just show your passport on both the greek and turkish cypriot check point and easily move to the other part of the city .",Ledras
50,"One minute you're wall to wall in fake designer bags, clothes, shoes and sun glasses next you're in McDonald's!It's a weird set up but worth a trip if not just for the cheap and some very good fake designer shops.",Ledras
50,Show your passport and off you go. Please adhere to signs telling you what is forbidden to be brought into cyprus as we watched a group of people have all their fake goods taken off them as they tried to get back into the republic of Cyprus. There are lots of fake goods to buy on the north side but it is forbidden to bring them back.,Ledras
40,"This is the main crossing point between Southern and Northern Cyprus, and is highly recommended as a unique border experience - walking through the UN controlled zone is interesting in itself, as is comparing Southern and Northern Nicosia. Remember to bring your passport and check in advance for any other travel requirements.",Ledras
50,The capital of Cyprus Nicosia is the only capital divided in two parts in Europe. If you have entered the country from Republic of Cyprus it makes no difference what your nationality is. So give a try cross over and take a look of the other half of the country but dont forget to take your passport with you otherwise you have no chance to do so.....,Ledras
50,"This is the last divided city, and with the help of locals or some more information online you can understand what happened in this country, and it is worth going to the other side just to admire the difference in cultures present in the city.",Ledras
40,"It's very busy but the shopping here is just ok,I'm not a fan.There is more eateries than good clothing stores and bars at nightIf you like the better quality clothing this is not really the place to go",Ledras
40,"I visited this location 34 years ago. There was little to see other than armed soldiers, barbed wire and a boarded up blockade. On our most recent visit to Nicosia I walked down Ledra Street which was pretty much as I remembered, a bustling main shopping street. But on approaching the 'green line' crossing point all has changed. Gone the barbed wire, gone the armed soldiers, gone the barricades and most noticeable, gone the tension in the air. The atmosphere is relaxed and all that's there is a memorial called ""Resolution"" (Civil Rights Monument), a police station/office, some plastic tape showing where to queue to fulfill passport formalities and a poignant sign reminding you this is a divided city. Not spectacular, but worth seeing.",Ledras
40,"You can literally shop till you drop here, there are so many lovley shops most with great prices so you can pick up some good bargains, and there are lots of eating places to choose from so you can keep your energy levels up for more shopping",Ledras
50,"I travelled from Larnaca to this place to check on "" the last divided capital in the world"".Yes, it is only a street with a police check before leaving the southern part and another one before entering the northern part but it is a piece of history. I had the opportunity to cross borders in Berlin, before the wall's destruction and it feels kind of the same although the situation is not as dramatic. Beware as the Cypriots are very sensitive about the issue: a few persons to whom I was asking my way declined to "" understand "" ( do not tell them that there are two countries )",Ledras
40,Crossed over very easily without any fuss- with Greek id. Sad to see the green neutral area so deserted!!! It only took 2 minutes to have id checked !!!,Ledras
20,"This is actually nothing special to see on LS Crossing Point. It's just one of checkpoints for a identity control between Turkish and Greek side of the Cyprus, but here you can only walk between two sides. As it was expected on TK side offecers were more lazy and TK side is more dirty. But if you are in Nicosia, you must see this since there are some nice restaurants on the TK side (cheaper then Greek side) and Selimiye Mosque is really close to check point .. so ... the its the best way to to get to the mosque.",Ledras
30,"Always busy , very scruffy , rather restricted , as there really is no space to move. Not their fault., as Ledra Street is very narrow. First time visited felt nervous going to the TC side.i object to some of the comments posted here, that they behave like spoilt children' not resolving the situation. Suggest people read the history of this troubled enslaved island.",Ledras
30,"This is actually nothing special to see as it is a identity control to access either the Turkish or the Greek part of the city. The special thing about is that Nicosia is the only European capital which is divided in two parts, so it is the only place where you can see this. There are gates in the whole city. Between the Turkish control and the Greek control there is 100 meters of ruines that belong to nobody. Realy strange! You must have seen this when visiting Nicosia",Ledras
50,"Kedar Street Crossing Point has many shops, restaurants, cafes. Great destination for tourist. You get to see both sides of Cyprus....South and North. You will also see both Greek and Turkish cultural influences, depending on which side of the crossing point you are. This is a must see destination in Cyprus!",Ledras
50,"Some of the reviews of Ledra Street Crossing Point on here are ridiculous and are more political statements than information for travellers. We travelled to Nicosia and were keen to experience the North of the city. Crossing from South to North was straightforward - two posts, one to leave the south, the other to enter the north. Coming back was slower coming into the south, so you might have a short queue. Each time, the border staff were friendly, and it was worth seeing the different culture in the north. Worth also mentioning most places sell in Euros if that's all you're carrying, and there are plenty of shops and things to see.",Ledras
40,"it was an experience, very daunting getting passports checked at two different points but two different enforcement officers after a 2 min walk.Nothing flash, but dont go on the 20th ~July they have a big demonstration about the North south divide!",Ledras
20,"The last divided city in the world and you would think both sides would do something to make this crossing better for those who wish to see the other side of life. Since security is now a massive problem for the west the Cypriots decided to check every passport apart from the Cypriots that is so in the winter you can stand in the rain for long periods and in the summer well just forget it, 45 dg and what you see in the picture is the only shade, people pushing in, not organized at all and when you do decide to come back beware if you have purchased any copies of goods as they will be confiscated or you land up paying tax.",Ledras
40,"We crossed the border with our passports. Much easier than it used to be, going and coming back.We noticed how much smarter it is once we crossed over. Some good restaurants too.",Ledras
50,Very relaxed crossing. Open 24/7. Both sides are very polite and friendly. Interesting experience to cross a check point in a shopping street.,Ledras
20,"walked up to crossing point , street itself is full of rather tired looking shops and closed up fronts . Check point Charlie in Berlin had more character and was more interesting to visit than this area where 2 mediterean countries act like spoiled bullies on someone else's playground .",Ledras
30,We traveled back and forth multiple times. Each time was different pending whether the computers recognized our passports.,Ledras
50,"lots of copies ect over the line, but the prices would tell you that anyway. cheap. lacoste pumps 5 euros, not bad quality .",Ledras
50,A tremendous bit of history. A great way to get a snap shot of Turkey on the other side and an opportunity to view (only) the plethora of fake goods on offer. The indoor market and Buyuk Han well work a gander.,Ledras
10,"I was on a cruise which stopped in Cyprus for the day. We were told by Royal Caribbean NOT to take our passports off the ship. We booked the trip to Nicosia for the experience of going to both sides of the border and to see the sights. After taking a tour through the cruise line, we end up at the border in Nicosia. We were not allowed entry as we did not have our passports. After much negotiating by the tour guide, we were allowed in if we had a driver's license, but the license had to stay with the border authorities. This cut into the tour time by over an hour. When we left of course our documents were not at the border and we were not allowed to leave. Another hour went by and finally the guard who let us in arrived back with our documents on him. This cut into our shopping and wandering time, two hours wasted at the border. we had 15 minutes to shop and use the restroom then back to the bus. What a disaster of a trip and the return bus ride back to the port we were in an accident. It had started to rain and the driver was trying to make up time by speeding and we hydroplaned and were hit by three vehicles, a car, a truck, and another bus. Take your passport or skip the journey all together, as it turned out to not be that interesting. If you have seen one Mosque, you do not have to see this one, just like visiting all the churches in England.",Ledras
50,"I was traveling with and American passport and just passed into N. Cyprus to walk around Nicosia for a few hours and it only took me 5 minutes going from south to north and 15 minutes going from north to south. I went mid-day so it may be busier at other times. If you're just sticking to the border area you may not need local currency, many of the places were accepting euros.",Ledras
50,"It seems odd to rate a checkpoint. So, let's consider this a ""Gateway."" Whichever community you're coming from, you've simply got to visit the ""other side."" After the 1974 war, the populations were moved (Greek-speaking south, Turkish-speaking north), often into each others' vacated homes. The UN has been maintaining the Buffer Zone since 1974 -- except for diplomats, the borders were closed. In 2003, crossing points started opening and for the first time in 29 years, Cypriots could visit their old villages and neighborhoods. The Ledra Street/Lokmachi Street crossing opened in 2008. As of 2016, travel between the communities has gotten very much easier. I've been crossing since 2008, and the crossing is pretty smooth now, even if there are large crowds. Even though you show a passport or identity card, calling this a ""border"" is hotly political to some, since it implies that there is a recognized, sanctioned division between what should be a single entity: Cyprus... rather than Turkish North and Greek South.That's politics. One either side of the Green Line, you'll find wonderful, warm people with some very similar traditions and culture (Cypriot), and interesting ethnically-based cultural differences. It's definitely worth your time to visit the communities on both sides of the Green Line.",Ledras
30,Visited on a Sunday and still quite busy. The Turkish side not as good IMO although to be fair the local bazaar was closed. Interesting walking from one side to the next and seeing a glimpse of the green line with some of the buildings in disarray although it was clear work was being done to restore part of it. All told not something to visit specifically for but interesting if you are in the area. Shops/Restaurants on Greek Cypriot side much better IMO.,Ledras
50,"I thing besides the numerous shops for drinks and food it truly worth to see the border on the divided and invaded city. You will literally see coffee shops separated in half, the front door on the south Cyprus and the backdoor in the occupied area. You can try to cross if that what you wish, have a passport ready.",Ledras
40,"A nice city walk, plenty of choices for restaurants, taverns, street food, coffee shops, la pasterias, pizzas, souvlaki, seftalies, Mezedes, ice cream shops, bars, etc. a must visit city place",Ledras
40,"It is odd to be required to show your passport while walking along a shopping street. Yet it is somehow reassuring to see in what a relaxed, even bored, way this ""conflict"" is handled. Still, I would have liked a stamp in my passport (you don't get it). On the Turkish side, be prepared to encounter some tourist trap shops of the finest kind just next to the checkpoint.",Ledras
30,It's good to learn and know things but really I felt sad on Cyprus and thought why ppl are sometimes crazy go there learn about what happened and be part of it a city u need a passport to go to the other part of it worth being there let's hope for love and peace,Ledras
50,"Quite surreal to be walking down a shopping street and see a border crossing!Take your passport with you! If you have a Turkish spouse, have been married for more than two years and you were married in Turkey, take your 'aile cuzdani' with you and they let your Turkish spouse pass through the border with you no problems.",Ledras
50,Walking down the paved ledra street you can easily cross to the other side and visit the shops there. its interesting as Nicosia is the only devided city in Europe.,Ledras
40,"So strange to be on this point. A city divided, you need a passport to cross the line. And nowadays it is a mere formality only. So do cross that line and visit the other side, it is worth it.",Ledras
50,"Best point!! to see your friends ,near from bus station if you like to go to another town if you like !!",Ledras
50,"It just had to be done. Crossing over from the Turkish to the Greek side, and vice versa, was really easy, no problem at all. Worth it to see the contrast between the two sides. Unfortunately, it was pouring with rain while we were there as it would have been nicer to have spent more time taking it all in.",Ledras
40,"Visiting both sides of divided Cyprus is so easy now,a short walk along its main street LEDRA STREET brings you to border crossing,passports,fill in paper,get stamp and your across usually in 5 minuets,enjoy the cheap,resteraunts,shops,super exchange rate compared with uk rates all in north,you can even buy euros,better raytes but check first.Good food as you cross.TRY it its so easy.",Ledras
40,At the end of a street of shops and cafes the crossing is a foot only one and very easy to cross with passports or I.D cards. We stay in the Turkish side of Cyprus and have not used this yet but will do so in the future,Ledras
40,A place / str in the centre of Nicosia that you have to visit. Its the place that connect the two sides and gives you the opportunity to visit nice shops and restaurants of the area. For sure will visit again.,Ledras
50,Very quick and easy to cross over into the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus and back just show passports and depending on which country you are from some quicker than others. We were waved through as soon as they saw our UK passports without even opening them. This is a foot crossing only and you can go across for an hour or two or for a longer stay.,Ledras
40,"We did the crossing over the border today. Found it all a little bazaar (pardon the pun) seems so strange to walk down a busy shopping street then all of a sudden at the bottom of the street is the ""serious"" border crossing. No problems to pass (either side) with your passport of course but quite alien to someone who hasn't experienced such a thing. Once over the border (sounds stupid) it really is like being In a different country. Great for shopping if that's your thing also plenty of lovely looking historic buildings and churches etc. All in all well worth the experience of crossing the last capital border crossing in the world.",Ledras
40,"If like us you are traveling by foot and want to see the north of Cyprus then this is a good place to cross. You must have either a Cypriot ID card (new type) or as in our case, a passport.",Ledras
50,"Great shopping strip full of cafes , shops and restaurants.Excellent place for a frappe whilst people watching with wi- fi available everywhere.",Ledras
50,It's a very nice place to walk and there is plenty of small cafes and bars in there for rest and gathering. I definitely loved this place. I used to walk everyday and pass everyday on this street.,Ledras
40,So glad we did this. Locals say it won't be around much longer!! They obviously know something we don't! Easy... Just present your passport.. Don't try and engage in conversation though!,Ledras
40,"Easy enough to navigate - walk towards the booths and show your passport to each side's guards. No issues or questions asked, locals seem to be crossing the border regularly a number of times a day.",Ledras
50,"It is now far easier to cross than on previous visits to this fascinating and vibrant city. In 1987 the atmosphere was very tense but during visits in 1998 and 2004 relations eased but this was the first time I had actually crossed. The atmosphere was relaxed and the Turkish control staff far more friendly than most such officials I have met- not that their Greek counterparts were in any way unprofessional. They have the added difficulty in that good are more likely to move north to south where prices are higher and counterfeit goods are not freely available. As you walk the 100 metres between respective border posts you can get a view of no man's land ( no photo signs are clear), deserted since 1974.There is a massive difference between the 2 sides of this fascinating city and seeing both parts of this walled city is strongly recommended - just don't forget your passport. As long as you have the legal right to be on either side there are no problems and you don't need to purchase a Turkish visa.People on both sides of the border are very pleasant and happy you are spending time (and money) with them.It is not the scope of such a review to discuss the political issues around the divide, only to hope relations will continue to improve to the point there is no border. However, go now - I would not have missed Berlin in the 1980's for anything even though it is a far better city now .",Ledras
40,"This is a place to go in cyprus, nicosia is the last town where there is a crossing point and a border in a capital city. You can walk through the old town with small street and find very nice patio to get a drink close to this crossing point. this is an important place for nicosia/lefcosia and from my point of view, necessary to visit to understand the mood of the town.",Ledras
40,"This is simply a crossing-point from the Greek section of Nicosia (and Cyprus) to the Turkish section. First you submit your passport on the Greek side (or vice-versa), and then on the Turkish side. No hassle. Crossing the barrier gives you an immediate sense of the difference between the two cultures.",Ledras
40,"We found it very easy and quick to cross at Ledra. The guards on the Turkish side were friendly and helpful. Note that once the sun goes down, little remains open on the Turkish side unless you are prepared to wander further in past the market area. Worth a visit to watch a whirling dervish, see some lovely old architecture including the old bazaar and the 12th century mosque. Felt safe, even at night when it was very quiet.",Ledras
40,Great place to visit and cross the green line into the occupied side of Cyprus to be able to see the two cultures side by side and great shopping also.,Ledras
10,"The checkpoint which divides the Northern part of Nicosia from the Southern part. You need an id card or a passport to go from one part to another. It takes less than a minute to cross it. At the moment there is nothing to see really, but i think it will be a major landmark once the whole country is reunited.",Ledras
40,"On both sides when going and returning the checking was smooth. I wished to get a stamp in my passport, but no luck. So I had to by the fridge-door-magnet.",Ledras
50,The border guards on both side were very polite but stern. Probably not a good place to joke around or be jovial. There was more choice in shopping on the Greek side. But all were pleasant.,Ledras
20,"The crossing is really just a small booth and a sign. The street is beautiful (especially the crossing alleys) but all in all - nothing more than a street with stores.walked and passed it within 20 minutes.TIP - parking is hard to find, you'll need to pay to park in a parking lot (guess they're not 'legally licensed').",Ledras
40,"You will need a passport, and the crossing is easy to do from North to South or from South to North. There is ease of crossing, and the number of times I have done this, I have never been stopped to have my bags searched. The atmosphere is relaxed and there is no tension and it is a nice thing to do. There are different shops, on the South there are some of the well known shops Macdonalds, Holland and Barret, I believe there is a new H & M opening soon, and plenty more. On the North side, there are many quaint shops, make sure you visit the Buyuk Han, within a couple of minutes walk from the crossing and plenty of places to eat and drink. Also visit the small covered market for gifts etc.",Ledras
50,"If you are a tourist you have to visit ""the other side"" of the City. You can feel the tense of what happened some years ago. You can notice the difference between two totally different cultures and people. worth a visit!!!",Ledras
40,"We took a trip here for a change of seenary. It's a bit eary in the surrounding areas as there is what I would describe a s a no mans land between the two sides with sand bags and oil drum blocking the streets. We made the crossing and went into the Turkish side but noticed on the way through the Cypriots we're stopping people on the way back and checking bags, if you have any contifit goods you will be fined or have the goods seized so be careful, in all a good day out just hope on day they might come to an agreement and open up all borders.",Ledras
50,Lots of fun shopping plenty of bartering and some nice food and beer of course old market has lots of lovely traders and plenty of things to see car parking is a bit hit and miss but free if you over sixty,Ledras
30,"Take your passport if you're crossing the border into the northern side. Different scene there and I enjoyed seeing both sides. Shops selling food, shoes, trinkets, jewelry, and lots of restaurants. Markets on the northern side were fun to stroll through.",Ledras
40,"Quaint area to just stroll along or sit and have a meal or drink - plenty of places to choose from, especially on the Greek side.",Ledras
40,"Its a nice architectural point, old buildings, old market with old and new shops. Its worth a visit, a ride with the train or bike, be sure to visit the local church, have some ice-cream and local delicacies like souvlaki or gyros. There are some brand stores for shopping as well and everything is really close (on foot) with a very large parking area at the ""old city gates"" or ""tafros"" as the locals call it.",Ledras
40,Ledra street the main street in old nicosia.A street full of bars restaurants cafes shops a nice place to stroll down.Make sure you venture off down the side streets and see a little more of the city.Also you can now visit the turkish side of the city.Just make sure you have your passport if you wish to do so.,Ledras
20,"We liked the multicultural flavor of the trip, the friendly people on both sides and the vaguely exotic atmosphere.Sadness however sets in rapidly. One can't drive to the other side (which must be beautiful), can't freely buy and bring back stuff to this side, get searched, has to show passports four times etc...Independent of which side one stands for, seeing barb wire fences and demilitarized zones right in the heart of Europe in 2016 is unsettling and in hindsight I regret exposing our kids to this poor show.",Ledras
50,"Just around the corner is an attractive, lively coffee bar with a backdrop of dividing wall topped by barbed wire. Incredible sight.Possible to walk along the streets at the side of the dividing border which is also interesting.If you want to walk across into Northern Nicosia and return you MUST have your passport with you.",Ledras
40,"This certainly a tale of two cities, the Cypriot side is a very modern upbeat street with suspended sun screens which is very nice in the blazing sun, the shops are modern and clean with a few well known brands. To cross over to the Turkish side was very simple and easy but obviously you must bring your passport with you, you pass firstly through the Cyprus border point then across the ""green line"" buffer zone then on to the Turkish border control, this take take a while in busy periods. Once cleared you immediately notice a different town it's like stepping back in time with small narrow streets and buildings that have been untouched, we personally enjoyed the Turkish side and felt very safe at all times, there is plenty of opportunities to purchase all the well known fashion brands at very cheap prices, one warning you are not allowed to purchase tobacco here and take it back into the Cyprus side. Overall a very interesting and enjoyable experience",Ledras
30,"The monument may say nothing to those who do not know the history of the place, how an island, a city and families were divided in two and why.",Ledras
50,In the past 3 years Ledra Street has transformed itself into the vibrant and buzzing social heart to Nicosia. Independent bars and restaurants have popped up and some have live music which spill out onto the street. Colourful awning provide shade and enticing shops are plentiful. Fully pedestrianised this place now can compete with Barcelona's Ramblas.,Ledras
40,"A narrow pedestrian lot with a lot of cafes, restaurants and shops. Suitable for walks and resting. Near the green line which had the result of hundreds of turkish cypriots to enter the area",Ledras
40,This was easy to do. Lots of people moving back and forth but no real delays that I experienced. Worth doing if you're in the city.,Ledras
30,"My wife and I visited the crosspoint on 2 occassions and found the crossing easy and quick both times,it's strange going up Ledra Street on the Cypriot side with their modern shops and cafe's and to then cross into the occupied Turkish side and it's like stepping back in time,it really is like being in a time warp,the Turkish side seemed dustier and slightly behind the times but was still an enjoyable few hours",Ledras
40,Interesting to be able to cross to Northern side. Not really an attraction but bring your passport. Apparently you cannot bring game good back so beware. There were bag searches if you had plastic bags,Ledras
40,"The actual crossing isn't much to see, but the process for walking into and out of North Nicosia is very straightforward. Just show your passport to the officials on either side. We crossed on a Wednesday in April to meet an old friend for lunch and there was only a few people in the queue, but it could be busier in peak season or at weekends.",Ledras
20,Very quiet when we went through and still took approx 20 minutes. Nothing but tourist tat for sale and be careful if you buy cigarettes as they will sell them to you but you will lose when you return - max 40 per person. We don't smoke so not an issue for us but feel the vendors could be advising people.,Ledras
40,"There is a short delay at the crossing into the Turkish side for passport checks which seem to take longer at the Greek side. The immediate area around the crossing is shops and cafes to catch tourist trade. A visit to the mosque is a bit of a disappointment, not a lot to see when you get in and we didn't feel very welcome. There was a Whirling Derverish display near by which was worth a visit. Ledra street itself has been modernised and made a pedestrian only area. Modernisation is good I suppose but you loose some of the charm that attracted you in the first place. If you haven't been before it is definitely worth a visit.",Ledras
20,I think it is rather sad to see a small european capital like Nicosia divided in two by just a street. There is nothing interesting. Only a few shops for tourists.,Ledras
40,"We were visiting North Nicosia, and whilst strolling around, came across the border crossing point. (Nicosia remains the only divided city in Europe). The crossing was painless enough, with a poignant area of 'no man's land' between the two countries. Our experience of the more sophisticated Greek side was like stepping centuries forward from the Turkish side. It certainly felt more provocative, with Sue feeling the need to clutch her handbag more tightly there. We were glad to get back to the more laid back Turkish side. Turkish Nicosia is splendid - and cheaper! I bought a Besiktas football shirt, and suddenly, I was everyone's friend!!!!!!! We had a meal in a delightful restaurant on a street covered by multi-coloured umbrellas, to shade us from the sun. I have to say that North Nicosia got my vote over it's Southern counterpart.",Ledras
10,"Almost every time ive crossed with my Turkish citizen card i have had an issue and many times been told im not allowed in today, and after showing my British passport im allowed straight in without a problem, this has happend on more than one occasion",Ledras
30,A very busy street with a sad reminder of the turkish occupation. Things seemed to improve on the Turkish side since 2012. Passport control improved considerably. There are various restaurants offering good cypriot food at quite an affordable price.,Ledras
40,"The street which is charming runs for about 1 km and has a border almost half way down. The N Cyprus end then opens into a very nice neighbourhood, well worth the walk.",Ledras
40,It's the crossing point between North & South Nicosia. It's a must to compare and contrast both sides of this divided city. Don't forget your passport.,Ledras
40,"From the hustle and lights of the Greek side have your ID checked by bored looking border control who seem to pity you, you step Immediately into silence. Shuttered and barred, abandoned buildings in the dark buffer zone are just waiting to be eaten by time. The trimly uniformed Turkish guards scowl and look officious while checking your ID as you pass into the darkened, closed, tourist trap by the border. Late at night in April it is deserted. Distant sounds seem to come from bars lit by strip lights. It is a bit of an eerie experience.",Ledras
40,"Show your passport and cross over and the same when you come back,No problem-Things are much cheaper on the Turkish side (and they will take Lire, Euros and some will take Sterling) With plenty of moneyExchange booths if requiredwith more designer type shops on the Greek south.Some of the side streets are blocked off - theses are no go zones for the public.We have actually travelled over many times and as I have said no problems.Remember that no vehicles cross at this crossing !",Ledras
50,This is so slick now but can be a bit busy from mid-morning until mid-afternoon. Show your passport or identity card on one side walk the short distance to the other side and repeat. Just watch if you are crossing north to south that you don't bring across any fake goods as Republic of Cyprus customs will ask to look in all your bags.,Ledras
30,"The place in itself presents no interest, other to cross between two de-facto countries.The guide book advises not to take pictures.There are lots of restaurants shops and important tourist landmarks close to the crossing, on both sides.",Ledras
30,I am puzzled of why crossing from North to South is an attraction...is merely a reminder that Nicosia is the last city in the world that is divided and you need a passport!Saying this the two sides of the same street tell a different story and us just interesting to see it!,Ledras
20,Worth it to get to the other side but not an attraction in its own right - although the sculpture is interesting while you queue.,Ledras
50,"Is a must when you go in Nicosia, I suggest you to pass the border and to see all the houses remained stopped in 74'. Was a really deep experience.",Ledras
50,"Queued up, checked my passport walked through and vice versa. It's not exactly a tourist attraction, it's a means to an end. Wouldn't like to have to queue too long in August though!",Ledras
40,"Staying in Nicosia on Saturday I took my passport and wandered down the busy Ledra Street. My aim to cross over to the North of Cyprus and have lunch at one of my favourite snack bars. The crossing point was busy with a little queuing by some. Not everyone has been on the queuing course. Passport handed over details entered into the computer system and you are away. The snack bar is less than 5 minutes stroll straight down Ledra street. A large Effes and a mixed Pide did the trick. Euros, sterling or Turkish lira accepted. Returning through the crossing point the procedure is repeated at the Turkish Cypriot police check point and your passport is just shown to the Republic of Cyprus police check point. All bags were searched X at the RoC police checkpoint.",Ledras
30,"Don't understand why this is a ""thing"" on tripadvisor. It is not a visitor attraction. It is a means to an end.You queue up and show your passports (it takes about thirty seconds for each passport to be read electronically, so can take some time if there's a queue) to the Turks, regardless of whether you're coming or going.The Greeks are barely interested and just wave you through. In fact, I realised after the second time I went north that you can just walk past the Greek shed - the queue for the kiosk is just for people who want ask silly questions.",Ledras
30,"Is a history point of the divided capital of Cyprus. Until you get there you pass on foot one of the oldest shopping streets of Nicosia with a lot of shops, café and restaurants",Ledras
50,The people either side are very helpful and it's easy to cross. I also enjoy the walkalong Ledra Street looking in the shops as you make your way to the crossing.,Ledras
30,"The crossing is very simple and people are very helpful. However I see no reason as why this place is hyped, perhaps because of my historical ignorance. If you want to shop around or have a nice dinner, The place is good",Ledras
10,"It gives, with all the other crossing points, a lot of pain on Cypriots because it reminds to all of them the Turkey's invasion and occupation, but mostly because we don't have anything but Cyprus's political problem to explain to tourists when they ask why they need to pass by showing their identity card just to learn the Cyprus.",Ledras
50,No problems crossing in either direction.Well worth a visit to the north of the city but it is so hot.,Ledras
40,I have never had any problems going through. I go over once every 2 months. The people either side are very helpful.,Ledras
20,Visited Nicosia with the sole intention of crossing the UN border. Wish we hadn't wasted our time queuing! We spent 10 mins on the Turkish Occupied side before returning back to the Cypriot side. Not impressed.,Ledras
30,Its the border of Turkey and cyprus. You can get into other country by showing your passport at the counter. Very peaceful.,Ledras
40,We thoroughly enjoyed our wander through the border between Cyprus and the North. Nicosia is the last divided capital in Europe and the experience is unique.,Ledras
40,"Nicosia is the last divided city in Europe. Ledra street is a charming pedestrian cobblestone road, that crosses the border between southern and northern Nicosia. The part of the street at the occupied territory was dirty, with shops mostly selling knockoff goods but it seemed more traditional as it was unspoilt from recent human activity. On the other part of the street, which was modern and European, there were plenty shops, for example Debenhams, lots of cafés and restaurants.",Ledras
50,"It is really interesting to see the difference between Greek Cyprus and Turkish Cyprus. The passport control was nice and easy and there were no queues. There's no need to get any Turkish Lira as all the shops and restaurants also take Euro. It's a shame there's nothing to tell you about the history, you'll need to look that up yourself prior to visiting.On the Turkish side there's all the usual tourist tat and on the Greek side are all the usual chain stores.Another review on here said they confiscate your purchases when you recross into the South, that's not true. It was definitely worth an afternoon to go and see, and I would recommend.",Ledras
50,"Nice shopping street, it has bershka, fox, tiger (like enter in Israel). At the end you can cross to the occupied territory, there you have nothing to find.",Ledras
40,"Very easy to cross with a british passport, even entered Cyprus (in girne) via ferry from Turkey and then made my way to the south no problem, crossed the border again no problem. UK government website warns that technically they fine if arrive in the north initially but this is not actually in practice.",Ledras
40,A strange feeling. I wanted to say I had been but there was really nothing else to be gained by crossing over unless you want to visit the cheap bazaar.,Ledras
30,We left our Turkish registered hire car parked in the northern part of the city and walked into the Greek Cypriot area of Nicosia via the UN controlled No Man's Land. The change of currency was the most notable effect of the crossing. Hopefully a peace deal will one day put an end to the current divisions and restore the island's peace and unity - with no need in future to show passports twice in Ledra Street.,Ledras
40,"A busy Sunday afternoon but no queue to speak of. Staff friendly and business-like. No problems at all. Worth crossing over for a look around, but if going Sunday lunch as we did you'll do well to find somewhere to eat that's open.",Ledras
40,We thought we would wonder across. It was easy. Showed our passports at each end and crossed no mans land! Interesting to see how things were left all those years ago.The Turkish Cypriot side is nicer than the Greek Cypriot side. It seems to have been restored better. There is a nice bazar and plenty of fake hand bag shops with caring degrees of quality fake bags and other designer goods. Interestingly there is a sign on the Greek side saying that the transportation of counterfeit good is prohibited!!!!!Worth a visit,Ledras
30,bit of a farce if you ask me.don't buy anything on the north side and then cross over the border to the south because when you cross back over again the south will confiscate it,Ledras
50,You can park your car in a big car park for around 6-7 euros all day next to the bus station and walk to the crossing which is around 5 mins walk easy to find. The crossing takes around 2 mins just scan of passport the the Crossing point is open 24/7,Ledras
50,"It is nice to walk across and see the other side of Nicosia! Take a Taxi from the 'Taxi point' and visit Kyrenia harbour, sit and relax watching the lovely view, and listening to the sea and the waves breaking!!!Get a taxi back to where you were picked up from. You can pay for the taxi with 'Euro notes' as they don't like coins!!!",Ledras
50,Once you are in Ledras str then you are in the old town of Nicosia the capital of Cyprus. Walking to the end of this streat you will come face to face with the Cyprus Natioanl problem of the Turkish occupation because one will end up facing an army blog and will realise that on the other side of this road a thrid is hunging over citizens heads day by day. Don't miss it!!!,Ledras
30,It is a shame that in this day and age there is still such a thing as a divided city. The checkpoint is easy to negotiate if rather a waste of time. I feel sorry for the locals who have to do this all the time. I didn't have to fill in a 'visa' which I'd read about.,Ledras
10,"You imagine an historical check point and symbolic location connecting the Turkish and Greek parts. In reality, a boring and unattractive check point for passport control. Nothing to visit.",Ledras
40,"They said, its the last european divided capital after Berlin. Its two different world, so you should go there. Abandoned houses on the border frighten people.",Ledras
50,It was very easy to cross. Just show your ID or passport and it's then registered for your return. Once across you can visit all the shops and eateries. Although sales are marked in lira the euro is also exchanged. Many places for coffee and sneaks.,Ledras
50,"A somewhat straightforward ""border"" crossing into a not so straightforward situation. Nicosia/Lefkosia is the last divided city in Europe, crossing this border from the south takes you into occupied territory of northern Cyprus. It's very complicated but taking the time to ponder it all as you go from one place to another is very profound.",Ledras
40,"Definitely recommended, it is incredible how a city is divided into two different states! You literally go from Greece to Turkey in a couple of minutes, it's a real culture shock!",Ledras
50,In the old town in Nicosia . A renovated let's say street which is separated due to the Turkish invasion in the island . Now it's open and there is a check point for pedestrians that want to visit both sides of the street.,Ledras
50,Is easy and fast the pass almost all the year long. Is a fantastic experience. Two cultures at meters distance. Nice!,Ledras
50,"Very good for walking, shopping and having fun. Ice cream, lots of brands and soveneer shops. Prices on sale are marvellous and affordable, jumpers, kids and adults.Enjoy.",Ledras
40,"We often hear about this or see it in the news or documentaries, but when you actually see this ""great divide"" you realise its significance - indeed Nicosia is a divided city and Cyprus a divide island BUT despite this, it is a charming and welcoming place and has a cosmopolitan atmosphere.",Ledras
30,"Interesting experience crossing the sides both of cyprus. Was very quick and easy, didn't spend long on the other side though..",Ledras
50,You can cross over at the Ledra st. Crossing and experience the bizarre border between the two divided areas. Miles of abandoned home and buildings in a UN Limbo.,Ledras
40,"We visited the Turkish side of Nicosia two years ago, when last in Cyprus. At that time we were with Turkish colleagues and did a night walk, a very atmospheric experience which really enhanced the narrow streets and old buildings.In the day time things are more commercial and not quite so charming, but it is still an experience to cross the line within the boundaries of what I believe is the last divided city in Europe.Crossing is quick and painless; staff are rather unengaging but for them, of course, it is a job and not an experience.Well worth the trip - go and visit some mosques (in converted Christian buildings) and try to walk out as far as the old walls.",Ledras
50,It's a crossing point between Greek and Turkish parts. Ledra hotel is a official building under the control of the United Nations. Both sides of this point are center of the Nicosia. There are many historical points in Greek and Turkish sides. You must see the Turkish market area and taste some delicious Turkish local meals and coffee.,Ledras
30,Crossing between North and South Cyprus is like moving back and forward in time....in the southern part of Nicosia there are modern shops cafes and bars...all the trappings of modern society. As soon as you cross over to the north it is like stepping back in time....not precisely to a Bizantine age but to an older culture where the cafes are far more traditional and full of Turkish culture. The streets are narrow the buildings acitucturally interesting and the people welcoming.So the Ledra Street crossing is your time machine....from old to new modern culture to ancient culture it is a gateway to a fascinating journey taking you to northern Cyprus. I recommend it to everyone.,Ledras
50,"Borders, scanning your passport as you pass between both sides.Each side is totally different from the other.. different in every way.Highly recommended to go you will sense smell see the difference by yourself",Ledras
50,"In order to get between the North and South parts of Cyprus, you must enter a checkpoint. It is a very simple process where the guards check your passport. Each of the many times I entered, the guards were pleasant, and I encountered no problems traveling between the two sides.",Ledras
50,Very uncomplicated crossing. If you have an European ID it is enough. After the border there is a stand with useful brochures about the Northern part of the island,Ledras
40,"If you come to Nicosia, then a visit across the border is a absolute must, if only to make you realise just how lucky we are to be in a free world.I waited some twenty minutes to cross the border, spent about ten minutes in occupied Nicosia, before returning back.This city is certainly two worlds apart, with the occupied part being ""cold"" and uninviting, certainly as far as my experience was concerned. I also felt intimidated too.There is no laughter, no music, and certainly for me, no reason to ever want to visit the place again.Once back on the other side, all I could hear was people's voices, music and a sense of welcome that is most endearing.As I say, the experience has to be done and my life is now richer from that visit, even if I found no pleasure in it.",Ledras
40,"The Ledra Street border crossing is a unique experience to cross into another country on foot. If you make the short journey from the Greek side to Turkey, make sure you visit the Hoi Polloi bar, on a side street to the right. They play cool bluesy music and serve good beer/wine with olives and feta nibbles. Great value for money too.",Ledras
40,"As the title implies, Nicosia is the last divided capital city in the world. Before the Turkish invasion of 1974, Nicosia was a buzzing and prosperous town where the two communities, Cypriot and Turkish, lived in peace on the island. After the attack though, hatred and pain inundated the hearts of the people. Once friendly neighbors, now enemies in their own country. Both communities feel a nostalgia of the old days when everything was peaceful and they lust for a time to come when a solution comes in place, when everyone can return to their homes and start living like hospitable friends again...",Ledras
50,"Ledra Street is a pedestrian only crossing. Very quick and easy to walk across the border here. Show passport, nothing to pay.",Ledras
50,"This crossing at present time connects two different countries. The place is so low key that a tourist could be surprised by the historical importance of this place. The UN zone is only half block long. A gift shop is located just beside the security checkpoint on the Greek side. Crossing into the Turkish side, one would immediately walk into a new culture, religion and way of life. This place is very safe due to its importance.",Ledras
50,"Nicosia/Lefkosia - a city that elicits mixed feelings from its inhabitants and people who visit. Divided by animosity and border crossings it is a city where, once you pass through the checkpoint, you feel you are in another country. Whist I am saddened by the history and sympathetic to the frustration of needing to cross border checkpoints in your own country, I was also excited by the interesting difference in cultures as you move 100 metres either side. Cypriots walk through freely by showing their ID card, tourists must take their passport. Both sides have a vibrant atmosphere with cafes and restaurants to keep you well fed and hydrated. The north side has jewellery and bags and resembles a bazaar whilst the south side has many well known franchises from around the world. I felt welcome on both sides of the crossing and so did my Cypriot friend. Hopefully one day soon the border crossing, sandbags and wires will be taken from the access points and the division will be no longer.",Ledras
40,Go early to avoid the line Don't forget your passport We had a stroll around bought some things as good value on both sides If your in the old city this is must to go into Turkey,Ledras
50,"A very strange experience: one town, one street, two sides. Crossing from the Greek to the Turkish part is like stepping into another time and place. Everything is different: the architecture, the shops, the caffes, the inviting smell of different food, even the people.For me, it was at the same time disturbing and fascinating.",Ledras
10,Its sad to see this crossing point which divides the island. Unfortunately you need to cross this point with a passport or an ID in order to be able to cross to either side. It gets boring after a while if youre actually living on the island and having to cross it everyday . ..Especially on public and religious holidays its packed.. So lets just hope they stop this nonsense and make peace someday so we can all be free in our own country...,Ledras
50,"We went through passport control and the young man that checked mine said I should go back in the summer when the weather is warmer, how right he was, it was a miserable day.",Ledras
50,"I have ""missed"" the berlin wall so this is an interesting alternative. Fun experience. Must do when in nicosia",Ledras
40,"Walking from the South to the North is like I take one more step and am North or more more step and am back South. It is hard to decide what rating to give. A definite plus goes for the fact that the buildings in the no-one zone were renovated (just where you walk) and look nice, as the architecture is a beautiful one. Ledra Street gives a nice atmosphere with all the shops, cafes and restaurants all the way to the crossing point and were there no passport checks on both sides, one would not feel to entering a different country. The crossing point at some times can require time to wait in line for the passport check, especially when tourist groups cross, so depending on the day and time you may need patience.What feeling and experience you take with you when visiting both sides of one capital is entirely up to you.Enjoy your stay.",Ledras
50,"Is a Street that is very Important to see, is the point that my Country , my Capital City is Half, the other part is in the Turkish part, they took after the War in 1974! Hope soon we have a Solution",Ledras
40,This is the crossing point into and from the Turkish-occupied part of the Island (Cyprus) .It has been open for a few years now allowing the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots and all tourists to have access to the Republic of Cyprus (Ligitimate member of the European Union and the United Nations) and the temporarily occupied by Turkey part .... It is an experience !!!!,Ledras
40,"In the old part of the city. Next to the borders that divide Nicosia in two parts. Several good choices for food, coffee and bears in walking distance.",Ledras
40,Opening Ledra street crossing was a positive step toward the inter-cypriot dialogue. May this allow a complete touristic experience of Cyprus.,Ledras
10,"I would say Nicosia is a very boring city, unless you are fancy in international relations or history of cyprus.Ledra street is claimed to be the busiest area in nicosia but actually there is nothing.",Ledras
50,"Nicosia is a divided city. Ledra's checkpoint opened some years ago. Please hold your passport, in case you want to visit the other side.",Ledras
40,"Very interesting place to be, culture is very nice, people very polite and alot of restaurants and cafes perfecT for a break :)",Ledras
50,"Very easy to cross, that will say if you HAD brougth your passport. But next time we won't foreget to bring it. We turned back to Ledra Street and enjouyed a nice lunch in the Greek side of the city.",Ledras
40,"Very nice, walking area (pedestrian zone) with lots of local and international restaurants and shops, at the end of it is the Borders with north cyprus worth looking at",Ledras
40,"Crossing from the ""free zone"" as it's called the Greek side, to the Turkish side it's a good experience. As such it's enjoyable and there's no hazards or any bad things related to that. The conflict, guess, it's there but nothing bad visible.Going across the Turkish side it's just like in a few steps from the Greek side, going into the streets of Istanbul and stroll in their streets enjoying the food, the goodies and the people.The downtown of Nicosia, or Lefkosia, it's full of historical buildings and as you approach certain areas you can help but notice the UN signs and flags, the concrete emplacements, barbed wire, fencing, bullet holes, and on one side the Turkish flag, and on the oposite the Cyprus and Greek flags.",Ledras
40,"We asked on the Cypriot side if we could cross using Malta ID cards, to which we were told we could.When we walked through and approached the Turkish border control, my ID card (new style with smart chip) was accepted but my colleagues card (old style without smart chip) was not accepted, so we had to return.",Ledras
10,"Normal street and the place dose not worth visiting, especially the crossing point to the part of Cyprus invaded by Turkey. Really disappointed for going there.",Ledras
50,"It's a breathtaking historical place, that gives the chills! A point without return till sole years ago, a point between two worlds, a point of remembering the vivtims of ghe Turkish invasion and the Turkish occupation of a big part of Cyprus. A point that although now someone can cross, is a point that shows that Nicosia is the only split capital in the world!",Ledras
30,Easy to pass from a point to another even though sometimes I found one customs guy a bit condescending.Maybe he found me suspicious or arrogant when I asked why am I stopped while other people can pass thru without checking out ? .His answer : search my backpack.,Ledras
30,"During the day the shops on the turkish site are open, but in the evening everything is dark and empty. The other site is better by night!",Ledras
50,"I love both Greece and Turkey and this is the only place in the world where you can experience both cultures in a short walk. That is what makes Cyprus such a unique place. I prefer the south for their American style hotels and Greek restaurants, and the north for their nightlife. Starting from the south, you pretty much just walk through the checkpoint. No one has ever questioned me. After a short ""no man's land"", you arrive at a collection of trailers which house Turkish Cypriot customs. You used to have to fill out a visa form, but no longer. Just hand your passport to the officer and they do it in their computer. They will not stamp your passport, as no country other than Turkey recognizes the north as a real country. After you walk through a little shopping area, there is a street with taxis, which will take euros, Dollars, or Turkish lira. If you walk a little further and bear right, you can see the bright lights of the Saray Casino. If you want, you can take a taxi to Kyrenia (as the Greeks call it), or Girne ( as the Turks call it) on the north coast, which is an exciting nightlife area. There is also a museum there with an over thousand year old ship which is quite impressive. Taxi fare will be 25-30 euros. When you cross back to the south, you must stop at the Turkish trailer with your passport and they just verify that you checked in when you entered. On the other side, I always offer my passport to the Greek Cypriot officers, but they have never taken more than a quick glance and never asked me a question. One other note: if you take a taxi back to the crossing, be sure they bring you to the Ledra STREET crossing, because there is also a Ledra PALACE crossing, which, if you wind up there as I did one night, you can still cross, but it will be a considerable walk to get back to the Ledra Street area.",Ledras
50,"Great experience to cross from north to south and back again. Passport control, contrary to what some have written on here, was fast and efficient. Great shopping north and south and a great experience, highly recommended.",Ledras
40,"First of it's easy but a passport not ID card must be shown, second thing their is a huge contrast passing from the affluent Greek Ledra street to the souk type winding bazaar on the Turk side. Many places in disrepair but their old buildings are worth it.So yes if you are in Nicosea this is a must do, not the crossing per se but to contrast the two. Usually Ledra street which is a lovely pedestrian walk with lots of cafes is visited by tourists so really you need to extend this by walking over. True it's not like Berlin was just bored border gards but you go for the contrast.",Ledras
30,"Ledra Street Crossing Point is supposedly the heart of Nicosia. Most of the cafes are here. Several shops too. But I didn't find it too interesting. Also, I tried coffee in two different cafes. One was OK but way too expensive and the other one was cheaper (not cheap) but terrible. The gyros I tried in one of the food shops was OK but nothing special.If you walk all the way to the end of the street, you get to the checkpoint from where you can cross to the turkish section.",Ledras
40,Crossing the wall to the occupied part of Cyprus feels like experiencing a small part of the very history of the island.,Ledras
40,"This was my first visit to Nicosia as a divided city . I had previously visited in 1969.The crossing at the Ledra Street checkpoint was easy . We presented our passports and allowed through and then again presented passports on return to the Greek Cypriot side .It was sad to see the derelict houses , barbed wire and strictly no photography signs in the buffer zone .Wandering through the streets on the Turkish side with the little shops and market stalls selling cheap goods . The Turkish Hamam was an interesting building unfortunately the Hannam had been booked for a private function so a Turkish steam bath was not possible .We wandered outside the city walls and went to a Turkish coffee shop and enjoyed delicious baklava and coffee served with glass of chilled water and rose syrup on the side . Directly across the road the Hangover Bar with very large bright lights .Then back to the Greek side no issue with the return a brief look at our passport .Wander down the many side streets off Ledra Street to find lively modern cafes and restaurants .",Ledras
50,"Ledra Street crossing has been open to pedestrians since April 2008 giving access to Lefkosa. We went across at 10am, no queues, no fuss, passport in hand, we checked out no bother. Walked the 20 meters and checked in, no stamp, no bother, no worries, (no return for us as we are leaving the island via Ercan). From what we have been told very much different from the manned barriers, boarded-up buildings, barbed wire and no-photography signs that used to be on this location however just down the road at Ermou St we could see all of the above. It's actually quite chilling as all through the town there are dead ends. Anywhere a road went north has been blocked off, sometimes with guard posts and opposing flags flying. For us it was a must do to making to the crossing as we now have more appreciation of what it stands for.",Ledras
50,"Passed through the crossing on 11th October 2015, having wanted to visit Nicosia for a long time. I parked in the Nicosia municipal car park a minutes walk from the Checkpoint €2 for 24 hours. I was the only person at the time crossing into the Occupied zone it was a hot afternoon but it was strangely quiet and calm while I had my passport checked at the Greek cypriot end . It only takes a couple of minutes to get to the Turkish checkpoint , as I was in the UN buffer zone the local imam was starting the call to prayer which added to the unreal vibe I felt. It is only a rather pot holed road that is no longer than a half of a kilometre but looking at a couple of dilapidated buildings untouched since the Turkish invasion in 1974 you can really sense the history, there's more atmosphere in the area when you enter Turkish nicosia than the bland high streets with all the same chain stores and coffee shops that have sprouted up all over the western world. Once I walked out of the checkpoint I found a old walled fort which is full of shops selling goods which may or not be genius! ! But it is cheap and if you smoke you can get a carton of Cigarettes for 220 Turkish lira , £23GBP Or €32 euro. I recommend a stroll over the Green line to see & a little bit of the world's last divided capital city.",Ledras
50,"I was so surprised and disappointed fount out that there is a town in European Union divided by the force. This is Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. From there I realised how terrible is to have your home in the other side of a fence and you have not the permission to visit it",Ledras
20,"Really the whole place is flooded with Made in China knock-offs of Armani Underwear, really poor copy of Chanel bags and Polo Ralph Lauren shirts. As for shops and cafes, mostly of the type catering to tourists with Coca Cola umbrellas and chairs. Crossing over is interesting for the experience of getting checked to enter and exit, but for ""local' flair it's really a shape and washed over in a Disney atmosphere.",Ledras
40,"Its odd to see a city that stops at a point where you have to show your ID card to continue. But the busy shops on both sides seem to carry on their business as usual , nothing odd at all! There are lots of restaurants and shops along this pedestrian road and if you walk around and look up you can see the remains of the war with the bullet holes in the buildings. Make sure to walk around even if you don;t cross over and you will see no mans land and peep holes to see the ghost like areas that were abandoned during the war. The area is full of trendy bustling bars and restaurants and has become the centre for the main nightlife in the city.",Ledras
20,"Waste of time, some artificially kept feeling that you are a part of history, but as soon as you get there you know that it was not worth the journey.",Ledras
30,"Not sure if this is a sensational visitor attraction but to experience the culture of Nicosia I think you have to visit both sides.Experience the environment talked about by many that has been created by the partition of a city by two nations.It can take some time to get through the Turkish inbound customs check.. Allow at least 20 minutes.I guess it's a smaller version of the Berlin Wall circumstances.If you don't already know the line drawn to separate the two halves of the island is called the ""Green Line"" basically because a british military official drew the partition line on the original map in Green Pen!",Ledras
50,"A very interesting street in the centre of Nicosia with a lot of shops selling designer cloths and shoes, and plenty cafe's and restaurants.On the other end of the street is the crossing point to the occupied area of Nicosia which is under the Turkish rule. It is very easy to cross to the other side, but you need your ID ,or passport.",Ledras
40,"This is the intersection most of the culture like, Lusignan, ottoman, Venice. There are lots of old houses and shops available. If you walk 100mt to south you can find many cafes and bars.",Ledras
50,Quite relaxed crossing. Before crossing I took a look to the right (Liperti St.) and took a cappuccino in a great sweet bakery Biktoria / Victoria.,Ledras
40,"Walking with my friend, we realized that some security checkpoint was in front of us. It was so easy to get in the Turkish side of Nicosia. There is a remarkable difference between both sections. The Turkish seems more disorganized and people are less friendly compared to the other Greek side. Nice to hear the call for prayer in there.",Ledras
30,"it's like entering one country from another, you need to produce your valid travel permit, your passport and the Turkish authority will stamp it.",Ledras
40,"Once in Nicosia, feeling bore? Visit this street. You will find plenty of restaurants and very lively place. Normally this is something which you will not find elsewhere in Nicosia. Its a must visit place. The border is quite nearby, you can visit Turkish part from this point onward. Just take your passport to immigration point.",Ledras
50,"you must visit that street, no cars pass there, full of shops, souvenirs, restaurants, cafe shops, super market, kiosks, and even ATM machines.it's so beautiful at night, see the attached photos.prices of restaurants are average and high, souvenirs are a bit expensive.",Ledras
50,"My wife is inclined to get a bit bad tempered when standing in a queue to present her passport, and on occasion when asked ""what is the purpose of your stay"" will reply ""mind your own business"" - you can imagine the hassleWe wanted 2 hours on the Turkish side of the street just to amble around and do the ""Inn"", look at the cheap things for sale etc.It's a bit of a pain frankly - presenting your passport to both sides of the fence each time, total 4 times, and standing with some locals that had just jumped our queue.I could see my wife's blood begin to boil.Never the less, we made it back across after 2 hours walk about, and I appeased the boss with some shopping.I am glad we ticked the box, and there is certainly a different feeling as you cross over from the modern Greek into the slightly impoverished feeling of the Turkish side - perhaps that was just us, as the history on the Turkish side of Nicosia is amazing - the beautiful buildings, the incredible history and of course cheap trainers and fake watches if you must!Do it... And if you have a short fuse, make certain to spend some time on each side - don't try to rush it.",Ledras
40,Quick and efficient and friendly staff. We were warned to NOT TAKE PICTURES of crossing on Turkish side.,Ledras
50,"When I first came here as a child 18 years ago all that was here was a guard post and viewpoint with a display showing pictures of Greek Cypriots who had gone missing during the events of 1974. It has changed drastically over the years as now it is a crossing point where people can cross the Green Line and enter the Turkish occupied part of the city. I was actually surprised to discover during my recent visit that the display is still there tucked behind the hut to the side of the crossing, I didn't see it last time I visited it and assumed it had gone. Hopefully the opening of the borders over the last decade will eventually lead to people both Greek and Turkish Cypriot being able to go back to their former homes. My boyfriend is a police officer in the UK and he spoke to both the Turkish and Greek police officers at the border and got his photo taken with them, they were lovely. I definitely recommend coming to see the crossing point, it is a living piece of history though you need to bring your passport if you want to cross over the border.",Ledras
50,"On the way back from Paphos, we again got in Nicosia, the capital and largest city on the island of Cyprus. It is a main business center, which lies in the Mesaoria plain, on the banks of the river Pedieos. In the difference from the cities we've been already in, as Larnaca, Paphos, Limassol, Agia Napa, Famagusta and Kyrenia, Nicosia is located in the interior part of the country ( in the inland) and as the issue of that the temperatures during the summer are higher than in the coastal towns. Also the winters are colder than in the maritime places. Nicosia is the seat of government of the Republic of Cyprus and the farthest southeast of all EU member states capitals.Nicosia is continuously inhabited for over 4500 years and has been the capital of Cyprus since 10th century.So when we arrived in Nicosia, that was the Solomos Square where we got off the bus, the place of the main bus station in Lefkosa. It is one very nice square surrounded by the residential and public buildings and with some green area present as well. We headed downward from the Solomos Square, passing by the big construction site and turned in the Ledra street, the main shopping venue in Nicosia.There are here a lot of branded stores, cafes, restaurants, taverns and we chose one to sit there for awhile. As we were proceeding to the north end of the street, we felt some change in the scene that we encountered along,that is, the other people, the other language ( turkish), some kind of different stores and abruptly bumped to the crossing point, to the northern Turkish Cypriot part of city, which was divided in 1963, following the intercommunal violence that broke out in the town then.We handed out our passports to the officials on the border and pursued further in the turkish Nicosia. The mosques, the muslim markets, the hamams ,the all of this were here at our sight. Just hanged there for quite a time and then returned again to the check point. Afterwards went to our Solomos Square to catch the bus for Larnaca.What to say at the end but that we seized a little bit this impact of the two worlds, the christian and muslim.",Ledras
40,"Leora Street is great for watching the hustle and bustle of a small part of the Capital's population. Sit awhile at one of the numerous Coffee Shops or Eateries and watch businessmen, tourists and the Cypriots go about their day. Plus of course you can visit the Turkish side of the City where you can enjoy yet more shops and eateries. The Crossing Point is now a lot more straightforward and you will need your Passport.",Ledras
40,"If you're in downtown Nicosia, and you want to take a quick stroll to the North side, this is the place to cross.",Ledras

50,"We booked the Nicosis Day at Leisure trip with Atlas Travel,in Coral Bay.It was only 20 Euros each for the trip and it turned out to be money well spent.We was picked up early in morning from hotel and then the worst bit driven round Paphos picking up fellow travellers but it still wasn't bad. Once on the way and everyone on board our rep for the day ( a fellow called Dave a retired Archeologist from America)Kept us thoroughly entertained giving us tips on what do when in Nicosia and telling us the history of the Island as we travelled. He did not stop all the way and was funny and informative and we learnt things about the Island never heard of before.Once in Nicosia we was dropped of in a central location and given 4 and half hours to do what you want.As we had been to Nicosia before we walked down Ledra Street and went through to the Turkish occupied side ( do not forget to take your passport. There you can walk round and see the old mosques converted from churches and shop in the markets and bag a few bargains in the market buying some good Designer wear copies.There's are some good bars and cafes there as well.On walking round the occupied side for a couple of hours we returned to the Greek Cypriot side and strolled through the side streets with it great little bars and restaurantsbefore returning to the coach. Which was there on time to drive us back to the hotel.Dave our rep said he would be quiet and let us sleep and wake us at our hotelsThis was a great day out and well worth the 20euros.",Ledras

40,"It is 20 years since we last visited Nicosia and Ledra Street was firmly barricaded between the Greek and Turkish points then. It is still very sad that there is still a division right across the city, but at least it is now possible to walk the length of Ledra Street. However, you need to have your passport checked before you are able to walk through to the northern side of the city.",Ledras
40,"This is not an attraction but a boarder control to cross over to the north of Cyprus a quick and easy process to get to the other side , I feel a great sadness for the divided city and hope that soon the north and south reunite and make Nicosia whole again.I have read remarks here from people saying they have visited turkey ,you are not in turkey you are in northern Cyprus occupied by the Turkish ,there is a different culture feel from the south only a few feet away ,lets hope that soon checkpoint Charlie as the boarder crossing is known will be gone and the Cypriots and Turkish people will live in harmony in Nicosia.",Ledras
40,Really nothing to note. In the center of downtown walking district in Nicosia that divides the north from the south. Bring your passports if you want to cross over (walking only). The north seemed a little run down or not as nice as the southern part of Nicosia. Food is available from local shops. Really nothing to see at the checkpoint other than it is just a checkpoint.,Ledras
50,"Every time I am at this location a flood of thoughts and feelings rushes threw me, the history and incidents of more than 50 years flashes back in my head, leading me to hope that people have learned something and that the future will be brighter...",Ledras
30,"There is nothing here of note, to be honest (historical importance aside, that is). But this is the most convenient crossing point between the south and the north. It isn't really an attraction, but a fact of life to experience.",Ledras
50,"I have actually only crossed at this gate but I think it's easy to get to, the parking (by McDonald's - underground) is cheap and easy and then just walk a few blocks to cross.",Ledras
50,"No visit to the Capital would be the same without crossing the green line and walking from one country to another, whatever your views may be about whether it should be or not.It is a strange feeling and I think one that a lot do with a little concern at first, will you be allowed back, what if you get lost or stranded and what if you lose your pasport. Nothing happens and your simply have a piece of paper stamped and show your passport and walk along, you can spend as long or as little as you want the other side and as it is a main crssing you see lots of people going about their daily lives. You can immeditaely see a difference in the two sides though which is odd to most of us I think but it is memorable and if you walk on there are some nice sites to see.Worth crossing, provided you have your passport, it is surprising how many you hear asking why they need to show it or those that have not brought it!",Ledras
40,Crossing from North to South Cyprus through the last remaining capital city in the world is an experience but sad that after 40 years there is still no reconciliation,Ledras
30,"Essentially this is just 2 sets of guards checking passports 100 or so yards apart... but this makes for a unique experience, which for some reason seemed a little sombre, or sad, thinking about the story of the divided city. Worth doing just for the experience, especially if you've taken note of the history",Ledras
20,"Leora street is great - full of gift shops bars etc on both sides of the divide, but the actual crossing is just a few guards checking passports.",Ledras
50,We wanted to experience for real how a capital is divided in 2015. This is a very unique and interesting experience; not to be missed!,Ledras
40,"It's sad in 2015 to have a divided European Capital. The pedestrian crosspoint is found at the end of the Free part of the island and there is a Police check point to safeguard the country. It's easy to Cross, need to show your European i.d. at the other side check point.",Ledras
40,"We wanted to see both sides of this divided city and as such we had to cross through the 'border' between the Greek side and the Turkish side of Nicosia and back again. Fairly simple really. We already knew it would be sensible, and probably essential, to have our passports and this it proved the case. We had to show our passports first to get out of the Greek side and then it was a near thirty metres or so before we showed them again to get into the Turkish side. It was the same coming back. No stamps just they wanted to see who you were and it was logged I believe. No real queues when we went through both ways but one chap did try and just walk through and he was dragged back, so they take it very seriously indeed. We went through circa 12.30 pm and came back a couple/three hours later and there were no issues at all. Very interesting though to see the different sides and there really is a difference.",Ledras
50,"This was a good experience, the guards on both side are really friendly. When entering back into Cyprus I showed my US passport and they dint even open it - just waved me by. Easy to travel to. First take the bus to the Karvelli, (buy a 5 Euro bus bass for all day travel on the Pafos bus system. Go across the bus parking lot and board the Green bus to Nicosia. It takes 2 hour on the Green bus ride from Pafos for 13 Euros round trip.",Ledras
50,"Well worth a visit if you are in Nicosia.You need a passport of photo ID and you pass from the Southern authority side to the Turkish northern authorities. This is one of the last divided cities in the world and you are granted a 90 day visa once through control at the Northern side.We visited a nice cafe, had some nice food and drink and the shopped at the many jewellers and bustling shops at the side streets all through the bazaar esc style street merchants. Very enjoyable afternoon and well recommended.One word of warning though!! Nicosia is built on a natural bowl and it many degrees warmer than the surrounding areas and to the West areas of Paphos etc so be warned and drink plenty of water.",Ledras
50,"There is only one divided city left in the world, and it is a good experience to cross the boundary, even if it is not that exciting. The actual formalities (for EU citizens) are light, and everyone is friendly, and in the end it is just a checkpoint. But crossing over is something that you and your children won't forget.",Ledras
50,A place full of hustle and bustle. A lot of people walking around and so many shops. The most important thing is that there is a parking space. I really liked my visit there.,Ledras
50,"I would also recommend going to the Northern Cyprus. It was interesting to visit some important places there, in the occupied territory. The checkpoint itself is also worth seeing. Who knows, maybe both parts will reunite soon and you will have a photo near some ""touch the time"" landmark",Ledras
50,"Walking through Ledra Street you experience the hospitality of Cyprus with excelent coffee houses, restaurants and nice shops with good bargains.An suddenly you bump info ""Checkpoint Charlie"" just if time stood still.A wall that's deviding the City For over 40 years. It's a incredible that we still have this situation in Europe..Please see It with your own eyes.You can cross if you want.",Ledras
40,"Not sure if this is an attraction, just a crossing point. It does not take a long time to cross, but it may if there is suddenly an organized tour in front of you. There are free tourist brochures and maps.Nearby attractions: a shopping street on the Greek side and Buyuk Han on the Turkish side.Drinks and food are cheaper on the Turkish side, ask to pay in TL.",Ledras
50,"When you visit here please remember that it is not a tourist attraction but the physical reality of a city that has been permanently divided since 1963.It is sadly one of the few places in the city that you can cross from the south to the occupied north and having taken the opportunity to, it is something that our family will never forget.It is actually surprisingly easy to do though you will obviously need your passport or ID card to do so. You walk through control on the south side and though we queued for a short while we were told this was unusual. There is then a walk of about 50m through the UN controlled buffer zone and no man's land to the northern control. The DMZ is fascinating in part for the shortness of the distance, but also for the flash back into history that it offers you. No photography signs abound in this area.A short queue enables you to pass into the North. Passports are scanned, but not stamped and you are granted a 90 day visa for access though most do as we did and walk around the northern area for an hour or so before returning.The North is a sharp contrast to the modern South. A bazaar replaces the modern shops/restaurants and cafes a few hundred metres away. There is no need to obtain Turkish Lira as all the places that we visited accepted Euros.",Ledras
50,"Even if much softer, this place brought my thoughts back to Berlin pre-1989 - whilst not exactly nice, I suppose one cannot forget history.",Ledras
40,"Honestly, it seems more interesting now when I talk about the border crossing on the street than it was at the moment. You don't need anything else than a passport to go to the other side. They didn't put any stamp in our passport, just gave us a small paper on the Turkish border and reviewed it on crossing back. The Greek park of the street is modern with a lot of restaurants, bars and shops. Turkish side is totally different and you will notice that after just a few steps. Visit Selimiye mosque (free entrance), drink traditional Turkish coffee and buy some souvenirs.",Ledras
50,"Fascinating place. Never knew there was still a ""DMZ"" on the edge of the EU! Well worth a trip to Nicosia and a walk across the border if you're in Cyprus.",Ledras
30,Take you passport and cross over by foot to the northern occupied side of Nicosia. You probably wont need much Turkish money as you might want to cross back over within a few minutes. Very uninviting and dirty streets.,Ledras
40,"Since this cross point was opened, walking across has become easier. Now you only need to flash your passport or ID card (unless you are a refugee/immigrant/'illegal' worker). How easy is that? But stepping across The Line we forget the years of war and suffering that both communities have gone through and still going through. Across the barbed wire, sandbags and derelict buildings the feeling is of recognition and reconciliation. A couple of hundred meters takes you from trendy Ledra street with its tradition outdoor cafes and retro-industrial restaurants to an open air market and the beautiful Buyuk Hamam. Definitely worthwhile-but don't go blind, read the history first and try to predict the future.",Ledras
50,"Ledra street is a great experience and gives guests a feeling of Cyprus history. Across the street and nearby region you can also enjoy a walk and eat at some good restaurants, have excellent ice cream, drink traditional Cyprus coffee.",Ledras
30,"If you need to cross it then do that for sure, otherwise nothing too special about that place. There is a nice bazar on the Turkish side several minutes walk from there which is much more attractive",Ledras
50,"East-west: Check point Charlie, check points between ukraine and occupied territories, sandbags and soldiers - here north - south - why?",Ledras
30,"The checkpoint part of the so called 'Green' line that separates the rest of Cyprus from the globally unrecognised Turkish-occupied north. Now free to roam on both sides, this was not the case a few years back. What's interesting to see is the still derelict 100m or so buffer zone that separates the two sides.",Ledras
50,It is fascinating to see the crossing one side is Turkish the other side is greek. Two separate world next to each other; great things to see on both sides,Ledras
30,"After Berlin, the only divided city in Europe. It was very strange to walk across from one check point through to the next with UN presence in the middle. An experience worth encountering.",Ledras
50,worthwhile trip to see the turkish quarter .Lot of souvenir shops and copies of designer bags etc .Pricey must say especially the leather ones. Great for silver and gold jewellery . Ps just rememberto barter .,Ledras
50,"Picture the scene: you have shown your passport to the Cypriot authorities, but you have not yet entered Turkey. You walk along a 50 yard street where there are ""no photograph"" signs all around, then your passport is scanned as you enter Turkey. Modern history at work in front of your eyes.We only stayed in Turkey for ten minutes! A brilliant little experience, and a must for anyone in Nicosia for a couple of hours.",Ledras
50,"We (family of 4) visited Nicosia in the middle of Aug when it is very quiet due to the local holidays and blistering heat (40 degrees). The only plus sign of this is that there are no queues whatsoever when crossing the the UN controlled zone.I'd heard much about the crossing and how for many years it had not been possible, then gradually through UN and EU help it has finally become possible to cross. The process is straightforward (if you are an EU passport holder) and you do not require any visas or any stamping of passports. You will find though that the Greek and Turkish sides seem to scan your passports of entry and exit, and whilst it was fine for us as it was quiet, it must be this process would cause queues at busy times.The difference between North and South is noticeable and feels a bit like leaving Europe altogether, even though its the same city and 41 years ago had no separation. The Ottoman influence is obviously more venerated in the North and the the historical architecture is fascinating where you have old French style Gothic churches that have been changed to Mosques by installing minarets, over 300 years ago.I found the people of the North to be similar to the South, in that I found the shop keepers in the South to be pushy and the North was similar although a bit less so as the people seemed more reserved. On a practical note the North is much cheaper and you Euros was accepted everywhere so don't trouble yourself changing Turkish Liras unless you're going further afield or staying longer. Standard exchange rate was 3 TL= 1Euro which was standard in all shops and very close to actual exchange. Most goods had prices on them and were cheaper than the south, but don't expect anything vastly different.The children (9 and 12) were most fascinated by the UN buffer zone, which is a mere 20 metres in most of Nicosia, but engulfs the old airport outside of the city. You can still see the bullet holes and the abandoned empty buildings in the buffer zone give the crossing an eerie feel but very compelling. The kids just thought it was incredible that such a situation can exist in the middle of a city and last over 40 years.Mostly what surprised me about the entire old town both North and South was how beautiful the Architecture was, and how much it has been influenced by the Franks and then the Venetians and is unlike anywhere else I have visited in Cyprus. However you need to look up when you're wondering around the narrow streets to see it. Note that both North and South have many small decrepit streets (North more so), and in both you can feel suddenly far from the maddening crowd by just walking a few paces fro Ledra street.I'd like to go back when it's not so hot!",Ledras
30,"Cannot understand why it is listed here??? It is a normal crossing point, just like everywhere else. No unusual thing will happen.Bring just a lot of water, as it is burning outside, and from time to time lines can be huge.",Ledras
40,Went as a family and parked next to m&s on the south side just outside the wall. Loads of fascinating little streets and shops on both sides but it's a shame the city is divided as it could be extremely beautiful.... Well worth a visit,Ledras
50,"Nice to see what a street looks like when it's stuck in time, you can really see the difference of the north vs. the south sides",Ledras
50,"We read the reviews and thought we would give it a try - well worth the experience.It was so easy to cross - no form filling and no stamps in the passport .Once in North Cyprus, we did some shopping(incredibly cheap) and then negotiated with a local taxi to have him and his Mercedes car for 5 hours to visit St Hilarion Castle and the port at Kyrenia, Amazing day and he was incredibly helpful at a very reasonable cost.North Cyprus is so different but certainly not under-developed - well worth a visit and exceptional value for money.",Ledras
50,I felt compelled to cross the border having come all the way to Nicosia. I had some concerns going through with children based on other reviews but we had a good experience today. It wasn't busy and the queues were really short. Our passports were thoroughly checked but there were no bag searches or problems. The no- mans land is very sad but the children were fascinated and asked lots of questions later. They were actually subdued into silence while crossing-a first for them.We were all really fascinated by what we saw in Northern Nicosia and would have liked to spend more time there. Not a tourist attraction but an experience which puts many other things we take for granted into perspective.,Ledras
30,"Crossed over from South to North today and must admit found it a rather sad experience. Passports checked and scanned but no longer ""stamp on bit of paper"" crossing the Turkish side which I was expecting and surprised me. Greek control reminded me I was crossing a checkpoint and not a border. Once in the Turkish side few market stalls bars shops etc. But no Debenhams or KFC. Reminded me of crossing checkpoint Charlie in Berlin. Hopefully one day soon this wall will also come down. Not wishing to get involved in politics all I would say to finalise is interesting from a cultural point of view.",Ledras
40,This is worth doing for the experience of crossing a neutral UN controlled zone from one country to what is claimed by Turkey as another. It is rather sad to see the derelict buildings but the guards are not threatening and seemed resigned to this peculiar arrangement.,Ledras
40,"They have many shops down this street, lots of places to buy souvenirs. It is better to go with a local to make certain you get the right prices. Be sure to not take photos in certain areas here. Watch the signs.",Ledras
30,"It is very easy to cross the border. You have to go to customs twice, but you're in the other part in just 2 minutes.",Ledras
40,Not a tourist attraction; it is political issue of an existing conflict between christians and muslimsEurope should be shame about the existing situation; another European failure.,Ledras
40,It's a very odd feeling to cross a UN administered neutral zone in the middle of a country's capital city into another country that isn't officially recognised by your own government.The crossing point itself was fine to get through on the day we were there with a very short queue on the Greek side and a slightly longer one on the Turkish side but I can see how it could be busy later in the season. You can't really see much as you walk through the neutral zone as everything is blocked off but if you look up you can see how the buildings have been abandoned and are sort of time capsules of that day in 1974.It's definitely worth visiting the Turkish side. You can sense an immediate difference - it is a lot quieter and the pace of life is obviously slower. I found the people to be just as friendly as on the Greek side and no more or less pushy about selling things. It is obviously poorer than the Greek side but it is all the more authentic for that. It hasn't been turned into a modern western city like every other yet.,Ledras
50,"you can visit north cyprus by crossing border with pasport you can go Büyükhan (great inn) and bandabuliya (old market) Selimiye cami,",Ledras
40,"this crossing point is a border where you can cross to occupied Cyprus in the north, there is a very nice gallery with roof garden events nearby called 1010hall which is cool and can be found in facebook for events, another interesting point is to have local ice cream heraclis and try the rose flavor",Ledras
50,"A must if your in town (Nicosia). Its a bit crowdy at the passport checkes, but the crossover is an unusual experience. The buildings in the neutral zone are all abonded and gives an postapocolyptic feeling. A must and tourist friendly.",Ledras
30,"What does one say? It's a border crossing.It is the easiest point for tourists on one side of the city to visit the other side. The contrast between the (comparatively) affluent south and the economically depressed north is more obvious if you venture beyond the shops on the north side selling tourist tat such as fake handbags. For that reason, it's worth heading north, if only to contrast the attitudes of the generally friendly Greek Cyriots to that of the surly Turks. A few yards really does make a difference!",Ledras
40,"My wife and I, had decided to spend the day out in Nicosia as a break from being in Paphos!So we bought a day explorer city to city national bus pass each, for 15 euro and at 8am headed off to the East by the direct route, along the motorway! just under 2 hours later we disembarked in Nicosia central bus station, (To get to the crossing) when you exit the bus turn towards the back of the bus and follow the road across(at pedestrian crossings) up the slope and down the small hill 4-5 metres only before it levels off, bare to the right at junction and walk a small way until you come to a wider street/road turn left and follow your nose, you will eventually come to the crossing.There is a border passport control (Greek) where the locals from the Turkish side seem to just barge pass you, with NO sorry or pardon, flashing there I.D cards before carrying straight on to the Turkish passport check point about 50 metres away and beyond. Half way across this NO MANS LAND take time to look left and right and spot the old fighting spots and barricades (for better views turn right before the Greek check point and follow the small ally about a 100 metre in it gives you a better prospective.After you get clearance from the Greek officials you walk down into the Turkish check point, and get a different feel automatically, they aren't as polite or friendly.....they are curt and snappy, almost demanding Definitely NOT welcoming AT ALL, an American couple who were in front of me were ordered to buy a visa lasting a month, even though they were spending only the day there, to look around as we were, the said they hadn't the cash on them and were escorted to a Cash machine in a local shop to get the payment for the visa and the return of their passports!We expected the same but got our passports scanned and then got waved on by in to the Turkish quarter, As we walked around the area, and saw how the great church had been turned in to a Mosque, and all the springs around it had Muslim script placed on them.We decided to go in to the local produce market, and felt unsure as to being there! No one said anything to us, or even bothered to say hello, left and walked around the back streets further in, we actually thought the buildings were ruins BUT were actually being lived in, walls were cracked and the wiring on the buildings were a absolute spaghetti junction and mess!We had seen enough and went back to the crossing point, again to be barged past by the Turkish pass holders, and left hanging around in the open 30+ heat whist every facet of the passports of others were checked, by one man! even though there were several on duty and a crowd waiting in a long line (The Turkish seemed to relish you sweating)we found out that there is a viewing point at the DEBENHAMS store a couple of hundred metres up the road on the left if you are walking from the check point, and obviously on the right when walking down from the bus station!To get to the viewing point walk into the store and got to the lifts (on left of shop floor) push the number 6 button, on arrival at 6 exit the lift and turn left around the corner through anther door, and you will see another lift! Enter this lift and press,11th floor button you will exit and turn left into a kiosk area! 2 Euros per person gains entrance in to the 360 degree experience,There are slide shows and a small shop in there too!Toilet facility is in the area of the 6th floor",Ledras
30,NOT a place to visit as such as it is 'just' a border crossing between the south and north parts of Nicosia. However it has always had and will remain to do so a major emotional and historical significance to those whose lives have been affected by the conflict between the Greek Cypriots and Turks. I hope some resolution maybe found which will allow all people freedom of passage but until this happens make sure you take your passport with you.,Ledras
50,"Place for teenagers, shopping, currency exchange..After walking around the old monuments, museums and seeing the history of the city, u can come here to relax and have a drink...",Ledras
40,"Short queue, they immigration check your passport, no stamp then you go straight across the few metres border line, short queue at turkish-cyprus immigration check-point. check your passport and no stamp, smile and there you go! Simple and easy. But it is still depends on your passport (Im holding Malaysian passport so its easy to enter).",Ledras
40,"Lidras street has been regenerated the last 3 or 4 years (as i was informed). Former to that, the place was abandoned. Now it is full of life, bars, tavernas etc. The feeling though at the croos point is quit strange. You have to show your ID, and you understand that the city is divided. Really frustrating feeling. Once you cross the ""border"" you can feel the different atmoshepe by the way people are looking at you.",Ledras
50,"One long shopping street everything for everyone cloths ,jewellery,perphumes ,there is a crossing point from north to South passport required,small narrow streets beware if you stop to long to look you will be pounced on from the seller",Ledras
40,If you have the time make this trip.Try to go early morning before 9.30 and you will save time queueing at passport control. They will give you a separate visa rather than stamping your passport which is much easier if you travel to Greece at some later stage.The difference between the two cultures is very noticeable and it is well worth looking at the old colonial court buildings and the cathedral (now a mosque). There are also great places to eat or just have a Turkish coffee. Some travellers may find it uncomfortable but the locals seem to be very friendly as they go about their business.,Ledras
10,"Hated it, auful , discusting,not europe at all,reminds me of the wall in berlin but now is 2015,dont pass the borders,stay on the legal-official side of the island",Ledras
30,"Crossing the border from one side of Nicosia to the other is a trip in and of itself. It's not so much a sight to see, as a strange and sad experience.The process is not complicated and if you are nervous, do not be. If you are in either half of Nicosia and wonder about the other side, I would recommend crossing the border to experience it fully.It's a weird thing to experience two completely different cities and atmospheres in the space of a short stroll. You walk through a no-man's land with crumbling buildings and ghostly spaces under UN control. If you cross at the Ledra Palace / Paphos Gate crossing, the experience is even more surreal, because it takes a good 8 minutes or so to walk through the Green Zone (i.e., the no-man's land) to / from the Turkish Cypriot side to / from the Greek Cypriot side.",Ledras
50,"Fast service, un-bureaucratic on both sides. Impressive contrast between North and South. Worth crossing only if you have extra time to spend on the other side. Greek side is more developed and their inhabitants speak better English. Also more restaurant and ""touristy things"" are in the south",Ledras
40,"Always helpful and friendly. Easy access, walkable. Great contrast between the two sides. But the North is so friendly and relaxed, great food too.",Ledras
40,"Crossing from the Greek side into the Turkish side is fairly painless, although do not mention to the Greek Cypriots that you are visiting the Turkish side, they insist it is all Greek Cyprus & the Turks are only temporary, even after 41 years of occupation.Quite a contrast too once you cross over, less activity & much fewer shops & restaurants. A lot of North Nicosia is still in ruin after the 1974 invasion, still worth the effort though.",Ledras
40,"Very emotional, very sad. first time crossed the border into North Cyprus when back in the 70'ES we could come and go as we pleased without a borderline in sight. looking at the empty houses and shops which was once home and lively hood for many people now strand empty and in ruin, and it is sad that this has attracted tourist from all over the world to see.Lots of history I Love Cyprus there is lots of exploring to do the people are lovely beautiful mountains ie.go up to Troodos lovely villages on the way up unspoilt village taverners stop and savour the beautiful surroundings,and enjoy every minute whilst in Cyprus.",Ledras
40,"crossing this borderline, and especially the atmosphere of the surroundings - empty ruins of decent houses covered with concertina - is a very special thing. To me I gave me a weird feeling of realising how close war can be.",Ledras
10,"This border divides good and bad. Tasteless and cheap with history and pride. Not so much to say, I feel there should be nothing like this in the year 2015...",Ledras
40,"The Ledra Street crossing has been open for a number of years but it is easier than ever to cross from Southern Cyprus to Northern Cyprus in the centre of the Old Walled Medieval city of Nicosia, more properly Lefkosia. In front of the Greek side is a moving memorial which attests to the years of silence between the two communities. This crossing is now at the centre of a vibrant street scene with Ledra Street, the old ""Assassins Alley"" during the last years of the British occupation in the 1950's, the main shopping artery leading to this crossing.",Ledras
50,"The old combines with the new, so many options for restaurants and bars ...cozy,Cypriotic flavor and authentic. Love at first sight! Enjoyed it so much!",Ledras
40,Whilst in Nicosia Ledra Street Border Crossing is a must to do just for the experience to compare both sides of the border.,Ledras
50,"If you are debating whether to cross the border or not, you should definitely do it. It's amazing how culturally different the two parts of the town are. And the fact that it's essentially the same street, that's so culturally different, makes it even more unique and worth seeing.You need your travel documents in order to cross to the other side at the Ledra Street Checkpoint. There are both Turkish and Greek checkpoints. It's not too crowded, but it may take some 20 minutes on average to cross from one side to the other.Many tourist cross the border here.I personally liked the northern part better, so I spent many hours there.From there you can take a local bus to Kyrenia which is considered to be the most beautiful coastal town in Cyprus. The bus ride takes about 30-40 minutes.",Ledras
40,"The Greek Cypriot part of the street is clean and tiny, full of shops, restaurants and coffee houses. After producing our passports at both Greek and Turkisn checkpoints we walked to the Turkish side, noticing the cultural differences from the very forst minute. It's really weird crossing a divided city, so yes, I would definately recomend it.",Ledras
30,"It's difficult to describe the border between north and south Cyprus where it comes through Nicosia's shopping area in Ledra Street, whilst the crossing is efficiently operated and is bright and tidy, imagine walking down Regent Street in London or 5th Avenue in New York and finding you can't go all the way without changing countries, a little weird, at least one can cross with relative ease now and hopefully this will continue and improve as time passes.",Ledras
30,"You can only cross the border on foot. Although the Northern part is de jure part of the EU, we needed travel documents to cross there and back. There is a nice statue on the Greek side with plaquettes indicating that Nicosia is the only divided capital left in the world.",Ledras
40,"This is my first time visiting the Turkish part. Crossing is convenient, using the same visa, checking first on the Greece part and then 10 meters to check for the Turkish part. one cam see the differences in culture. I like the Turkish part as it looks like micro Istanbul.",Ledras
40,Didn't have any problem crossing over. We used the same visa as we used earlier in the week when we crossed over to go to Famagusta.In a matter of 100 metres you just walk back 40 years in time. Plenty of small shops and cafés but the difference being no one was trying to force you to buy.,Ledras
20,"We hope for a day in the near future where we don't need to cross a border to visit the other side of our own island. Meanwhile, the ledra street crossing point is a very convenient in terms of connecting the side of the Nicosia inner cities. You can only cross the border by foot which is a plus in terms of no traffic which makes it quicker.",Ledras
40,"We visited on a day trip from Paphos - a long journey but worth it for the experience of crossing from Greek Cyprus to Turkish Cyprus.The actual crossing is easy and quick ( on the day we went) you approach along Ledra street and produce your passport at the checkpoint and fill in a form which is stamped - don't lose the form as you will need to hand it in on your return. So no passport stamps.Once over the border there's lots of market stalls, shops selling boxes of Turkish Delight, the Selimiye Mosque and Buyuk Han.Interesting to wander the streets and sample the delicious cheese filled pastries made with paper thin pastry available in the restaurant in the corner of Buyuk Han.",Ledras
30,No idea what was going on here. We knew where we wanted to get to but little signage and little in way of helpful police.That said I relatidly pain free operation as long as you have plenty of time. These guys are not in a rush!,Ledras
50,"I recommend going from Nicosia, Cyprus to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, (the world's only divided capital). It is very straight forward; you stop quickly at the Cyprus checkpoint, where bored guards will waive you though pretty quickly, (they will warn you that you can refuse the stamp in your passport if you want). You then walk about 100-yards through ""no man's land"" which has an eerie feeling to it, (basically a bunch of old buildings that have been uninhabited since the 1970's, but gives you the feeling that you are being watched - and makes you think of snipers) then you arrive on the Turkish side. The guard there will ask you if you want a passport stamp, (and why wouldn't you?). You are then free to walk around the Turkish side. Spoiler Alert: Other than a casino - there is not much over there. When you leave, the process is reversed. The whole process is quite painless and safe, (it is much easier to get around then the the Moldovan - Transnistria zone). There are UN, Cyprus and Turkish soldiers near there, but I never saw them, though a former Cyprus soldier was attempting to point out their locations. If you visit Cyprus, it doesn't make sense to miss this.",Ledras
30,It's a must but organised its not on way out took 15 mins and only 4 folk in front of us on way back through Turkish side about 8 folk in our queue took 30 minutes lol the staff wander off talk to each other it's as If the queuing public don't exist...,Ledras
30,"This is a crossing point ?From Cyprus to CyprusThe point is that Cyprus wAs invaded and split into two parts,,Nice to visit and see all the islandBut I did not leave thinking it is two partsIt's a small island that has been riot apart",Ledras
50,"don't forget your passport. see both sides of Nicosia, sadly divided, a shame that the two cultures are split",Ledras
30,It's a must to visit and have your passport checked twice in 20 metres. Better to go when it's hot not Feb. The Cypriot people however are wonderfully friendly and this division in the nation is sad. I wasn't motivated to wander far into the Turkish side and soon turned back,Ledras
50,"Quick Walk over into the north, walk up passed the shops, a lovely mosque and market. Worth seeing. Nice friendly cafés, very good prices",Ledras
40,"The crossing is simple and fairly efficient. If leaving the Greek side your passport is checked and then it's a 100 m walk to the Turkish passport control, through an early quiet no mans land!The Turks check your passport and give you a simple form to fill; you will only complete your name and they fill in your passport number. They stamp that form, and on your return do it again. No passport stamps.It's well worth a few hours in the northern side. Pick up a map in the booth just after the Turkish control point. It's all easily doable on foot, and mirrors the walls of the southern side.",Ledras
40,"Our group did not need a visa to enter into Turkish Cyprus. Before crossing 'the Green Line' on the right is part of 'No Man's Land' which has remained untouched since 1974ish. It is marked off with sandbags, barrels and barbed wire which definitely gives the area a ’ghost town' feel. As for the crossing it was easy. If visiting Cyprus seeing both the Turkish and Greek sides is a must!",Ledras
40,"The old city of Nicosia surrounded by the historic Venetian walls, offers a pleasant experience for tourist visitors. It incorporates shops, cafes, shopping mall, tourist shopping, restaurants, old Byzantine Church, basically along and near the pedestrian streets of Ledra and Onasagorou.",Ledras
50,"If you ever come to Cyprus, your major interests would usually be sun sea sand focused. But you'd miss out on a whole lot if you fail to pass through the Ledra Street Crossing Point, the pedestrian crossing gate of the last divided capital in Europe. The old city is split into half with a buffer zone and north and south of the the city are quite different. The south is more of a modern nature with international shops and restaurants whereas the north has a more oriental feel, with lots of historical must see spots standing as if they were lost in time. Don't miss it. As it would be one of the most important experiences of your visit.",Ledras
30,"This site is basically the crossing point to Turkish Cyprus, so physically there's not much to see except a little shack manned by policemen. However, it's a must go point for anyone visiting the area, as it clearly shows the complexity in this small island.",Ledras
30,"Just a step and you are out of a country and into another one.The boarder line is just demarcated with a blue ribbon I guess, ions hardly know that he is at a boarder until the immgration ask u of a Visa... Lol",Ledras
50,"A beautiful street - Ledras - for a walk to relax. Lots of shops (modern and traditional), cafes and restaurants in the mixed old - new buildings! Very sad to stop at the barricade in Ledras after the Turks invention in the country in1974 and still occupated by them since the war making Nicosia the only devided capital in the EE. Do Not recommend crossing to the occupied half of Cyprus - its like you accept it as a different country and also its dangerous!",Ledras
50,"Quite easy now to cross over to the Turkish side. the crossing has been cleaned up overthe last 4/5 years and, unless you meet a coach party, takes little time to go through. Worth it just to see the real difference between the two sides. The Mosque is interesting and the clothes are very reasonable (yes they are fake but so what). Most restaurants are very good value.",Ledras
30,"Its a shame to see a country still split in half by the turkish invasion that happened in 1974. Its all very nice walking through Ledra street shops, cafes, shopping and the sights the history. Until you get to the end of the street and to cross to the other side were the turkish border is they want to see passports. You are not permitted if you do not have one with you. Lets face it your not actually leaving Cyprus your still in the same country.",Ledras
40,Efficien and quick. Unfortunately they also found I had an outstanding warrant for speeding during a previous visit to the Northern Military occupied area some years agao!I understand that this is not uncommon.We were visiting the Whirling Dervish Temple which is open daily.,Ledras
50,"For anyone visiting Nicosia from the Cypriot side, this is a worthwhile trip.You must have your passport and get your slip of paper with entry stamp,There is no problem with buying items in the Turkish quarter and bringingthem back to the Cypriot side.The contrast between the two halves of the city is stark.This is the only divided City in the world at the moment and well worth a tripacross the green line...",Ledras
40,"The point where South and North Cyprus allow foot access. Just seems a pity that this has to be here. All along the streets either side of the crossing are oil drums, barbed wire and sandbags to stop crossings elsewhere nearby. Also there are also NATO soldiers floating about to bring home the fact that there needs to be a peacekeeping force in this lovely country.",Ledras
30,If you're into history then it's interesting. Quaint shops and houses in the area. Nothing amazing but has historical value.,Ledras
40,"I was on this crossing point more times than I care to remember & found it easy to across once you have your passport, they will give you a piece of paper with a stamp in it & you hand this back on your return, don't let any stamp go into your own passport as this is only recognized in Turkey & could cause problems outside of Cyprus.I found the comparison similar to walking back to the 1980's with comparisons between the shops, the decor & the friendliness of the staff on the North-side of Cyprus is more obvious in the restaurants & shops makes it more enjoyable to eat there at half the price.",Ledras
50,This quite insignificant looking guard point brings home the separation of the island. If you wish to go into the Turkish area you will require your passport and a completed visa application. Walking almost up to this point on the right is a small street leading off Ledra Street and there in front of you is a sandbagged and barbwired barrier with a view of both sides of the island in stark contrast. The Greek side full of people enjoying a day out shopping and meeting friends and on the other side houses looking empty and neglected. It must break the hearts of everyone that was resident in places where people had lived in harmony for generations to be uprooted and relocated somewhere strange to them.,Ledras
40,"There was not a long queue so it did not take me long to cross to the Turkish side. I cannot judge the quality of the products as I was told to avoid buying products from the Turkish side as they might be thrown away by the immigration on the Greek side.I enjoyed seeing the attractions on the Turkish side (Selimiye Mosque, Buyuk Han etc) and having delicious Turkish food for much lower prices.",Ledras
30,"Not really an attraction, it is a crossing at the end of Ledra street - which used to be the most commercial street in Nicosia before the turkish invasion - leading to the occupied part of Nicosia which is the only remaining devided capital in the European Union thanks to the self isolated occupied part. Let's say a kind of Checkpoint Charlie, however this time, leading to an illegal occupied area.Politics apart, a few minutes walk into the occupied part, one can see the colonial buildings of UK era, and the simple life in Cyprus and taste local dishes . May I correct reviewers , there is no such thing as Greek or Turkish side unless they refer to the turkish- occupied part of the city.",Ledras
50,"It takes minutes to cross from one side to the other. You need a valid passport and nothing more then filling a short form on the Turkish side. A lot of tourist information, maps and guides are given on the Turkish side and you're just in the middle of everything.",Ledras
30,"Not much to it. Easy to cross to the other side and worth making the crossing for the sake of seeing the Turkish-occupied side. Building there are similar (unsurprisingly), though less well maintained.",Ledras
30,"Had a wander down to the crossing took a few pictures and that was it realy. Didn't bother crossing over but it was very quiet. Definately worth a look if your in the area but nothing special. Just around the corner from the crossing point is an abandoned street from the time of the conflict complete with oil drums, sand bags and barbed wire to stop you venturing beyond.",Ledras
20,"It's a border crossing, at the end of a street full of tacky tourist shops - not what I would call a tourist attraction!However, if you are a pedestrian crossing into the disputed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus this really is the only option as it is the sole pedestrian crossing point.The ""no man's land"" - an area of empty buildings between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot border controls is a bit eery, as it so empty and devoid of life, compared with the hustle and bustle on both sides of the border.It was extremely busy on the day that we were there (Greek Independence Day) and so took an age to cross, but there are some interesting sites on the northern side, and so is worth the trip, just get here at a quieter time.",Ledras
30,"Really I feel like giving this one star because it's sad that in the 21st century this should even be necessary, but it's all mired up in politics unfortunately.. You stand in a Q clutching your passport (don't forget this) and fill in a bit of paper with brief details of your passport which the Turkish customs then stamp. The paper is necessary because the Greek Cypriots can throw a wobbly if you have a stamp from the Turkish side in your actual passport. What a total farce, but as I said this is all about politics. You are then allowed through and the first thing that strikes you is the tattiness of the Turkish side. Venture a bit further and you will see signs of real poverty amongst the crumbling buildings. Returning you get the bit of paper stamped again and then you wave it in front of the Greek customs person and all being well you will be let through. Don't expect smiles from anyone on either side during this depressing experience, no doubt there are rules that forbid this. And don't take photos anywhere near the border or of the security folk or you are likely to be arrested and worse. Is it worthwhile - yes I think it is even if only to thank your lucky stars you don't have to live there.",Ledras
30,"There is not much to it. Except the fact that it is a real-world crossing from a free zone to an occupied part of a tiny island. Time may have stood still immediately around the crossing. But on each side, life goes on as usual.The fact that the crossings are now open to the general public from either side also makes it feel like any regular border crossing. A walk along the edge of various parts of the UN buffer zone was far more intense than the actual Ledra crossing. The abandoned homes and shops, derelict buildings, the abandoned airport. There is more to see around than just the crossing point.",Ledras
50,"Is one of seven crossing points between South and North parts of Cyprus, and open for pedestrians only.It is here where the most tourists visiting the south Cypriot part of Lefkosia/Nikosia can cross the border and walk over to the north part of the city, currently under Turkish occupation.For now it is easy to cross the border, you need to have your passport with you and you can get a visum at once in one of the kiosks serving as passport-control posts on the both sides of the border. Lines can be long but controls are operating quickly and do not take long time.In my opinion it can be very interesting to visit the Ledra museum-observatory on the 11th floor of Shacolas Tower (address is Ledra 171), and see whole Lefkosia/Nikosia from above (see pictures attached).",Ledras
50,"Go relatively early in the morning before the crowds pick up. Easy, no fuss crossing. Fill in the paper and enjoy",Ledras
50,"It felt just amazing to be standing there at the border, just merely 1 min after you were strolling on a busy shopping street full of cafes and trendy stores.As if you were changing countries, civilization and an entire mindset in a couple of minutes waiting in line for the passport control...Really interesting, definitely worth the tingling on your back :)",Ledras
50,Having crossed between Turkish and Greek borders with security police one feels like in a Jamies Bond movie from '70's. Both sides seem to be relaxed and settled in their own worlds. Peaceful. Lucky UN Peacekeepers I said to myself as there was nothing much to do for them apparently!,Ledras
50,"-well worth a visit, if hopping ex war sites is your scene - try Famagusta too... for more bullet scenes and shell damage..",Ledras
40,"Nothing too exciting about the crossing point (unless you forget to take your passport). Nicosia is the last divided capital city in the Europe and the areas just off Ledra street are a stark reminder of the troubles that affected this island in recent history.The contrasts are strong, within a 300 metre distance you can go from the modern commercial / shopping area to the back streets which now mainly house small workshops or are derelict ruins. these are like stepping back in time 40 years, as lots of the premises border the buffer zone and are largely unchanged since the early 70s.You can get a good view of the city (both sides) from the Shacolas tower, which is accessed from down the side of the Debenhams store on Ledra street.",Ledras
30,"We were travelling from Larnaca to Kyrenia. Good bus service in the south to Nicosia, then a walk from the bus station along the pedistrianised Ledras Street. Last chance to sample branded food franchises (not our choice) before crossing over to the north. Short queue but no option but a stamp in our passports and no visa. Facilities on the Greek side were totally relaxed and no queue. Another 20 minute walk to find a Combus (communal taxi) Location poster is on the wall behind you as you pass the street. The locals on both sides of the border are helpful and the total cost of travelling from South coast to north coast about £10.",Ledras
50,The closest you might feel perhaps to Check-Point Charlie. The last divided city in Europe. Bullet holes in abandoned flats with the washing still on display. A sad reminder for the safe tourist of fractured humanity.,Ledras
40,"Located at the end of Ledras street, in the heart of the old town , full of shops and cafe-restaurants. For tourists is not actually an attraction, but the point to show them that Nicosia is the only divided capital in Europe. They learn about Turkish Invation in Cyprus and is the point that let them go to the occupied by Turks, part of Nicosia town. For locals there is much pain from unhappy memories of the war. I think is time this wall not to exist anymore, like the wall of Berlin and all Cypriots, Greeks and Turks be together as were at the old happy times.",Ledras
30,"Nothing exciting, just some airport like barriers and if you weren't careful you would completely miss it. Didn't venture to the other side as we left our passports back in the hotel.",Ledras
50,"love the shops and they have wonderful coffee shops and nice restaurants and is really very cozy , it is a mixture of old and new .. love it",Ledras
30,its the crossing point most pedestrian make to croos from Turkish Cyprus to the Greek part. The last divided capital in the world!not as dramtic a crossing as former East/West Berlin but sad still the same!,Ledras
50,Head to this point of historical importance and modern misfortune which divides the island's capital into two.,Ledras
10,"How does an establishment which is ultimately the result of a military invasion, qualify as an attraction? It is merely a road in which a visitor's passport is chequed in order to enter or exit the occupied north of the Republic of Cyprus. Nothing interesting or attractive or pretty as far as I am concerned.",Ledras
40,"This is a place to take a photo featuring the plate ""Last European Divided Capital"". Nothing particularly special about the monument - just the feeling.",Ledras
50,"This was a fascinating day out, and probably the highlight of our week in Paphos. We got the 8am Intercity bus from Karavella, and returned on the 4pm bus. Each journey took 2 hours, and it cost 13 euros for a return ticket.We went straight to the Ledra Street crossing – about 10 minutes’ walk – and passed through the passport control point without any problems. It was sad to see the derelict buildings on the short walk through ‘No Man’s Land’. There was an information kiosk on entering the Turkish side, where we picked up maps and informative leaflets.We love Turkey – just as much as we love Greece and Cyprus – and immediately felt as if we had returned to Turkey within the space of a few minutes! The atmosphere was just ‘different’. I won’t make any comments re historical events, the Selime Mosque etc. There are obviously a lot of controversial opinions, even here on the TA site. You need to see North Nicosia for yourself before you decide what you think.Anyway, as a day out as tourists, we loved the experience! We loved the Turkish atmosphere; the friendly Turkish Cypriot people; the Buyuk Han; the Sedirhan restaurant; the little shops selling Turkish cushion covers, purses etc; the peaceful squares around the mosque; the Food Market and the Bazaar; the Eaved House and courtyard, etc. Everything about the central area of North Nicosia was just delightful, and so tranquil – enhanced by the Muezzin’s Call to Prayer from the Selime Mosque. Unfortunately, we didn't know about the Whirling Dervish performances. It was a shame to have missed this.Wandering out from the centre, we saw the houses and living conditions of the local people. Again, you need to see for yourselves before deciding what you think. Whilst wandering these back-streets, we were greeted by several groups of little kids. They all welcomed us in English, and made us feel quite ashamed of our inability to respond in Turkish.We didn’t change money for Turkish Lira. We might have saved a bit if we had, but we were quite happy with the prices we paid in euros for Turkish cushion covers (25 euros for 4); embroidered shoulder-purses (just 1 euro each); and a wonderful lunch at Sedirhan @ 30 euros for two, including drinks.We loved our holiday in Paphos, and on our next visit we will definitely consider basing ourselves in North Cyprus.",Ledras
40,"This crossing point is very easy, if you can miss the queues at the TRNC booth! The briefest of walks brings you to the ""other side"" but as you do so, spare of thought for those affected by this awful situation.",Ledras
40,It is always nice to go across to see the other side of Nicosia a different style of culture and different kinds of shops. Very well worth going.,Ledras
50,Good restaurants.Nice down town shops and very good place for walking and shopping from varieties of clothes shop.Ziad,Ledras
40,"The street itself is just like an ordinary shopping street, but if you have time, I would suggest you to cross the border and go straight to the North. This is especially the case during the morning peak hours as you may encounter many tour groups from cruise ships. The Northern part is more interesting after all.",Ledras
40,"We used this crossing whilst on holiday and although you need to queue at Checkpoint Charlie to be Logged In by the Turkish Police - don't forget your Passport and ""Visa"" Slip - it is well worth a visit to the Dark Side. Take time out from the various Coffee Shops, Restaurants, Souvenir Shops and Clothing Outlets to have a walk around the Green Line taking in some of the History and note the Old Damaged Buildings which still stand as a result of July 1974. There are ""You Are Here"" Points at various Locations to help you find your way around and give you some information. Well Worth the effort and you can feel the atmosphere as you walk down some of the empty streets and at times a feeling of being watched. Stop off for a Cold one and a Spot of Lunch in one of the Turkish food places, well worth the effort. Try it and you'll enhance your Cypriot Visit.",Ledras
40,"It was very easy crossing into Northern Cyprus through the Ledra street crossing. Unfortunately we arrived the same time as a tour bus full of people and that caused some delay at the passport control area.Interesting seeing the difference between the two sides. Clothing is very cheap and you are reminded to be careful when buying brand names as there are a lot of counterfeit products sold and it can be confiscated when you cross back into the Greek side.We visited the Selemi mosque and enjoyed a show of the Swirling Dervish - 7 Euro - we were also told the story of the Dervish by a lady who did her best with broken English. We enjoyed it very much.We had a lovely lunch at the Arts and Crafts building close to the mosque. 10 Euro for a lovely beef and vegetable dish with cheese on top, big salad, pita bread, beer and two turkish coffees!Well worth doing the trip to the Turkish side?",Ledras
40,Crossing from one side of Cyprus to the other occupied side is interesting and all the people at the check point were nice & helpful.When we went this time it was very quick as there was no queue .I think it is something that you need to experience for yourself to really appreciate.,Ledras
40,"Take the opportunity to at least see if not pass through the border crossing in the only divided city centre from vibrant and busy Greek Cyprus into flat and lifeless Turkish Cyprus. See what has happened to the great Sophie cathedral built in the 1200's, see the abandoned shops and houses in the very city centre. Look into the once grand Venetian palace turned into empty restaurants. Be pleased you can return to Cyprus proper. We went in the evening, pre dinner, and the difference was stark. Remember to take your passport!",Ledras
20,"Well this is a historical and popular point for tourist and for greeks or cypriots citizen because the Turkish invasion (1974). The street today is a simple tourist point, very noisy with many shops and so much people specially the summer season for walking, drink coffee or eating in a little expensive area. The Lesra street is close to Popular Neighbourhood that is so poor without effort to make it better.",Ledras
40,"Have your passport ready, fill in visa details and that's it done your your through into northern Nicosia. Remember you must leave by the same crossing and the exit is just as easy get visa stamped and you're through.",Ledras
50,"Nicosia is probably the last divided capital in the world.At Ledra Street Crossing Point, people can pass (walking only - no cars) from the Cypriot side to the Turkish side and vice versa.A valid passport is requested.Cars can pass at another crossing point.It is very interesting to walk some hundred meters away from the Crosing Point, on both sides of the border, away from the tourist-area, looking arround, understanding the different quality-of-life, and hoping for good.",Ledras
50,"I agree with much of what the other reviews have said so will not repeat, but instead give some information which is not given in other reviews and might help with your visit to Nicosia.Getting to Nicosia from the south could not be easier. Follow the A1 motorway which then leads into the dual carriage way B1. Keep following this virtually straight road keeping to the directions ‘Town Centre’.About 3km from the centre you will pass an M&S ‘Café la Mode’ on the left and then about half a kilometre from your destination your will pass another M&S, again on the left. Immediately after this there is a car park.We missed this and continued to follow signs for the Town Centre. This takes you to a one way system around the Plateia Solomou where the bus station is and also another car park. Somehow we managed to miss the entrance to the car park and found ourselves about to head out of town in the direction we came from. However just past the bus station on the left after the traffic lights is a derelict piece of land which is a temporary car park. We parked there for 6 euros for the day.Standing in this car park looking to the town centre you can see some trees about 300m to the right. This is the start of Ledra Street. The tallest building you can see is the Shacolas Tower. The first 6 floors of this building are occupied by Debenhams and there is a lovely café on the 6th floor. On the 11th floor is a museum and observatory which gives panoramic views over the city. This is well worth a visit. The museum is not up to much but the views are. It costs 2 euros to enter. Access is either from the Debenhams café or if you take the road to the right by the side of Debenhams there is an entrance there. The toilets in both the café and on the 11th floor are both well maintained and free.The contrast between Greek and Turkish sides of the ‘green line’ is something to see and as you cross through the green line you get the best views of the dereliction of the building in the green line. Don’t forget you passports and don’t except any friendliness from the Turkish border guards. Crossing the green line really brings home the division of the country, but to be fair, all of the Turkish Cypriots that we spoke to wanted reunification.",Ledras
40,"An interesting experience. No problems just show passport and some paperwork. Much busier and crowded on Greek side. Turkish side has many little shops and purses and clothes are CHEAP! Like 10 euros for a good knock off designer t shirt. Many, many ""designer"" handbags. It's fun to browse. Greek side items are way, way too expensive. Even Starbucks! 6 euros for a coffee, are they kidding? No!",Ledras
50,"I believe this is the only divided city still in existence. To the south is the Greek Cypriot area and to the north the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus. Crossing the border is easy and all you have to do is walk across and get your passport stamped. The passport control and customs are all very efficient and polite and I think whether visiting the north or south you should go across and see what it's like on the other side. Both sides have loads of shopping, but the atmosphere is totally different and you can buy different types of things on both sides. The Turkish side has loads of jewellers, clothes and handbag shops whilst the Greek side has shoes galore, more chain stores and more European style things. Restaurants, shops, facilities on both sides are great. The architecture is fascinating. Most shops take euro on both sides and credit cards. The Turkish side uses Turkish Lira as well as euro but I don't think you can use Turkish currency in the south. There are some fabulous and historical sites to visit in the north such as the Buyuk Han, Selime Mosque and the Bazaar. All of these things can be reached quickly and easily on foot as they are all located close to the border.",Ledras
50,"The Ledra Street crossing point between the two sides of the divided city of Nicosia, Cyprus is very easy and well managed by the Greek Cypriots on the one side and the Turkish Cypriots on the other. I crossed dozens times with absolutely no problems. There are very interesting sites to visit on the less-well known northern side, that is the culturally Turkish city and there are interesting places to eat. People are friendly and accommodating and many speak English.",Ledras
40,"We visited Nicosia (or Lefkosia) whilst on holiday staying in Pissouri, (Southern Cyprus), and wanted to cross over to the Northern part of the city occupied by the Turkish to see the main attractions such as the bazaar, the Selime Mosque and the Buyuk Han.Arriving into Nicosia by car, (about a 1.5 hour drive from Pissouri taking the A6 and A1 motorways), we parked in the 'Tripoli Bastion' Car Park located in the S.W. part of the old city, just across the street from the Holiday Inn Hotel. Parking costs something like 0.50 Euro per hour, (we paid 3.50 Euro for 5 hours), and you get a ticket on arrival and pay at a pay machine before you leave.From this car park it is just a 5 minute walk Eastwards to Lidras Street. Once on Lidras Street you just turn left and walk North for about 10 minutes and you will reach the Border Crossing Point... You can't miss it!! Note: this crossing point is for pedestrians only. Cars have to cross at another border check-point to the West of Nicosia, (See notes below).The crossing process was easy for us but that may vary depending on what Passport you hold. We are British Passport holders and it was very simple. You approach passport control they then check and stamp your passport (or a Visa on a piece of paper if you prefer) and you are in Turkisk occupied Northern Nicosia, or Lefkosa as it is also known.We spent about 3 hours in Lefkosa then crossed back into Southern (Cypriot) Nicosia, again a very simple and smooth process involving showing your Pasport again and having an exit stamp placed in it.Later in the same day we crossed into Northern Cyprus in our rental car which we had to do at the Border Check Point at 'Agios Dometois' which is about a 10 minute drive to the West of Nicosia. This process was again easy but you have to purchase Car Insurance if in a Rental Car at the checkpoint which costs 20 Euros and covers you for 3 days. So take your rental paperwork, passport and drivers license with you. We then drove up to Kyrenia which took about 20 minutes or so and was lovely (See my other reviews).",Ledras
50,"No problem - as long as you have a passport - a touch of 'is that it?' to be honest. A largish policeman with cigarette and coffee in hand stamped us through from the exotic bazaars of the north to the busy western street of the south, and an hour or so later a lovely lady stamped me back through.",Ledras
40,"come on...you goto try this, just for the stamp in your passport. it was well worth seeing the different cultures too. greek Cyprus is much nicer though!",Ledras
50,"We spend one afternoon, on Saturday, on Ledra Street in Nicosia and once we arrived at the crossing point we were asked to complete one small paper with our name, passport or id number, nationality and vehicle number if it is the case. After this they asked for our passports and that's all. When we came back from the turkish side they also checked our passports. So everthing was normal and without any problems.",Ledras
40,"as an EU citizen i passed only with my Identity Card (No passport needed it)I recommend to pass from the Greek Cyprus part to the Turkish part. The Greek side didn't do any control.is very easy to reach Girne (Kirenia) Gate in order to go on a minibus to Kirenia city (which definitely worth a visit) - only 30 minute journey - 9 lira return.We had low expectation of North Cyprus due to the remarks of the Greek Cyprus people - you will be surprised that they are quite open to tourism.Your euro's are good here, but i advice to use Lira.Hope that someday this two parts will reunite - and the control point will not be needed it anymore.",Ledras
30,A mixure of strange feelings for us Cypriots when we come to this crossing point. You can see both Greek and Turkish Cypriots walking or shopping together as if nothing goes on and just next to them the abandoned buildings since 1974 or even some from 1963!,Ledras
40,you can pass to the other site if u have your id with you just for the experience... nothing much but there are nice taverns around!,Ledras

50,"In your walk at Leedra you can see the architecture of the old buildings. You can enjoy your coffee at the cafeterias there, that can be either brands (starbucks) or not (diosmos kai kanella). You can do shopping as well and eat there for lunch or dinner. at the end of Leedra street, after police checking your passport you can go to the other occupied part of cyprus.",Ledras
30,"We had visitors so decided to take them over the border into the occupied area. It was a hot day and the crossing point was very busy. Of all the booths available there were only 3 actually in operation. Many people did not realise that you have to fill in a small form for immigration so the queues built up. Unfortunately, the border police do nothing to help the situation as they don't hand out the forms to people in the queue. My advice if you go there and a queue is forming is to push your way to the front and ask for some forms, then hand them out to all those in front of you. This can save a long wait in the hot sun and get you through so that you can enjoy the rustic unchanged area beyond.",Ledras
30,"I travelled from Turkey by ferry to Kyrenia where my passport was stamped. After a stay over in this beautiful Venetian town I caught the bus to Nicosia. I then walked through the Ledra checkpoint into the Greek controlled part of Nicosia and there were no problems despite the passport stamp from the North. Very strange walking from the Turkish zone into a high street of fast food and European outlets. I live in Greece but I love Turkey, and have many friends there, so it was a unique experience. I then caught the service bus to Paphos where I was meeting friends from Crete for a conventional holiday in an all inclusive hotel- not my ideal holiday, but there we go!",Ledras
40,"Travelled over on the bus from Paphos for a day trip to Nicosia. Discovered the check point after almost walking through it. Got our 90 day visa and a stamp in our passport. The Turkish border guards were very thorough checking our details against previous visits when we crossed over at different points over the years before stamping the passports.It is like going back 20 years when you get further into the city, even the prices in the bars and restaurants are 20 years behind.On returning to the check point passport were checked and stamped again. On going through the Cypriot check a cursory check was made. however we did see someone having their shopping bags checks. The border guards were obviously checking for fake goods which could be confiscated.",Ledras
30,"Nicosia is the only divided city in Europe after the invasion of the Turks in 1974.The 'green line' is the United Nations buffer zone and divides the north part where Turks live with the south.The crossing over the green line is nonstop mostly from tourists.Even Cypriots have to present their passports to cross over the line something that I found weird, but it is a fact. It is as if it is another country!I cannot say that goods are much cheaper at this side but just for the change it’s worth visiting.There are lots of small businesses selling souvenirs like in every touristy place and goods are more or less the same on both sides. Bags, clothing, goldsmiths’ shops, groceries, and restaurants are what you come across 200 metres from the line.",Ledras
40,"This is interesting ti see. There is a lot of history (posters and pictures from the war) in the short walk across the boarded. If you go to Cyprus I highly recommend crossing the at Ledra Street. It is a UN buffer zone, so I didn't take any pictures.",Ledras
40,After holidaying in Cyprus since 1993 and not having visited Nicosia for the last 8 years we were wondering around looking for the green line and the divided wall guarded by the Soldiers for several hours. Even after seeing this particular attraction we still continued looking until I went to the tourist information office and the guy in the shop opposite explained. I was astounded that you could cross over after all these years. Unfortunately not knowing this we hadn't got our passports which we were extremely disappointed about and had to make do with the viewing in Debenhams on the 11th floor (well worth a visit just for the view of all over Nicosia) We are considering travelling to Nicosia again in the next few days just so we can experience the Northern side but will see once we've entered from the Famagusta area.,Ledras
40,We visited Nicosia and were amazed and interested to see the Green Line and how it divides the city. Crossing into the north of the city is also an interesting experience including a visit to a mosque which had been converted from a Christian cathedral. Half a day in Nicosia was not enough.,Ledras
30,"If ever they get rid of this and learn compromise the island would truly flourish, the crossing is a small step but the sculpture needs to go.",Ledras
40,"It's nice to cross the border to see how time has stood still , and interesting to see bullet holes in the buildings as you cross to the other side, be warned if you buy any of the fake goods and try to walk them back over they will be confiscated, so wear whatever it is, to have any chance of getting it across",Ledras
50,Really worth a visit to see how the Green Line was drawn across the city. It is hard to imagine a capital city being divided into two halves and for nearly thirty five years the one side could not visit the other side.,Ledras
30,"First time we saw this it was from an observation point and looked across 'No Man's Land'. Extremely sad. Now it has been greatly tidied up, but it is still sobering to think that Nicosia is a divided city after 40 years. The world seems to have forgotten this. A few years ago we crossed over for an evening meal and returned when it was dark. This was an incredible experience. We crossed from the 'Occupied Zone' which is bleak and poorly-lit - through the border - and then into smartly-lit and 'buzzing' Greek Cypriot Ledra Street.",Ledras
50,"Its like stepping back in time. The whole experience is amazing, educational and interesting. It most definitely worth the visit!",Ledras
50,A smile wouldn't hurt would it? They may be bored but we were going into Northern Cyprus and spending money there ....cheer up border guards!,Ledras
30,"What is there to say about a crossing point between two parts of the only divided city in the world, apart from the fact that it is very sad. Lots of people queueing to cross over but it looked relatively painless. the location didn't seem to affect the locals (Green Cypriot side) bu I suppose that they have got used to its presence.",Ledras
50,"This was a piece of cake, contrary to dire expectations. The Turkish side was friendly, helpful, cheaper (!), and provided all manner of maps and information.",Ledras
40,"it leaves me with a strong wish that things should change one day, and not too far out, rather sooner, to end this plight.I stay away from discussing who started it all, its complex but I sympathize with the Cypriots who say this is an occupation, nothing simpler than that.Its history at works, when you cross remember the iron curtain that had a hole in Berlin.",Ledras
10,"The background as described few months ago from another traveller:""Turkey invated Cyprus in July 1974, divided the island by military force into two parts ,the Northen and Southern parts, and forced the Greek Cypriots who were living in the Northen part of the country to leave their homeplaces and became refugees in their own country.The Northen part of the island is still under the occupation and control of Turkey, thirty nine years after the Turkish invation. The Green Line at the bottom of the Ledra street is a pure example of what the Turkish military forces did on the ground from East to West.""There is nothing good in all this at the first place.Considering the local people's feelings, it is really horrible to experience a procedure like passing borders to cross your own city/country and find all streets renamed by Turkish to ""sokak"" trying to prove their violation and their lack of culture or civilization.Instead of crossing the point, better submit a signed protest or turn your back.This is not an attraction but a disgrace.",Ledras
50,"Ledra Street Crossing Point is right in the middle of the old city. The fact that makes this attraction so unique is that south of it you will find european shops, tavernas, churches, greek alphabet and you will pay in euro; but in the other parth you will find bazaars, shaorma fast-foods, mosques and you will pay in turkish lira (even so, they will accept euro as well). You must have your ID card (only for EU citizens) or Passport (for non-EU citizens), you must complete a visa-form on a piece of paper and then you must wait for the police officer to put the stamp on the visa paper (keep it safe, cos you must presented on your way back to South Cyprus). Be careful, cos there are no photos allowed close to the Green Line or to the customs and you don't want to have your camera confiscated.",Ledras
50,We crossed the border easily ....I asked for my passport to be stamped but you can also enter with a paper visa. The border staff were very friendly on both sides. The difference between the two sides was stark and incredibly interesting. A definite must if you're in Nicosia.,Ledras
50,Easy procedure lots to see both sides and different cultures to experience worth a visit to see and do,Ledras
50,"Very easy to do and interesting once you get across! Fill out a visa at the immigration desk which is stamped, and you're on your way! Lots of copy clothing, bags etc and plenty of places to eat and drink. Money changers with reasonable rates are plentiful. We ate at The Old Mosaic which ended up being less than ideal, but there are lots of places to choose from, and plenty of things to see.",Ledras
50,"It costs nil to cross over the border. In a week, I crossed over four times. You need your passport. You can either have a stamp in and another stamp out, in your passport, or complete a slip of paper, that can be stamped and then binned after your re-entry to the South.I knew that I would be visiting the north of the city and ensured that I had Turkish lira with me. But they do accept euros and there are several exchange bureaus as you cross over.",Ledras
40,We crossed twice as found the Turkish side of Nicosia much cheaper and more interesting. The border is straightforward. Ask for the stamp on a piece of paper and don't lose it! A totally different atmosphere which was really enjoyable. We had a wander around some local streets and it was fascinating to see how people live here. There is also a good view of the buffer zone which is eerie but fascinating. Agree with another reviewer who suggested getting back over the border before dark. It is quite easy to get lost in the tiny streets and it was a bit intimidating at night.,Ledras
30,"Turkey invated Cyprus in July 1974, divided the island by military force into two parts ,the Northen and Southern parts, and forced the Greek Cypriots who were living in the Northen part of the country to leave their homeplaces and became refugees in their own country. The Northen part of the island is still under the occupation and control of Turkey, thirty nine years after the Turkish invation. The Green Line at the bottom of the Ledra street is a pure example of what the Turkish military forces did on the ground from East to West. Apart from the experience that will be gained by the visitor regarding the only one divided city in the world he will also be able to enjoy the Cypriot cousine as a number of restaurants and cafeterias are spread around in the area. In addition a shopping centre and a number of gifts and novelties shops are also available on the Ledra street for shopping therapy.",Ledras
10,"Just don't go there. There is nothing to see or do. Unless you like old buildings, which are plenty on this side.",Ledras
50,A walk in old town is very nice either during the summer time late in the afternoon or early in the day during winter.,Ledras
40,"The title shouldnt be about 'border' crossing, because that would mean one is crossing the border of two countries. What you are crossing here is the enforced GreenLine between the free part of Cyprus and the occupied by the Turkish troops part. There is no border to mention. Cyprus is one country, globally(except Turkey) aknowledged to be the only legal entity on the island. What people need to understand is that when they cross they enter an illegal entity aknowledged only by Turkey and Azerbaijhan!!",Ledras
40,"It's like walking down any busy city pedestrian street lined with shops and cafes. Then you see the Police hut and border crossing signs. But the other side looks the same. The back streets nearby have beautiful old buildings decaying and you see armed personnel guarding bits of wall to the No Man's Land. Lots of ""no photos"" signs.",Ledras
40,"Having been to Berlin pre unification, and also in Nicosia when it was divided, this was a bit weirdYou must take your passport and go to the control booth & fill out forms.There is an eery feeling as you walk along and start to pass the buffer zone. Homes, now ruins, in decay, a ghost town in parts. Then you walk and enter the Turkish side. Sign posts tell you what you need to know, and you following accordingly, but there is a marked difference between the sides and it's noticeable.Plenty of shops, and people vying for your trade.A bit tacky, and in disrepair, doesn't warrant a very long time across there.En route back again you must have your passport checked by the Turkish .",Ledras
40,"We went to the border crossing mainly so that we could go back and see our family home and work places now destroyed crumbling buildings occupied by the turkish army. it is a sad reality of the situation. People should really understand that this division is not a matter of ethnicity or religions clashing, as for hundreds of years turks and cypriots were living together all across the island in harmony. this is something to remember. no issues crossing just follow the instructions of the soldiers.",Ledras
40,"To get in you simply need to get your passport stamped. However, be sure that on exiting whichever side you cross to that you 'check out' with passport control or this can cause problems if you ever need to cross again!Euro is accepted on both sides of the border however there is a currency change booth near passport control where you can obtain Turkish Lira if that's what you want.The Turkish side is much cheaper - the people are friendly and the shops are independent. However, bare in mind that much of the branded clothing in these shops may be counterfeit.",Ledras
30,"If you want to cross the borders from the greek-cypriot part of Nicosia to the occupied one of the north you just have to show your passport and complete some personal information in a piece of paper and then you go. You don't have to pay anything at all. Keep this paper in order to get back! Apart from the above, this place reminds you so loudly that Nicosia is a divided capital and the feeling is so overwhelming if you stand still and think of what a border station really means in the center of the capital of Cyprus.",Ledras
50,"I have walked along this street many a time crossing from one end of street to the other over the years since the crossing opened. The differences between the two sides diminishes with each visit. The Greek side has the euro and more commonly recognised shops and restaurants (Debenhams, Starbucks etc..) The Turkish side has the Turkish lira and is more unique with mainly independent shops and restaurants. Doesn't sound too interesting so far, the fact of the matter is that you need to be aware of the history and have a good knowledge of the issues which have led to this boarder being constructed. If you can arm your self with an unbiased view and walk across slowly, you can almost feel the sadness behind the modern 2 sides of this city, the desperate circumstances which led to the divisions and now the hesitant steps taken by the united nations to provide common ground for these two stricken communities to begin to share and grow links again. As you walk across, look around you at some of the people and faces crossing the street with you, some who have lost homes and lives they had on one side and can only now visit as tourists, some visiting streets they grew up in and can no longer live in...think about how you are playing your part in this history by being there and you may just gain an emotional glimpse and understanding of the concept this crossing represents.",Ledras
30,"We we staying in Paphos and took the hire car to Nicosia for a bit of sightseeing and shopping, whilst there we thought we would go north for a look. The boarder guards were friendly and it was one of the easiest crossings I have had for some time. When you get into the north the first sight and probably the last is groups of men sitting around everywhere many of whom are having a few beers. The whole area is decaying and crumbling this a sharp contrast to the south of the city, you are left in no doubt that you are in an area of special needs. Not for everybody.",Ledras
40,It doesn't look like anything special but the history and idea of it all is a good experience. You walk north on Lidra street visiting all the shops along the way until you come to the crossing. When entering to the occupied north you have to be careful they do not stamp your passport for legal reasons; if they do stamp it there is a good chance you will need a new one. Once on the north there are more shops with knock off goods for pretty cheap and the atmosphere is very different and definitely worth a visit. It can feel a bit sketchy at nighttime so I recommend getting there well before sunset.,Ledras
40,"Have approached the Border from both sides - but from the North it feels more real, its hard to understand after all these years that a small Island is still divided. In the Northern side its good to explore but beware the Soldiers will approach you with loaded weapons and ask you what you are doing, a scary feeling. The island is beautiful and the Northern towns, beaches and sights are lovely - go if you can",Ledras
50,"A mixture of ancient and modern, a beautiful city torn in two by a border checkpoint yet the locals are happy and hopeful for the future of a united cyprus with no division of land or people.If you go to the 4th floor of debenhams on Ledra st there is a viewing room where you can get a fantastic birds eye view of all the city. In the distance carved in to the side of the mountains is a poignant reminder of the cities and indeed Cyprus's great division..... A giant Turkish flag.",Ledras
50,"I have gone to a bookstore close to Ledra border crossing and have found that the bookstore has been combined with a Coffee shop. I have visited the shop quite often in my yearly travels and am impressed with the owner as a living book of knowledge and idealism as far as the future of Cyprus goes. I am always touched by people who fit perfectly with what they do. After all books have so many ideas, hopes , worries ,Solutions and they live from the fact that as we do that we are both here to look after each other. So The owner who took a great interest and time to look after me in inquiring about my hopes and thoughts for the world in general made me feel as I wasa colleague rather than a guest . I Look foward to going back and resuming our talks from where we left off and recommend anyone in Nicosia to do the same.",Ledras
30,Crossing the border is a must just to experience it if you never saw the Berlin Wall. The narrow UN controlled zone is an eye opener.,Ledras
40,"We were interested to go and cross to the North, more curiousity than tourism. Ledra st. it self is nice, coffee shops, restaurants, stores.. good for an afternoon stroll. The corssing was uneventful. The Turks ask if you want your passport stamped (say no), they give you a paper with an entry stamp instead.Walking through the Turkish side, coffee shops, stores, signs in Turkish, the flags of north Cyprus and Turkey. We walked around, took pictures in the main square, looked around.. One difference is that you see mosques and hear the call to the prayer. Other than that you can tell you're still in Nicosia.Walked back to the Greek side, asked if we came through Larnaca (otherwise they won't let you in), we said yes, they checked our passports and we were in. Did some shopping, had coffee and ice cream and off to the bus station.One thing you realize is that it is one country/one city, and that reconciliation must prevail; people from different ethnic/religious backgrounds can live together. Wishing the people of Cyprus peace. Good luck.",Ledras
40,"Do not miss the Museum of Cyprus.There was no problem crossing over on Ledra Street.The Turkish part of Nicosia Centre is quite interesting.I visited the Selymie Mosque,attended the spinning dervis performance and walked around the Buyuk Han.I will go there again as this time I was in a hurry.",Ledras
40,"Because of its uniqueness, Ledra Street Border is worth to visit. You can cross the border when you show your passport to the Greek or Turkish police.Before 1974, Ledra Street was the main shopping street for Cypriots.After the check point had been opened,people started to go to the local shops, eat in traditional restaurants and visit the historical places again.There is a restoration and renovation process going on on the buildings which were damaged throughout the decades .It is a strange feeling to walk among these buildings and as a local of the island, I highly recommend the experience.",Ledras
20,"It is a good experience to walk 2 the crossing point created by the free cyprus but reality hits hard as you witness the last divided capital in the world. Reading about a historic event ,like an invasion is very different than actual seeing it. A real eye opener,as much of the world stood back while this happened.",Ledras
30,"Within meters you cross centuries! Free area of Nicosia is just like any other old but modern city. The occupied area of Nicosia is like stepping back in time. Don't try to enter the free areas from the northern part as it is considered illegal and you not be allowed. Strange as a monument or attraction! Used to the the Nicosia ""wall"" of separation. Unique experience.",Ledras
10,This is not something to review. it is black mark on the history of Cyprus and should be removed from tripadvisor.,Ledras
40,"Crossing to the other side is relatively easy, but in the summer months be prepared to wait in line. Do not forget your passport, of course. Greek Cypriots do not really like hearing about anyone going to the other side, and I do not blame them. The Turkish part of Cyprus is recognized solely by Turkey.",Ledras
10,"Not an attraction, just a crossing point! Greek side works easily enough, although recently they check on what's being brought across and will confiscate any illegally copied good or excess cigarettes ect, there are often queues on the Turkish side and do not come through the Turkish side without being stamped out or you will have problems if you want to go back.",Ledras
40,"This is at the middle of a shopping street, half of it in the occupied by the Turks part of the island, the other half in the Republic of Cyprus EU. It is interesting, becasue you just make few steps and you are outside of the country... you can experience in just 1 hour 2 diffurent cultures... I would recommend a tour of Old Nicosia (Cypriot Greek part), then a coffee and sweet stop again in Free Cyprus, then a tour on the shops in Ledra Street in the Free part of Cyprus, then crossing the border, seeing aroun on the other side (occupied by Turks), and coming back for lunch on the Cypriot free side again. Food and everything in general is much safer in the free side - EU... For multiple reasons, some cultural, others hygienic, yet others... just civilization, EU regulations etc...",Ledras
40,"Being a local and a greek-cypriot I will try to avoid any prejudice. The Ledra steet border crossing is unique in that in a matter of a few steps (not more than 10 meters) you feel that you change epoch and culture. The Ledra street or ""makridromos"" translated into ""the long street"" leeds to the crossing. Getting there one passes a large number of shops and cafes in a street that traffic is not allowed except on foot. The people walking in the street come from all places , Greeks, Turks, and tourists from everywhere. It does look like a middle-eastern bazaar road gradually becoming so as you approach the crossing and definitely after the crossing. After the crossing the middle-east bazaar atmosphere is definite.",Ledras
50,"Ledra street is not border Crossing as the word BORDER will be used for 2 states which there is not 2 states in the republic of Cyprus at all. Cyprus is one and North Cyprus is under occupation from 1974 till present. you can see after 38 years the consequences of war still exist. What a pity!Ledra Street is a shopping Center and historical place, full of restaurants with different cuisines and you can buy souvenirs for your friends from this Lovely Island. The shops open on Sundays also.",Ledras
50,The last divided city in the European Union! Hopefully someday will decide the big of the earth to solve the Cyprus problem in order to cease existing green lines and points. In Europe there should be free movement in all points.,Ledras
30,"Interesting border crossing, you need to carry your passport but no visa is required. while crossing to the North (Turkish Cypriot) side, I suggest change some currency to Turkish Lira, though they accept euros but more often they will charge more in euros.",Ledras
50,I had never visited Nicosia before this June and obviously the border crossing was on the to do list.Just remember you must have your passports with you when you go and you have to get a 'visa' stamped on entry and re-stamped on going back.Yes it is a border crossing you can change money on the North side if you so wish but all the places/shops we visited took Euro's so not really necessary. The difference in the building from South to North was remarkable and I felt well worth the visitDownside Really hot 32 deg+ and although I had a hat etc the wait at the crossing office was about 20 minutes in the full sun so bit uncomfortable at this time of year.,Ledras
30,"I've just been through the crossing from Ledra Street. A border crossing is one that separates two countries. The whole of Cyprus is the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus, in its entirety, is a full EU member. This is why you are not stamped out and in from the southern checkpoint as, legally, you are not leaving nor re-entering Cyprus. Up to the north checkpoint, the so-called and completely unrecognised (bar Turkey) Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus like to stamp you in and out as they pretend that you are entering and leaving a new country. The northern area of Cyprus is an illegally occupied territory by the Turkish military and it's claim as an independent territory is not recognised by one single country in the whole world, except for Turkey.Make sure you take enough water and food for your visit and do not buy any 'bargains' and then you'll be morally clear that you are not funding an illegal regime. Enjoy the experience and hope that, one day, the true Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities can, one day, be reunited and live in peace with one another as they did for hundreds of years, before political intervention by the British, one of the final and very sad legacies of the old empire's 'rule and divide' imperialism.",Ledras
50,Passing the border between South nicosia and North nicosia was fast and easy: turkish officers just want you to show your passport and they give you a piece of paper with a stamp on it. You are advised to keep it carefully because you will need it when you pass the border back.,Ledras
30,"The border crossing was precise and straight forward. No hassles, no problems, just get your passport out, have them stamp a piece of paper, and you are on your way. Big contrast between the 'Turkish' side and the 'Greek' side, but no more so that when traveling between the two countries. Don't try to judge the northern side of Cyprus from this border crossing as you will be wrong. We found the border agents to be professional and precise - not necessarily friendly or pleasant - but they don't get paid to have personalities. Enjoy a great stroll through the northern portion of the walled city, sample some great Turkish food and drink some wonderful Turkish tea.",Ledras
50,"yesterday a was in nicosia.At the first view is a nice town , with nice shops.There i found MacDonalds, KFC, Debenhams etc .Take care when you cross the turkish border.They give you the visa , take care about that visa don't lose.If you lose you can't enter back in the european part of Nicosia.",Ledras
40,"This time in Cyprus I was staying in the north, near Kyrenia (Girne) and entered the walled part of Lefkosa. I walked through into Nicosia and suddenly found 'Europe'! MacDonalds, KFC, Debenhams etcI didn't try to take any 'fake' goods though, having seen a sign about them being confiscated.No sign of UN troops when I crossed, but signs on the gates to the forbidden zone.Passport stamped in both directions.",Ledras
50,"OK, guys, this is a border crossing. If you expect any excitement, you'll be disappointed. This is a good thing: while various governments continue to make total fools of themselves, the mayors of the two halves of Nicosia are working to make the best of a bad situation and keep future options open. And thus this crossing is a low-key affair. On the Greek side you'll see a piece of contemporary art that illustrates the Greek opinion on the Turks' concern for human rights. I'm pretty sure that the Turks don't agree...",Ledras
40,After a relaxing walk and a delicious coffee on the Ledra street the cross point separating the city of Nicosia creates you an upset and so many thoughts about a city that still remains divided!!!,Ledras
20,"If you don't know what is in story for you, this can be frightening. We took a taxi (probably a family car w/ a portable =taksi= sign stuck on the roof) from the Turkish airport to the Cypriot side of the island where we had hotel reservations. Our cab driver streaked down the main thoroughfare, on the =wrong= side of the boulevard (Brits controlled the island for awhile sometime back) and he then snaked through narrow streets, unloaded us and pointed to the way we should go. We had to show ID to the first set of border patrol guards. We think they were Turkish. Then we showed our documents to the second set of guards, who riffled through my suitcase only. We then, Sunday night, in the dark, after nine pm, hauled our wobbling suitcases clattering over the pavers through the middle of Ledra street promenade. Everything was closed-- we didn't realize that the next day was a holiday-- and young men huddled together on street corners. We kept walking and walking and eventually spied a homemade =TAKSI= sign. We said, Yes, to the taximan. Paid our 10 Euros and got dropped off at our hotel, a mere 5 minutes outside of the city walls. If you know that you will be riding through the village, if you know that you will have more than one set of officers to clear you, if you know that it is a bit of a hike uphill over the pavers through the shop/restaurant section, if you know that you will find taxis on the other side, then it might not be so scary!",Ledras
50,"Crossing this border is an extraordinary experience. As you walk across the 'green line' you see an Australian policeman with an Italian policeman guarding the narrow strip that forms the line. What for? The desire to break into that line and look at the streets frozen in time is enormous. You ask yourself ' how can I do this and get away with it. Perhaps I will find the legendary Ford garage and drive away the 1974 Capri'.Of course this is a nonsense... you cannot go here. This is a monument to the unbelievable stupidity of mankind. To the north the Turkish Nicossians ,(for the Turkish ;Lefkosians) live in relative poverty and to the south the Greek Nicossians live in a, well until recently, great wealth. The adherence to the Euro has all but destroyed Southern Cyprus. We have many examples of the complete failure of politics in our world but this is truly a wonderful example.",Ledras
30,"On our holiday to Cyprus we visited Nicosia. Of course we visited the border crossing . It is a little weird to be looking down a street . Be on the Cypriot southern run side and see the Turkish flag flying some 100 meters farther down the street. Then to see U.N. troops patrolling the no man's land.Made me feel a little sad realising this lovely island still has a lot of problems.Still my wife had a great time shopping . Some good bargains to be had. Remember and haggle......Oh and go up to the observatory.What a view, it is on top of Debenhams ..",Ledras
10,"If you hold a non European and passport from first world countries , be prepared for a very bad experience.If your port of entry is north cyprus ..even if you hold a schengen visa/ European resident permit - you will be denied entry by Greek cyprus authorities. They will be rude and even threaten to get you arrested. No problems for European or first world passport holders. Very bad experience with the police..ruined our vacation.",Ledras
50,"Walking across is very straight-forward; fill in a visa form, show your passport and have the visa stamped. Make sure you get the visa stamped again on the way back.Nicosia on the other side is like going back 30 years. The market place has been renovated and is lovely. There are plenty of small restaurants serving great food. Makes a lovely trip.",Ledras
30,"This crossing point gives tourists the opportunity to easily cross and see both sides of Nicosia / Lefkosia, but remember ""Tourists"" being the phrase. The people you speak to at the crossings, whether Greek or Turkish know your a tourist and are more than willing to tell their biased side of the history. Too many people write on this review after visiting this crossing about how poor the Turkish side is and how wrong the Turkish were in stealing the Greek property......Learn your history before commenting.........Turkish Cypriots also lost property and the invasion was in response to a Greek Coup, it was defence, the Greek are'nt all innocent either. Dont take this crossing as being what the TRNC is like, venture further into the Turkish side and you will see it is the beautiful Mediterranean of times past, relaxed pace of life and unspoilt, not like the modern fast paced life of the South, that is the beauty of Cyprus, the best of both worlds, if you get the chance to cross with a car and venture into the true North, take the opportunity, its worth it...........and finally remember, its the Greek Cypriots that keep voting AGAINST unification not the Turkish. I'm an ex british soldier that has served in the south and have chosen to purchase a holiday home in the North, so i've experienced both sides and versions.......visit this place to enjoy the people and the experiences and create your own impressions, Greek or Turkish, they are actually all very nice friendly people.",Ledras
40,An interesting process going from Southern Nicosia into the North. Be patient as queues can get long and slow! Important points: You will need your passport. Get the paper stamped NOT your passport or you will have problems returning. Do NOT buy the fake designer goods - tempting as they are the Customs officers will take them off you on your return into Southern Cyprus.,Ledras
40,"This is a journey on foot, crossing the only divided city in the world. You need your passport and your details are recorded at the border control and they give you the visa to cross on a separate piece of paper which you can keep on your return as a souvenir. We crossed over without any hassle. Photography at the crossing is not permitted by the Turkish police as they are sensitive to you photographing the bullet holes in the buildings due to the invasion in 1974. It is a bit of a culture shock once in the Turkish quarter. Poverty is obvious and be aware that most of the clothing etc. is fake. On offer is every designer brand known to man but ask yourself ""is it genuine at that price"" A piece of history not to miss out on.",Ledras
40,This is the most practical crossing as the others you need a car or the Ledra Palace Hotel crossing is a little far from the shops and places to visit. This is a very unfortunate situation whereby it is the only divided country and city in Europe. Created by the coup and invasion to oust Arc. Makarios by Greece and so on... It is definately worth seeing both sides. The crossing and police immigration is not complicated.,Ledras
10,"I have never met a more rude and racist bunch of police ""officers"". Travelling frNorth to south with an iranian friend of mine, he needed a visa (which we didnt know about) to enter south cyprus. All they needed to do was tell us so. Instead they threatened to arrest him, they shouted as us as if we were animals and made us feel small looking down on us because i am half cypriot and he iranian. After 20minutes of being drilled and misspoken to they let us go back to north cy with several warnings. But they were so rude and so racist i will never forget this terrible expirience. Ive travelled to 34 countries in my life- have mot expirienced worst police attitudes in my life!",Ledras
40,"Interesting walk.Many lovely shops on the Turkish Cypriot side's narrow streeets leading to the border crossing selling goods at very competitive prices.Old buildings in buffer zone worth a glance as you walk along.On greek side,street modernised with bigger shops.Shop fronts look more modern too in this part of Ledra street.Goods seem to be more expensive than on the Turkish Cypriot side.Well worth a visit to compare both sides of this divided city.",Ledras
40,"After leaving the Greek-Cypriotic part, you'll enter a buffer zone, where houses are empty, brickwork in windows and UN soldiers.After 50 m, you'll arrive at the Turkish Police Station (immigration).A white form with your name, passport no. etc., will be stamped and you can enter the Turkish part of Nicosia (or as the |Greeks say, the occupied part).Returning to the Greek part, means that the Turkish Police will stamp your white form again and you'll have to show your passport at the Greek-Cypriotic immigration.The border crossing is for pedestrians only, there are no costs involved.",Ledras
30,"I stayed in the Greek side and wanted to visit the Turkish side to say I've done it. It's mostly just shop after shop of designer knock-offs but I enjoyed seeing the sights as well (St. Sophia's). I was on foot, so couldn't go too far. But if you're on Ledras, might as well cross over! Don't get your passport stamped though; give them one of the slips of paper they have at the desk. A passport stamp will create all kinds of trouble when you go through customs in other countries bc the Turkish side is not recognized and considered an occupier (depends who you talk to).",Ledras
40,"If the Ledra Street border crossing was not originally on your list of things to do in Nicosia, you should definitely do the walk to better understand the history of the island the impact the invasion had. On the Turkish side, witness the somber atmosphere and abandoned buildings. As soon as you cross over to the Greek side, which takes all of 45 seconds, the ambiance changes and you are once again in Europe with the regular commercialism and Starbucks.If you are coming from the Turkey side, and you entered the country via the Turkish side through Ercan, the border patrol will stamp your passport, while the Greek side will not give any stamps. If you are coming from the Greek side to the Turkish side, you will have to fill out a short form which gets stamped, and you will not get a stamp in your passport.This is definitely a must-do as Nicosia is the only divided city in the entire world!",Ledras
40,"Must take opportunity to cross from south to north of Ledra Street. Ledra Street is a pedestrian walking street lined with high-street fashion brands. At the border crossing, please have passport ready and also to fill in a simple immigration form. Checkpoint officers on both sides are NOT intimidating.Along Ledra Street, do visit the Debenhams Department store - the 11th floor has a spectacular view of the town. Only 2 euros to enter plus they provide a pair of binoculars too!",Ledras
40,"Yes, welcome in the checkpoint of the last divided city in Europe. Don´t forget your passport if don´t wanna miss the turkish side, full of life and much more friendly than the greek side.",Ledras
30,"Nice to see the North and the Arch bishops palace was worth the trip.Saw two cars given to him by President Kennedy Then the Turkish Bazaar etc.Also included are the church with all gold interior and a mosque.On our trip we had a few hours to look around the lovely clean shopping centre on the South side of the border ,before a nice meal in a local restaurant with local food and wine.When we finished our meal we had a visit to a museum whih had some old and modern Cypriot and Turkish artifactsAll in all enjoyed the trip ,although when we visit again will stay this side of the border and shop.",Ledras
50,"Having read about the division/occupation of Cyprus prior to my visit I was, like many other visitors, curious to see the greenline when I visited Nicosia. My first sight of it came as somewhat of a suprise. Whilst walking along a street I turned a corner to be confronted by barriers across a street between 2 buildings. Unlike the Berlin Wall it was made up of oil drums, barbed wire with a wooden observation post with a soldier in looking back at me. Behind which the old abandonded buildings could be seen. This made for a very strange and somewhat depressing sight. There were signs informing people that photography was prohibited. They were not really needed as it is not a place one would feel at easy lingering around too long. The official crossing point at Ledra Street was an other strange experiance. Ledra Street is a busy thriving shopping street which could be anywhere in Western Europe. At the north end of the street this changes. Passing through Greek-Cypriot check point pedestrians walk around 100m past empty (although recently painted and maintained) shops in the bufferzone. In gaps between these buildings the old abadonded streets can be glimpsed. At the Turkish-Cypriot check point visitors are issued with a paper visa and allowed to continue on. After passing the check point things could not be more different. Despite only walking a short distance along the same street it feels like a different world. The buildings are much older and shops smaller. It did not feel as comfortable or safe as the South. Groups of men hanging around added to this sense of slight intimidation. Some of the shops here appeared to specialise in forged foreign designer label clothes. There were warnings on the South check point that to bring such items back was prohibited. I found crossing from one side to the other a very strange and interesting experiance. For me it brought a very small part of the history I had read on Cyprus to life. I would recommend anyone with an interest in history or politics to make this journey - it was an eyeopener.Although I have rated this 5 stars as it is not a tourist visitor attraction it is the living history of an on going conflict. For that reason it is worthy of visiting.",Ledras
30,If you are staying in this part of the island this pedestrian crossing is the best way to get a taste of the North of the island.,Ledras
50,"Very nice street in Old town in Nicosia which is full of coffee shops, where you can also smoke Shisha, full of shops etc. At the end of the street you can (if you have a passport) cross the board and visit Turkish occupied zone, where you can find also various shops (cheaper than in Greek side), coffee shops and also mosque which was especially for me very interesting.",Ledras
40,It is a must when you visit Nicosia to cross the border into the Turkish occupied part of the city. You are immediately struck by the difference from the southern part of the city in so far the place is very run down..The narrow streets are lined with stalls all selling varios gifts and clothes.The only negative is the fact that the border officials on both sides of the crossing are very unfriendly,Ledras
10,"Be warned as the border guards will not tell you nor are their any signs. You cannot bring cigarettes over from the Turkish side as they will be impounded + you can be fined though this is unlikely. This is not a normal border crossing but a check point as the Turks are an occupying force, normal rules do not apply. Nicosia is therefore a complete waste of time, certainly not worthy of a visit on its own. Why there are no signs is beyond me unless the border guards are onto a good thing. Fake goods I can understand but the legitimate purchase of tobacco, where's the problem.",Ledras
20,"It's easy to wander down Ledra Street, window shopping in a fairly average town centre pedestrianised street. And then suddenly you notice the Greek-Cypriot checkpoint box. It looks marginally like the ones I used to see at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin. Of course the Greek Cypriot police are not interested in you. Wander down along the vacant street and you reach the Greek-Turkish checkpoint. A soldier in a blue beret wanders past. At this point you have to stop and think: continue into those parts of Nicosia now administered by the Turkish-Cypriots with Turkish subsidy and army support or turn around and return to Greek-Cypriot Cyprus? Legally the whole island is in the EU. In practice only Turkey recognises the occupied areas administration: the rest of the world ignores it. Take your choice. Wander along the Green Line in either direction. Oildrums, concrete slabs form the barrier. Watchtowers and bored police and army personel ignore you as you take a photo of the "" No photographs"" signs. A cheap Berlin Wall but with the same message: we can't find ways to live together even in Europe in the 21st century.Its now 38 years since the Greek coup and attempt to merge Cyprus with Greece prompted the Turkish invasion and division. Will the barriers come down? will the ""Buffer Zone under UN control be rebuilt? Or does it really suit both sides to accept the division in reality if not in shouting because to sit down to find the eventual compromise is just that little bit too much. If you are in Nicosia go to the Ledra Street crossing; visit the ""temporary"" barriers across streets; notice the run down, decrepit buildings close to the ""wall"" imagine it in your own home town and neighbourhood and think a while.",Ledras
20,"This is of course not a tourist site, quite the contrary. It is an international conflict made visible. Ledra is a shopping street without particular charm, but it has become a symbol for the division of Cyprus, because it is cut off at a certain point. For many years, it was a dead end street in the middle of the city, nowadays people can walk over to the Turkish side (or ""the territory not under the effective control of the government of the republic of Cyprus"" as the Greek speaking community in the South would call it). The frontier post is far from being spectacular, a small cabin at the corner. It looks very much like a provisional installation. As such, it subtly reinforces the impression that cutting a town into two halfs is not a sustainable solution. Sooner or later the frontier will fall again, but currently nobody knows how to get there.",Ledras
40,"On the Cypriot side, everyone is more relaxed, and there's a genuine feeling of freedom. On the Turkish side, while there's some interesting shopping, I felt an undercurrent of fear. It's like on the surface everything is nice ans shiny, but in the background there's a menace about. I suppose the stern looking Turkish officials, and red warning sites about all things forbidden make it feel less ""free"".",Ledras
40,"If you're staying in the Greek south Cyprus and visit Lefkosia you'll want to visit the Turkish north - unless your political views are such that you wouldn't countenance such a thing. The border crossing is pretty straight forward - you'll need a passport, obviously, and there is some paperwork to be done for the Turkish authorities. If you are only going to be there for a few hours you need not change any currency - euros are acceptable.",Ledras
40,Old Nicosia is a fascinating place to vist. Within the walls that surround the old city. Nicosia is the last divied capital city in the world. The ceasefire line runs right through the old city and you can walk right upto it. Most of the Greek Cypriot national service soldiers dont mind you taking photos at the check points and barricades. They are happy to speak to tourists. Ledra street was known as `Murder Mile` during the independence struggle against the British in the 1950s. Also worth a vist is Nicosia central prison which has a small museum where you can still see the gallows that the British executed young Cypriot fighters (phone for appointment and opening times). There are many attactions just off Ledra steet. The street itself is Cyprus`s premier shopping steet full over overpriced fancy shps. But still a good place for an evening stroll. You have to produce your passport if you want to cross over to the Turkish occupied north.,Ledras
50,"Lidras street crossing point is the place in the end of Ledras pedestrian steet in Nicosia where you can cross from the north to the south and opposite. When you visit this place you will have a first eye look to the 36+year dragety of cyprus form the turkish occupation. Its not like the Berlin wall but the feeling is the same. Pictures of the refugies stands with fliers and on the other side nearly an other world of shops this is how Nicosia ended after the Turkish invation.... Dispite all these You have many things to see and do there and I mean throuout Ledras street Onasagorou str Faneromenis squere places... There are many shops, cafes and restaurants as well as bars. At nights in these neiberhouds you will have a boho feeling so dont dress like going out for a formal dinner with high heels.... you will find it unbearable in the pedestrians",Ledras
10,"A big note that this is Ledra's street crossing point. It is NOT a border. Boarders divide countries. Cyprus is country on its whole, with its northern part being occupied by the Turkish troops since 1974 when Turkey invated to Cyprus.",Ledras
30,Ledras is a nice place to go for walking downtown full of stores coffee shops and plenty of places for food.,Ledras
40,The crossing is easy and painless. Nicosia is the last divided capital in the world. The experience is a must if you are visiting Nicosia.,Ledras
50,Make sure you have your passport with you as the North Cypriots will have to see it.They will ask you if you want your passport stamped or a piece of paper (I believe Greece & Cyprus will refuse you entry if they see the North Cyprus stamp in your passport).You will have to fill in a simple piece of paper.Thats it.Enjoy the north!,Ledras
20,"We did cross the border and nothing was wrong with anyone that worked at it , just a sad situation. Make sure to have your passport and I wouldn't suggest crossing by yourself. We didn't stay too long there wasn't much that would keep you on the Turkish side now. They are just wishing that people will buy their merchandise and have coffee , to be honest we just wanted back on the Cypriot side. We went so we could say we did it. Plus side the guys working the Cypriot side were cute.",Ledras
30,"A bit disorganized but very quick indeed.A bit disorganized because there was no clear line to queue and there was no one to ask about the piece of paper I had to fill in so I had to stand in line, ask for the paper, get out of the line, fill the paper in and get back in line.You just need to fill in a piece of paper, hand it over to the officer and he/she will stamp it in no time. No question asked.",Ledras
40,I went here several years ago and was amazed by the lookout post and the deserted street on the Turkish side of the street. It was so sad and almost ghostly. My son and returned recently and whow(!) has it changed. With your passort you can now pop over the border easily and the Turkish side is now full of tourist gift shops and the older deserted area seems to have vanished.It is a very strange experience if you have been there previously!,Ledras
30,"This is not a really nice place to visit. It has too many ghosts of conflicts and war, still going on with the Turkish occupied zone still with Turkish army. No doubt both sides have tales of horror but I think this is not a nice place to visit. I crossed to have a look at the Turkish occupied zone but was very pleased to get back after an hour or so wondering about. The ""other"" side looks in bad repair and not very nice, and the shops look as if they are in need of restoration to retain the older historic interest.I definitely do not rate this as an ""attraction""",Ledras
50,"I would say this is the one of the best place in Nicosia spl at late hours, full of pubs n joints... cool n happening... nice outlets and cafe on the streets, if u go inside small lanes, u can find good small shops to shop around ... good items with economical price....Overall a very nice place...",Ledras
50,"I had always heard how hard it was to cross the border from Greek Nicosia into Turkish Nicosia. Things have changed and the border crossing crossing could not have been easier. It is a matter of showing your passport to the Turkish passport control and filling out a very short form with your name, passport number and nationality. They stamp the form and you are on your way. When crossing back into South Nicosia, show your passport and the stamped paper to the Turkish authorities and they stamp the paper again. The Greek authorities pretty much wave you back in. I was able to use that same passport form on both visiits.",Ledras
30,It is ok! It was a little wird for me that I am greek. As you pass from the one side to the occupied There are posters of complaints as it is the only town still divided in two!!! Check it out!,Ledras
40,"I don`t really know if I would call this an attraction. For the locals I guess it`s a place of conflict, for the tourists a place of interest.It`s easy enough to cross the border, and it cost no money. Just make sure that your passport is not stamped, but a piece of VISA paper. This will ensure that you get in and out of the contries without problem.In ""the buffer zone"" between the borders, there is a whole bunch of ""hippies"" demonstrating against war and diversity between the contries. They have strong, but interesting meanings, so if you have the time to take s chat with them it`s well worth it.",Ledras
40,"It is a place of interest for visitors, as its interesting to see the contrast between the free and occupied part. For locals its a disgraceful place, as it still divides the city and the country in two",Ledras
40,"Nicosia is a very strange and different experience to the rest of south Cyprus. It has much more of a middle eastern feel and look, with windy narrow streets where your sense of direction will be tested even with a map in hand. But really that is all part of the charm to get completely lost and have no idea what is round the next corner. It was a shock and quite intimidating the first time you turn a corner and you come across the oil drum barricades and barbed wire controlled by the UN. But we felt completely safe at all timeIt was very easy to drive into Nicosia from the south and easy to park, there are lots of pay and display parking just outside the walls in the ""moat"", we paid €3 for 6 hours which was enough time to see the north and south. Once you find the border crossing (which we stumbled across by chance) it is very easy to cross. Just walk through, pass the rather charming hippy peace camp until you get to a passport booth, fill in a white slip which you will find at the front of the booth (just push in and grab one) so that your passport isn't stamped, then continue into north Nicosia. There was no fee to cross, I didn't see any time limit for coming back, and most places take Euros on the other side (2TL=€1 April 2012) all rather simple really. The north is much more dilapidated than the south and everything is in walking distance. We also went to the observatory on the 11th floor of Debenhams (through the cafe €1pp) where you can see across the whole of the city. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, if you are really into history it is probably worth having guide but we just wandered and lapped up the feeling of this unique city.",Ledras
40,very easy just with international passports - no more need for additional papers to fill in - if you want you can cross without control but no guarantee for return ...:-) - first 300 meters very touristic but friendly - a bit further rather poor neighbourhood,Ledras
30,"You need to cross this border if you head north (or south). For those of us who didn't visit Berlin or the iron curtain in the Cold War times, it is an opportunity to admire how things were supposed to be. So sad. But the crossing itself is easy, and all the interesting sites in the occupied north are within walking distance. A ""must"" if you are in Nicosia, as the monuments on the north side are the best in town",Ledras
40,"The experience of walking thru the short and narrow buffer zone street is a way to focus your attention on the sad separation of this city...to remember that from 1963 this street has been a guarded crossing, and from 1974 until April 2008, no one crossed this walled street. In the late 1950s revolutionary period, this area was known as ""murder mile"".",Ledras
50,"No problems crossing to South Cyprus. Only problem was that the information centre on the South side of the crossing was absolutely hopeless. They could not direct us to the Archeological museum just outside the Venetian walls. However, the Info. centre at the end of Ledra street was excellent.",Ledras

10,"We are living in the south part of Cyprus. Sometimes we go to the north but after what happened at our last attempt to cross the border, we will never try to do that again. My wife went there a few months ago and when she came back to the south, the authorities did some mistake and didn't put any stamp on her visa to prove she was out of the North. When we tried to pass yesterday, they said my wife still appears to be in the north (even 3 months later). They wouldn't accept the fact that they did a mistake. They were blaming my wife that she didn't give her passport for control when she got out the previous time. Also, about me, they said I have to pay a traffic fine for speeding (even though I was never there driving). So, to conclude, the staff was very rude, unwilling to understand a logical explanation and this whole experience made us hate that so called country. I strongly advise you to visit any other place but this.",Ledras

Observing the no man's land, the ruined buildings that once were housing the most vital parts of Nicosia.What used to be a tribute to the history of a nation that still stands divided and still waiting for justice, now become a crosspoint for the curious tourists who seek to visit the opposite side. For the greek cypriots this is the part of their motherland, the land of their ancestors that still stands divided.Now the ruins in both sides of the crossing are covered by colourful banners. There are no strict border formalities for EU citizens. Turkish cypriots will give you to fill in a visa document which they'll stamp at your entry. You'll handle it back to them at your exit. There will be no stamps at your passport.There is a profound contrast between the flourishing greek part of the city and the underdeveloped turkish part of Nicosia which in fact resembles more to a typical town of Eastern Anatolia.",Ledras

It's safe and the people are friendly.The staff at the Ledra Street Border Crossing make crossing effortless.Commentary:Its really amazing how many millions of dollars the UN spends supporting this divided country.A few years ago the border got a lot easier to cross. That's partly what inspired my visit. Its technically illegal to spend money at a merchant In N Cyprus if that merchant occupies a space formerly owned by a Greek Cypriot. The thing, back in the 70s when Turkey invaded, they chased off the Greek Cypriots. The Greeks moved into refugee camps along the border, to the South. Turkey then imported people from around Turkey to occupy the north. Today many formerly Greek-owned businesses are still occupied by Turks. The Greek Cypriots consider everything on the Turkish side ""stolen.""The capital, Nicosia, is now the last remaining divided capital on earth. There's a militarized line right down the middle--just like East and West Berlin used to be.Sitting in a Starbucks on the main street in Nicosia was a great opportunity to learn more about North Nicosia. At Starbucks a local explained his family ran from the north during the invasion, and never returned. Thirty-nine years ago they left a four-bedroom, two-car-garage house on a residential street. They even left a dog in the back yard. The house was full of their food, books, pictures, dirty cloths, etc. They had no idea that they'd never be returning.The guy's mom went back about 10 years ago (when the border opened) to see her old house and shop. She found a family living in her house and another family running her shop. He said there was a different dog in the yard. The guy sitting here with me is 38 years old.

It was well worth the effort.We found a the bus stop at the Larnaca beach front from where a green bus took us to Nicosia in less than an hour. It was hard to find the border crossing when we arrived in Nicosia (also called Lefkosia) because there where no signs pointing to it. But if you find Ledra street in the old part of the town, then just follow it and you will find the crossing. It's kind of like traveling to Cuba or similar places: they won't stamp your passport. You'll have to fill in some kind of a visa paper instead that's going to be stamped again when you come back. You can keep it as a souvenir in the end. The Turkish part of the old town is nice too, plus you can treat yourself to some Efes Pilsen beer and local kebap etc.And by the way, it's the only divided capital in the world that's left. Once Cyprus will re-unite, it's gone. So be quick!",Ledras

But got to the border, hardly any signs up, if you go the wrong way or you don't stop and keep walking they just yell at ya to go where-ever - so its all good!! Everyone is so serious....... we didn't stray too far away from the border in case we got lost as we went quite late in the day but stayed long enough to hear the call to prayer, everything is very cheap here! I got some great bracelets and key rings for gifts and an awesome looking bag AND the shop keepers were alot friendlier than their counterparts. They take euro, they have a price for lira or a price for euro. If you get to Nicosia - you gotta do it. Good luck!!",Ledras

50,"Well worth taking a walk down Ledra Street and crossing into the Turkish part of Cyprus. When you walk down Ledra Street the crossing is rather unremarkable, actually we walked down the first time at night and was unaware that we where in the UN buffer zone. Don't expect armed guards or anything out of ""Hogans Hero's""! You just need to take your passport. My fiancée and I had no problems getting in, her with a Russian passport and myself with an Australian one. There is plenty of shopping to do on both sides of the border. On the Turkish side it is very cheap and picked up some nice pottery and scarfs for presents and real Turkish delight! When on the Turkish side you can change money to Lira, although most shops accept Euro's, some accept GBP and USD",Ledras
