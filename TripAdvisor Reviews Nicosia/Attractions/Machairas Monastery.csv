50,"It is such a beautiful place – must visit!We have visited this sanctuary in the past, but every time I am overwhelmed with its spirituality and its mysticism. The (monk) monastery is very well preserved and its exterior is magnificent, the gardens are so beautiful – too bad no pictures are allowed. Inside the church one feels truly inspired, beyond words. At the church entrance there is a small lobby where you can light a candle (just throw a few coins for each candle, less than half a euro). In addition, if someone you know is ill, you may write their names on a small piece of paper and submit it in a special wooden box (at the left of the church entrance).TIP 1: There are very strict regulations regarding apparel. There is no entrance fee but they are very strict with how people are dressed. No shorts or short skirts, no sleeveless or strap t-shirts, and I think no sandals. If a visitor is seen as improperly dressed, they will ask him/her to put on a robe. So if you don’t like that, take something of your own to cover yourself.TIP 2: Even in the summer, the breeze might be a bit too cool for some people, so you are advised to take a shawl with you – in any case!Tip 3: At the gate you will see the small shop selling icons and other religious items, but also home-made products like olive oil, honey and almond desert, as well as herbs grown in the area. Prices are reasonable and the products are of excellent quality.",Machairas Monastery

50,"Located on one of the Troodos mountain peaks is Macheras Monastery, one of the most famous in Cyprus. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and we were amazed by many of the old icons found here.Outside we saw a big statue of Gregorios Afxentiou one of EOKA's freedom fighters who single handily fought valiantly against the British.The bigger than life statue sits majestically on the cliff overlooking the valley below where he stayed in a narrow cave in which he was eventually burned alive after the British troops found out his hideout.Our visit brought chills to our bonesBoth from our tour of the miraculous monastery and our admiration of Afxentiou's courage and honor to his country.",Machairas Monastery
