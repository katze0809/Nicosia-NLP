40,"Great collection of paintings and artifacts from the Leventis family, a famous Cypriot trading family - mainly Africa.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This is a relatively new gallery of one man's collection of paintings in 3 categories, Cypriot, Greek and International (mainly French and Italian). Many of the names you know are there eg Monet, Renoir, El Greco, Canaletto, Chagal, Pissaro, Sisley etc. Recently a new gallery of gold coins from antiquity to modern times has been added.The paintings were well laid out and the place is air conditioned.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,First time that I have been extremely impressed with the write up but much less so with the collection itself. Found only a few of the paintings to be outstanding work by the artists or particularly moving: the Cypriot section being a notable exception. The descriptive material was informative and easily understandable. Building itself is beautiful- but relatively small exhibit space. 5 euro ( 4 for seniors ) admission admission seemed excessive,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Very new museum, artefacts range from Medieval to impressionism, from France to Greece. An interesting and quiet oasis in the middle of the noisy town.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Ecellent vernisage of belgian Painters, with many i did not know before. Great quality of event, with interesting lectures from organizers.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Its a beautiful modern building where the 3 first floors are full of paintings from cypriots,greek,french,italians and many more painters.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"Right in the centre of modern Nicosia, the aim of the gallery is to highlight the work of Cypriot artists, which it does well. The paintings help to illustrate the history of Cyprus and do so much better than some of the politically -charged History books that are available in the shops. There is a tendency to over-glorify the founder, but if one ignores that then you will learn and enjoy much from this visit",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"not only the newest galery / museum in town but also one of the best coffee/restaurants in Nicosia. the staff is very helpful, the food we tried (the burger, rocket salad ) were all too delicious",A G Leventis Gallery

50,"in the heart of the city where u can enjoy renounced local and foreign artists,my absolute favorite painting of Diamantis The world of Cyprus is a reminder of the life in Cyprus back in the old days and the smaller version across depicts the shock and devastation after the invasion of Turkeytheir bar/restaurant is quite nice and a nice place to recollect after the visit",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A really beautiful place, very well thought and organised! The architecture surprises you! You walk through an old door to a very modern design ready to display various exhibitions! Worth a visit !",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"We really enjoyed the Cypriot collection and were keen to view. The Greek art too was very interesting. The Leventi also has a European collection of art with many impressionist paintingsThe gallery is a beautiful modern space down town. We had a coffee but would love to had dinner in their restaurant But night it was not open todayThe location is down town and easy to get to, we walked from our hotel.We also visited the Leventi museum a 5 min walk away in the old town",A G Leventis Gallery
50,Visited the gallery on recommendation by a local friend. Worth the three hours I spent there. The collection is varied with paintings from different periods. On exhibit is also a collection of period pieces of porcelain.,A G Leventis Gallery

50,Greek contemporary art collection on the top floor. Superb french impressionist paintings on the first floor and a mixed old master's collection of great quality. Cypriot art and elegant cafe on the ground floor. The museum is only 5 years old and features the art collection of A:G. Leventis.

30,"Nice atmosphere, clean, not crowded, friendly and helpful staff, food average, free underground parking.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,The special show right now features gold coins and is fascinating. But the whole collection is very interesting. And the building is very impressive. Worth the visit if you are interested in Cypriot and Greek art.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"We went to the restaurant in the building a couple of weeks ago to eat lunch and didn’t realize it was part of the gallery so we went back another day to visit. It is exceptional. They have theee levels which include Cypriot art, a private collection and Greek art. I especially liked the Cypriot art rooms because I didn’t know much about it beforehand. I would strongly advise getting the audio guide because it includes a lot of useful background information. There was also a special exhibit of gold coins which were a lot more interesting than I thought they would be. They also have workshops and educational programs for children.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The gallery is situated in a contemporary building featuring stylish decor with a luxurious touch. It houses interesting permanent collections and temporary thematic exhibitions. The organisers show great care for their audience by running special occasions, such as lectures, exhibition inaugurations, etc. The souvenir shop is worth visiting as there are some nice unusual items sold there.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This is a must-visit for anyone visiting Nicosia, especially since its collection of artwork in unrivaled in the capital city (and in the whole of Cyprus). A beacon of culture since it opened. The cafe/restaurant in it is also recommended",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A beautiful gallery with many famous paintings but also a glimpse of how Cyprus art evolved. Well worth a visit. Also worth a visit is their coffee shop/restuarant. Ordered two cappuchino coffees, nice and strong, but a nice surprise - they both came with complimentary chocolate mousses, very nice.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,A more fresh approach to exhibiting art that what Cyprus was used to so far. A notable Gallery showing events and artists unprecedented by past exhibitions.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,an unexpected find in Nicosia. Many beautiful french impressionist paintings. and an exhibition dedicated to adamantios diamantis that also had el Greco and Marc Chagall. totally worth the visit!,A G Leventis Gallery

40,"we visited this galery with my family. you have the chance to know Cypriot artists. you can also see paintings from famous european painters, and a great collection of the personal belongings Leventis.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The museum is a shining example of what one man can accomplish. Much like the Lobkowicz museum offering in Prague, the art is noteworthy and allows one to embellish themselves in the national art. Cypriot art is refreshing and symbolic of these wonderful people. A nice gift shop and cafe solidifies a wonderful time at a fair price. So, when you need refuge from the heat, walk to the end of Ledrus turn right and it is just across the bus station. A real value while visiting Picasso, Renoir, and Chagall. Leventis was a true philanthropic man.",A G Leventis Gallery
30,Great place to stop if you are nearby visiting the Cyprus museum. Modern Cypriot art in several themed exhibits. Not sure why there is a French area and a Greek area.,A G Leventis Gallery
40,Would have chosen a different gallery but it was closed on a Monday so visited this one. Interesting exhibition with Henry Moore overtones. Good for a couple of hours.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A place of selective character,quality of its kind as its was the inspiration of the founder LEVENTIS.There are 3 floors and On each floor you will find its own theme of collection with unique and very valuable pieces.",A G Leventis Gallery

50,"The building is very elegant, the rooms and light allow a tranquil visit. The temporary exhibitions can be fascinating.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"What a great art gallery boasting art by Renoir, Pissarro, El Greco, Monet and others. A wonderful collection for a small island! Well worth a visit if you are in Cyprus, housed in a modern new building. A lovely cafe on the ground floor.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"Visited in September and were the only people in the gallery. It meant we had a guard each as we walked around - they were very attentive!! Good selection across 3 floors, Cypriot art is worth seeing as it is not often you see it. Lovely building also.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The building is nice, visitor friendly and elegant. The collections are amazing, really improbable for the size of the island. Alongside many world class master like Manet, Chagal et al you find the most amazing presentation of Cypriot artists crowned with the magnificent ""World of Cyprus"" at Ground floor. A magical afternoon spent there. Not to be missed.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,I spent a quiet morning browsing the gallery. It is well lit but my only criticism was that there were no benches. Sometimes I like to sit and just study the art. The staff were helpful and it wasnt crowded at all.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"place filled with culture and history , several events take place like presentations and awards, nice decor, nice catering",A G Leventis Gallery
50,The Leventis Gallery is a must see for every art lover visiting Nicosia. Expect to spend 2-3 hours inside the gallery.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This is a gallery I would like to visit again. It is home to over 800 paintings, many by famous painters, including El Greco, and the whole layout is excellent. Do not miss the monumental painting ""The World of Cyprus"" by Adamantios Diamantis, nor the wood-panelled room, from the collector's apartment, which was transported and re-erected in the Gallery.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A rather recently built museum, beautiful painting of Cypriot and Greek artists.One of the best museums in town!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"If you are in Nicosia and an art lover, you MUST visit this place. The entrance fee is ok, for the art selection you are seeing.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"We visited on a very hot day, July23rd and it was very quiet. There is some work going on a the front of the building and the cafe is closed. There is also no temporary exhibition at the moment but there is an exhibition of Cypriot painters such as Adamantis Diamantis whose 'The World Of Cyprus' is shown here. A very long piece of art depicting life in a Cypriot village.The other artists and paintings are all very interesting.On the first floor is the Paris collection, mostly European art gathered by Leventis himself which wasn't as interesting to us.However,on the second floor there is an exhibition by Greek artists which again was very interesting.So, a mixed bag for us but overall, very good.",A G Leventis Gallery
20,I was the only person in the gallery and was followed around non stop by the security which made it difficult to enjoy the art. I know art is very subjective but I was expecting more Cypriot works rather than the usual French paintings I could see anywhere. On the other hand the building alone is worth 5euros to look around.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,A.G. Leventis Gallery is located within walking distance from the center of Nicosia. There is a always an exhibition running and the gallery provides a café as well.There are guided tours for people interested finding out more.,A G Leventis Gallery
40,"I had a couple of hours to spare on one of our days in Nicosia, and so I visited this attractively designed gallery with a broad collection of Cypriot work and a more modest but good collection of European works. Various leaflets and an audio guide are available to inform your visit. There is also a small exhibition on the Leventis family who founded the gallery. Having a modest rather than a strong interest in art, I mainly focussed upon the Cypriot works that were new to me. If you have strong interest in art you would regard the gallery as a little gem. An enjoyable visit.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"This is a beautifully arranged art gallery in architecturally nicely designed modern building, hosting the rich collection of A.G. Leventis. It is divided into Cypriot, Greek and European art galleries with paintings and other decorative art pieces. It provides a very representative view especially of Cypriot and Greek painting in the last 2 centuries, and you can walk through the exhibits in a couple of hours. Very educational also for children. Ask for their workshops for children.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"I believe it is the best collection of Cypriot artists in Cyprus. Nice and easy to visit if you have 2-3 of hours to spare in Nicosia. The original Adamantios Diamantis work of art that describes in detail how Cyprus was 40-50 years ago is found in the ground floor. There is a nice cafeteria in the ground floor,",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"If you're into art, then this is a little gem to visit while in Nicosia.It is an art gallery with European and Cypriot paintings and artefacts, mainly exquisite porcelain (not my taste, but I see the value...). It is a purpose-built museum, which doesn't take long to see. Also a good way to get out of the summer heat or winter rain!Before visiting check to see if they have either a special exhibition or an event there, usually presentations by experts.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A cultural, spiritual and mouth-watering experience. The first time I visited the gallery was one of the first weeks that opened and I had a blast. Some of El Greco's works were there and the most amazing paintings were the ones from Cypriot artist, depicting the life on the island 50 years ago. The second time I visited was exclusively for the restaurant. Amazing food, great service and a spectacular feeling to dine at the best gallery Cyprus has had",A G Leventis Gallery
50,If you want to have a taste of Cypriot and Greek culture you must visit this lovely Gallery! It is worth it!! It won;t take long and it will offer you a nice fresh artfull rest if you are visiting in a warm month. Rigth in the center of Nicosia ! The parking is free for visitors !,A G Leventis Gallery
40,"This museum is in old town Nicosia along the main shopping areas. It is open every day from 10am - 5pm except Tuesdays and National holidays. There is no entry fee. Levants Gallery has four floors. The top floor is dedicated mostly to an exhibit of wedding dresses, which may not interest everyone (Nicosia is a popular wedding location). The other floors have exhibits with a scattering of maps, artifacts, photos videos and other items representing the various time periods of the island's history and development. There is a small gift shop and one can either take the elevator or stairs to each floor. There is one small area with children's activities and there is an interactive video with interesting film clips and photos documenting the island's history. The Leventis Gallery would be a great place to tuck into to wait out a storm, in either really hot or really cold weather, or before/after a meal at a local restaurant.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"What an absolute pleasant surprise to find such a world class museum here in Nicosia. The private collection is stunning. The architecture, flow, and breadth of the collection are ideal for a morning tour.Currently they have a temporary exhibit of the friendship between two painters (one Greek, one English) and an English author that transports one into their magical past as they lounge about the Greek islands creating their art. Charmed lives indeed.The only thing mildly off-putting about the place is having security trail your every literal step like you're a cat burglar in waiting. But I'll pay that price to have a museum of this hidden quality mostly to myself.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"I had some friends visiting Cyprus from Heraklion ,Crete. As the wife of my dear friend Androulakis teaches art and at the same time she is a professional artistic photographer organizing very interesting exhibitions primarily in Greece The Leventis Gallery was the obvious spot to visit. We were so impressed as at that time the gallery was hosting an exhibition of two foreign artists that we could not believe that Nicosia has such a gem in the centre of the town. In short I can suggest that it is worth visiting Cyprus only for this exhibition centre to see the collections of paintings kept there. The entrance fee is five euros and for art lovers this should be a reveleation",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"We went there driven by the wish to visit the temporary exhibition about Ghikas-Fermor-Craxton, which was really worth it. A very modern gallery in a peaceful environment. Due to time limitations we did not have the opportunity to visit the permanent exhibitions, therefore we will definitely come back!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,Oh my goodness this place is idiosyncratic and eclectic but what gems of artworks are to be found.A place to return to just don't expect food to actually be on offer in the restaurant but the coffee is great.All staff were helpful. The accessible toilets were clean and spacious and on every floor. The building is cool and quiet. And the art! I could have sat in front of cypriot wall peice for a week. Massive in size and impact. It's a long drive from Paphos to Nicosia but the art made the day for me.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,a well thought and executed enterprise that brings to the Cyprus and visiting public culture of the arts of local and international artists.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,Excellent exhibits inside a modern gallery with a beautiful environment. Comfortable in studying the pieces of art. Nice café restaurant for a break.,A G Leventis Gallery

50,"It is the best gallery in Cyprus. It's a place that everyone has to visit, and enjoy all those paintings, in that beautiful building.For sure I will visit again.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"I really enjoyed the gallery, both its Greek and Cypriot collection and the Paris collection. My favourite would be Cypriot and Greek art of the 20th century, but all of the collections are lovely, presented in a modern way. Thums up for the sliding pannels that reveal more pictures after you press a button. The architecture of the building is wonderful and adds to the atmosphere. We took the audioguide which is good and comprehensive, if sometimes not a bit too much: that would be my only complaint, to maybe reduce the amount of information provided for each picture to a more bite-size information of about one minute per picture.Go by all means!",A G Leventis Gallery
40,A recently built gallery showing the actual contents of the Leventis family apartment in Paris as well as European and Cypriot paintings. Well worth a visit.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This is really good gallery in Cyprus. Comfortable space, interesting exhibitions and not bad temporary collection (they have even El Greco). Very well designed space for adults and children both. In the museum shop you can buy questbook for children so the art will be interesting for them too.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,I was privileged to visit this beautiful gallery recently.. it's the sort of place you need to go to more than once because there is just so much beauty you can fit in at one time!..the building it self is worth seeing.. state of the art spotless light and airy disabled friendly.. the restrooms are wonderful and the disabled toilet is the best equiped I've ever seen.. there is a cloak room as well with secure lockers and I spied a house wheel chair in the corner.. the 2upper levels are reached either by stairs or lift and the ground floor contains a most excellent restaurant and a very nice shop ..the main reception desk is manned by efficient and friendly staff and the galleries them selves have both electronic and human security who are also friendly knowlegable and very very observant..the 2upper floors have and auditorium and a workshop area as well as the galleries.. the ground floor houses the Cyprus collection.. a bit dark in tone for my taste but redeemed by other works that are very Cypriot. . The first floor has the French collection and has some lovely paintings and then the 2nd floor galleries have really wonderful Greek works..... the large picture windows on the upper floors frame beautiful views through to the kyrenia mountains.. I would have loved to have taken a photo but I'm sure this isn't allowedAs well as the permanent collections the gallery hosts temporary exhibitions and these are advertised on the website and in the local papers. . Don't expect to spend 1/2an hour there for a quick look. It's not that sort of place... enjoy!,A G Leventis Gallery
30,at the ground floor there is a very big painting of Diamandis cypriot painter interesting named the wold of cyprus.upstairs there are paintings of europian artists THere is one Elgreco The building is very modern and according to my oppinion not suitable for a gallery.The entrance fee is cheep but the restaurant expensive,A G Leventis Gallery
50,Something that people of Nicosia were waiting for a long time.A truly outstanding experience. Totally worth visiting!!,A G Leventis Gallery
50,Thie Gallery offers a unique opportunity to a travveler to spend some quality time exploring the arts. The gallery has a great variety of exhibits and some of the pieces there are world-class famous. A must do while in Nicosia.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,Awesome exibits and perfectly presented. Don't miss it if you visit Nicosia. The stuff is very helpful and knowledgeable.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,I loved the place from the very first moment I entered the Gallery. Very beautiful Building full of light with amazing collections from Cypriot artists and more. Excellent guides informed us on all details concerning each piece of Art. In the amphitheater of the gallery I attended a very interesting lecture about ElGreco and his art work. I ended up eating at the restaurant on site with few friends. We all loved the food and service too..,A G Leventis Gallery
40,"Its a very nice gallery to visit and learn about cypriot artist and more, but dont expect the kind of galery you can find in the big european capitals. They have a very informative and enlightening webside.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,I visited the A.G. Leventis Gallery due to a very interesting lecture about the Venetian art in Crete between the West and East. This was an excellent lecture! I congratulate the lecturer and the Gallery for giving me this opportunity to be informed about Venetian art.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This is now my favourite attraction in the whole of Cyprus. If you come expecting something to compare to the Louvre or National Gallery in London you will be disappointed. This is a purpose built gallery and it shows by how it deals with the problems of strong sunlight that you get in Cyprus.The ground floor is devoted to early Cypriot paintings that turns out to be more interesting than I expected because of the history behind it. Up to 1878 Cyprus was occupied by the Ottoman Empire and there was no art at all. Art in Cyprus started after the arrival of the British and what you see here is primitive art and how it develops rapidly as the artists learn from their contemporaries and the international movements.The second floor is devoted to European Art with examples from Monet, El Grego, Renoir, Chagall etc. The number of star paintings is relatively few but this is a great collection considering it was collected by a single man (Mr Leventis) who wanted to show his collection to the people of Cyprus.At the top floor you will find, in my opinion, the best paintings representing Greek art. This is more extensive than the other two floors and I really liked the quality and range. Many of the Greek artists represented were working in Paris and Munich and the paintings represent the styles of the periods in those countries.There is a very good audio guide for 2 euro on top of the entrance fee of 5 euro.I had a wonderful time in early December but I can imagine this will be event more attractive in the summer hot temperatures as it is perfectly air conditioned and lit.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,The museum tells the history of Nicosia. There are a lot of traditional costumes and a large collection of postcards,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Beautifully laid out, big collection of Greek and European art, all well labelled and explained. Get the audioguide, it's very helpful.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Wonderful new gallery with an excellent, well presented collection. The patron's own collection is amazing and there are some outstanding watercolour of cyprus in the nineteenth century.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,Educational approach to masterpieces focusing primarily on Greek and Cypriot paintings. The overall impression is of a high quality institution within an amazing architectural shell. The book shop and the cafeteria is a further excuse to extend your visit in a pleasant environment. I have been their in other occasions on special exhibitions,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The Leventis Gallery is an attractive, apparently well-funded museum that seems to have uncommonly high standards of museumship. Particularly light-sensitive materials are kept behind sliding panels, which is a nice solution to that problem. The sound of them sliding can initially be a little surprising, but I found that after I'd been there a little while, I actually found it reassuring.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This was a real surprise. The gallery is spacious with some paintings by very famous artists: Chagall, Monet, El Greco.Good audio guide (in English)",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This gallery is just the right size; not so big as to induce visual burnout, but large enough to encompass a rewarding overview of European art. There are three floors: the top is devoted to Greek artists, a subject I knew little about but which immediately captivated me with the range and skill displayed. The middle floor covered the more familiar, with a stunning El Greco, Canalettos, Monet, Chagall, and others well represented. The ground floor housed the work of Cypriot artists, or, more accurately, Greek Cypriot artists, as I couldn't find a single Turkish Cypriot artist represented - the only failing of this collection, although quite a major one.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Leventis gallery is a a modern gallery with paintings of famous artists from all around the world f.ex. El Greco, Mone.... Moreover there are also brilliant paintings from greek and cypriot artists. The atmosthphere is also remarkable and there are also e-guides in many languages. Furthermore the prices at the gift shop are reasonable. The most remarkable in the gallery is the secure you feel and the way that the paintings are exposed. Congratulations Leventis Gallery!!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A stone's throw away from the old city centre, this lovely relatively new entry in the cultural scene of Nicosia, hosts permanent as well as temporary exhibitions. A visionary, Anastasios Leventis, donated valuable works of art to be included In the permanent collection at the Museum. Among the exhibits there are important paintings of Cypriot artist but also of internationally acclaimed painters such as El Greco, Monet and Signac. Make sure to include it in your sightseeing plans when in Nicosia!",A G Leventis Gallery

50,"Been surrounded by the name of Leventis since i was a kid. With there new building they have outdated the Cyprus government controlled museums etc. Calm and relaxation and culture. Don't miss it. The paintings don not lack the presence of grate European artists and that its not all. Renaissance, abstract, folk. All blended in harmony. Little tough to park but that is not the problem. One of the jewels of Cyprus. Visit it.",A G Leventis Gallery

50,"a very interesting Gallery , one of the very few of Nicosia. A/c system is excellent a really important 'detail' when outside temperature reaches 43 degrees.....Staff is very friendly,entrance fee very reasonable, paintings and items very interesting. Extremely quiet . We have enjoyed our visit and definitely will visit again.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The gallery is located in the heart of Nicosia, capital of Cyprus. It's a new gallery so it's has been purpose built , using the latest technology for exhibiting the paintings. Engravings or other sensitive pieces of art, are in concealed placards which become visible when pressing a button.The gallery hosts art by the best known Cypriot artists including the painting "" The world of Cyprus "" by Diamantis. Apart from Cypriot artists it even hosts one painting by El Greco . Visiting the gallery is a lovely way to spend some time in Nicosia , specially during the hot summer months .",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"When one enters the Leventis Art Gallery one is surprised by the presentation, curatorial exactness of the 800 drawings, paintings and sculptures and the professionalism of the staff of this treasure trove in the middle of Nicosia. Established by the philanthropist Anastasios G. Leventis it is found on the street re named after this widely respected Cypriot benefactor. Housing works from the 15th to the 20th century it includes works by the Fauves, Impressionists, Cubists and it other art movements. It includes a superb collection of Cypriot and mainland Greek modernist art. The jewel in the crown is an El Greco Saint Francis of Assisi portrait study. Please note that many works are shielded from the light by sliding panels and one needs to press a nearby silver button to see them. Included in the Gallery is the superb collection of Nestor and Aliki Telloglou. Well worth a visit.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"New gallery which opened in Nicosia a couple of years ago. Easy to find, near Solomou bus station in city centre. Beautiful,building ,fantastic archetures .The collections are art and exhibitions from the Leventis foundation and their own private collections. Fabulous period furniture , fro. Paris. Avenue Foche, old masters paintings, also have other exhibitions. I feel that the department For the 'souvenir, are very overpriced , however I visited on Museum day in May, and bought two books on Cypriot history for ten euros each , instead of probably 25. Nice trendy cafe , nouvelle cuisine ! Again expensive , snacks food .",A G Leventis Gallery

50,"The visit it was fun. they have three very interesting collections: Greek, French and Cypriot. The painting of Diamantis in the cypriot collection is very impressive. The Paris room makes you feel that you are in Paris and the greek collection shows the different schools of grek artist and how they were influenced by thei teachers. the reastaurant is very good and the shop offers the opportunity to buy nice gifts at reasonable prices.",A G Leventis Gallery
30,"A beautiful building with well-displayed art. A few paintings by artists like Renoir, Cezanne, and Chagall. But the real reason to visit is to learn how artistic trends elsewhere (e.g. Cubism) spread to the artists in Cyprus.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Truly outstanding for Cyprus standards! A must see if you are in Nicosia and you are an art lover. Cypriot, Greek as well as art from outstanding European grand masters (Monet, etc)",A G Leventis Gallery
50,The restaurant is within the Leventis art gallery and within walking distance of Makarios av. with a lot of shops restaurants bars and coffee shops. Try their salads all of them are excellent. te place is popular and a reservation is essential it is open only for lunch.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,I was astonished by the collection of artwork available at AG Leventis Gallery. Valuable paintings of the world's most reknowned artists such as Clause Monet and El Greco feature among the gallery's collection of paintings! I just feel so relaxed when i enter into the 'Impressionists' room and enjoy those treasures. The Leventis family should be congradulated for sharing making this collection accessible to the public! The elegant coffee shop/ restaurant in the ground floor is the best way to end your journey in art! Simply extraordinary :))),A G Leventis Gallery
50,It has free access to the public and includes the entire collection of the Leventis projects. Great and very interesting opens its doors to visitors to admire this the legacy,A G Leventis Gallery
50,Beautifully laid put with some amazing exhibits. Well worth a visit if in Nicosia. Also have lunch in their restaurant. Good food and friendly service.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"All the contents of this good-sized museum come from the private collection of A. G. Leventis (hence, the name). There is a nice collection of Cyprus oriented art, with descriptions in both Greek and English.There are multiple guards on every floor, presumably to keep visitors from touching the artwork. All are very pleasant, and each one we interacted with had at least a basic level of English, and were able to answer questions.We were there on a Tuesday afternoon, and had the entire museum to ourselves. It was rather nice not to have to compete with a throng of others trying to see the same painting at the same time.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"This is a well organised, modern art gallery with some wonderful pictures on exhibition. Just outside the gallery is a great restaurant for a delicious lunch.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,We had a corporate private tour at the leventios gallery. I believe its uniqueness and beautiful exhibits are a privilege for all Cypriots. We all need to allow our selves a two hour through culture. Thank you.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"We couldn't find this gallery on our official tourist maps, perhaps because it is new. It is located a few hundred meters from the Venetian walls of the old city, near the bus station. The modern building is outstanding, everything about the place compares favorably to the world's best museums except for the quality of the collection. That said, the work is beautiful and important. You'll find a good collection of Greek work and familiar names of the Impressionists such as Monet, Sisley, Utrillo, and Signac. The old masters collection has two views of Venice by Canaletto, an El Greco, and a Rubens, but otherwise the works are by lesser known artists. You can see everything in sixty to ninety minutes.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The collection is not very large, compared with others in large European or American metropoles.However, it is very well organized, with English-language detailed explanations.The collection is hosted in a modern building, that is well adapted for its purposes.Well worth one hour or so that the visit takes.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"The gallery is housed in a modern building in the heart of Nicosia. All three of its collections namely the Paris Collection, the Greek Collection and the Cypriot Collection are wonderful and feature works by some very well known artists. Its temporary exhibitions are also well worth seeing.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"It is a remarkable private initiative which contributes greatly to the culture of Cyprus. It portrays works by Cypriots and foreign painters. If you can arrange a guided tour within the gallery, you will make the best out of it!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A modern museum in the heart of the city, between the old town-Eleftherias square and Makariou avenue. Also, close to central bus station at Solomou square. Definitely worth spending a few hours there.Extra plus, right across the street there is one of the best gyros in town ;)",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A modern gallery situated in the heart of the capital, featuring wonderful collection and a variety of exhibitions. There's a quality cafe/bar/restaurant at the entrance, as well as a souvenir shop. The gallery often organizes exclusive exhibitions, events and theatrical plays. The staff is helpful, knowledgable and very respectful of the regulations of the gallery, but is very polite and considerate when applying them.A must visit for art lovers be it local or tourists!",A G Leventis Gallery
30,"A great gallery space - with a collection of paintings owned by A.G Leventis - who was a rich Greek Businessman...the gallery houses his personal belongs from his homes in Paris and Nicosia.The collection of European / Greek and Cypriot Painters is beautiful, as is his Paris collection...the modern work is thought provoking.My issue is not with the art but with the vibe of the environment - not friendly, restrictive in my engagement with the staff.The information panels were very staid and anti-Turkish Cypriot and as a Turkis Cypriot committed to reconcilation I found what was written very dangerous in a very propagandist approach.I didn't allow myself to leave - I am interested in transcending differences and as ART is a powerful medium, the A.G Leventis Gallery does not lend itself to progessive or creative outcomes.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This relatively new gallery (a couple or years old, I believe) is a world-class venue. Superb layout, a wonderful collection of paintings from Cyprus on the ground floor, works of art from Old Masters to Modernists on the first floor, and from Greece on the second floor: a conucopia of delights, and manageable in a couple of hours, after delicious food and coffee in a stylish cafe/bar/restaurant. We visited this straight after the archaeological museum, and the contract in presentation was marked: the museum needs a great deal of thought to enhance the visitor experience; this gallery has got everything spot on. Multimedia guides are available - the most up-to-date of hi-tech information and help. Very highly recommended!!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A truly modern museum of the private collection of A.G.Leventis which includes 3 floors of art from Cyprus, Paris and Greece. Well laid out and plenty of extra events. The coffee shop and art shop are run separately of the Gallery. Well located just off the famous Ledra Street - it is well within walking distance of the Leventis Museum just off Ledra Street.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Great collections, interesting exhibitions, friendly people. A must-visit gallery, a true ornament for Nicosia!",A G Leventis Gallery
40,Apart from the very unfriendly woman at the reception I liked this museum a lot. Noteworthy are the exhibits you open by pushing a button. Some great masters here.,A G Leventis Gallery
40,"This is a very pleasant place to visit. In addition to Cypriot Art, artists from Greece are also covered.In addition there is an important selection from Renaissance and occasionally special events and exhibitions are covered.You can also spent a relaxing time afterwards for coffee or o light meal.It is worth visiting and the cost is so low.",A G Leventis Gallery

50,"On my last two visits to Nicosia I visited the Leventis Gallery.Outstanding collection of European paintings with a lots of surprises. The Greek Cypriot rooms I particularly enjoyed.The whole exhibition space is extremely well mounted and would not look out of place in NY, London or Paris.An absolute must visit.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Great art, great events for kids - unmissable! The collections are very broad- from Greek and Cypriot painting to the Old masters - Canaletto to Chagall. There is a lot of digital technology to make things really easy-access for those of us who don't know that much about art - plus a digital wall when you go in so you can pick your way to what you want to see. Sculptural lights by Michael Anastassiades and Louis Xv furniture if you are into design design. Overall fun, very kids friendly - highly recommended.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Great paintings from a wide variety of eras/periods by many famous, and not so famous, artists of the last few hundred years.Wonderful experience.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"If you don't know you miss it. Here they should work a bit. It's located not far from the Cyprus museum, in a new and modern setting. It has three galleries, a Cypriot, an European and a Greek collection. All are beautiful, exquisitely displayed and have information available. The European is dominated by impressionists: Monet, Sisley, Corot, etc. definitely a must for painting aficionados in Nicosia. The visit is rightfully completed by the nice museum shop and restaurant.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The story of A G Leventis, told at the museum, is fascinating, as is his art collection. Easily the best curated exhibition in Nicosia, housed in a beautiful modern building in a city where the overwhelming majority of modern buildings are mediocre.The collection includes works by Chagall, Monet, Sisley, van Dongen, Old Masters, Greek artists and exquisite pieces of Chinese and European porcelain.The shop has some beautiful items such as a plate with a reproduction of the beautiful Chagall, little known since it resides in this private collection.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,Beautiful gallery... love the space...strongly suggest you start at the top and work your way to the bottom... loved mostly Cyprus art.... and do not miss having lunch at their trendy cafe/bistro you will enjoy every bite.,A G Leventis Gallery

50,"A wonderful art gallery with Cypriot artists and famous artists around the world from a personal collection of Mr. Leventi. It is very cheap to enter and worth the visit, a beautiful modern building and a very nice souvenir shop. It will be a pleasant afternoon experience for someone visiting Nicosia. There is always a new expedition that changes every month, also there are frequent events for kids.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,this is an excellent gallery were some of the most important Cypriot artists are in display. don't miss the adamantios diamantis painting on the ground floor. also the cafe of the gallery is exceptional and offers some of the best desserts in town.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Though small (compared to a 'standard' gallery), Leventis is gorgeous, well-displayed, and easy to navigate. There are several floors, accessible with stairs or elevator, and different wings on each floor. We took a large group of elementary students on a field trip, which is chaotic for many reasons, but our students had no issues and were able to complete their assigned activities (identifying different pieces) easily. The staff were helpful and kind.There is a small cafe with a seating area, lockers for bags, and bathrooms throughout. All in all, a beautiful gallery here in Cyprus!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,Well organized newly build gallery with nice personnel and a cosy restaurant on the ground floor. Recommended!,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"A visit at the A.G. Leventis Gallery is highly recommended for people visiting Cyprus as well as Cypriots. The collection of paintings and other works of art is excellent and well organized in a three floor exhibition: the Cyprus, the Greek and the French collections.I visited the gallery on my own and also with a guided tour for the Cypriot collection during the museum days in May. I aim to follow up on events and join a guided tour for the other two collections two since an expert person describing the story behind the paintings gives a new perspective to what you see.The building itself is an interesting piece of modern architecture.And when you finish your visit, there is a small gallery shop with interesting and useful souvenirs. And after that, the restaurant at the ground floor is offering quality dishes for a meal, snacks, or just a refreshing drink or coffee.Enjoy!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"DRAWING AND DESIGNThe A. G. Leventis Gallery and Apartments have been designed in such detail having in mind both the client group and the Gallery's highly bespoke cultural nature. The design principles for the interior finishes and fittings have been studied in great detail to represent the general approach to the whole building: highly advanced technologies and diverse requirements on the functionality of the spaces (e.g. auditorium, reception desk) were some of the required elements during the design process. The design process of the building has been a close collaboration of the design team, the architects and the engineers, under the co-ordination and supervision of the Project Manager, in order to meet the high standards and goals set at the beginning, never forgetting the ecological and safety aspects.INTERIOR DESIGNIn order to design the interior of the A. G. Leventis Gallery, the design team that was set up operates on two levels and in two entities.The first relates to the design of the exhibition spaces for The Paris Collection and The Greek Collection and this has been undertaken by the architectural firm of Sonia Charalambidou and Michel Rossier with its headquarters in Athens; in Cyprus, A. Appios Communications Ltd has undertaken the graphic presentation. With the co-operation of the collections’ head researchers, Evita Arapolglou for The Greek Collection, Myrto Hatzakis for The Paris Collection and Eleni Nikita for The Cyprus Collection and the subject to co-ordination of the Director of the Museum, Loukia Loizou-Hadjigavriel, a museological study was first conducted and a selection made of the works to be exhibited. After that, Sonia Charalambidou and Michel Rossier took over the design of the exhibition spaces.The second level and entity relates to the museographical design of the ground floor spaces and the development of the graphic and semiological approach to the Gallery, as well as the development of its logo. The whole project is coordinated by the Director of the Museum, Loukia Loizou-Hadjigavriel. The museographical work has been undertaken by architect Nayia Savvides and the graphic work by A. Appios Communications Ltd.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"A nice private collection transformed to a very good gallery. It contains three different levels - The local paints, Greek section and the French section.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"The most interesting thing of this gallery is just the building. Unmissable for people interested in architecture. However, the art located inside is not good at all.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This is a gallery of a very high standard - lovely modern building, international standard curation and some lovely examples of Greek, French and Cypriot art.",A G Leventis Gallery
30,"It is ok for Cypriots who don't have access to international art, but as a foreigner, I wouldn't go out of my way for this. Venue is a little sterile/concrete looking, but it is good to see modern museums popping up in the capital. Maybe it will get better with age and events.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This is an excellent Gallery that offers both works of the ""classical Modern"" as well as unique Cypriot art, very well worth seeing.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"At the time of visit, I was the only visitor. It felt a little bit strange, but I enjoyed the rich collection from Mr. Leventis in a new modern museum building. It is a compact museum and I spent about 1,5 h for only 2 euros",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The gallery is easy to get to & has a €2 entry charge which is well worth it. It's closed on Tuesdays. An audio guide €3 is well worth it & can be shared.The design of the gallery is clean, bright & modern & provides such a stunning space for the collection.The collection is impressive & the curation is spot on, navigating visitors through different periods of European ( French & Greek) & African art ( special exhibition). The Cypriot gallery is especially interesting as was the African exhibition. The African gallery gave a real sense of A G Leventis & his achievements.The cafe is light & airy with reasonable prices.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"Nice Location, A lot of great paintings, i particularly loved the cypriot artitsts collection and the huge painting of Michail Kashialos.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"The A.G. Leventis Gallery is a fitting tribute to the memory of the great philanthropist A.G. Leventis. The reconstruction of his office in his Paris appartment is very touching. All the exhibition is worth seeing. The African exhibition on display until October 2015, displays his life in Nigeria and West Africa and is well worth spending time. The products in the Gallery shop are all very tasteful.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Firstly, this gallery is not listed on the standard tourist map provided by hotels. It is easy to find - leave the bus station by the Dionysios Solomos Statue entrance. With the bus station behind you cross the road (there's a light controlled crossing). Keep going straight and you are in AG Leventis Street (formerly Leonidou Street). The AG Leventis Gallery is on the right less than 100m along the road. It is just round a bend and back from the road so not visible from the street entrance.The building itself is stunning from the outside and spacious, light and airy inside.The entrance fee is an incredibly low 2Eur. I also opted for the audio guide for an extra 3Eur. It was well worth the money. The system worked perfectly and allows you to go at your own pace. The information provided is excellent.The reception and security staff are friendly and helpful.As for the collection - all I can say is go to see it. Fabulous, superb. One very unusual aspect is that you can get close enough to the artwork to see the brushwork. Also, there are white glass panels with silver buttons at the side - the art that requires special care is hung there. Press the button and the glass slides open to allow viewing. It then closes automatically.The cafe is pleasant and not overly expensive. The outside area benefits from shade and shelter from the wind.Highly recommended to while away a few hours. Not recommended for small children.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,The building is absolutely amazing and the paintings inside were spectacular. I particularly appreciated the cyprus painters section and the french painters sections. There was also a nice gift shop and a cafe were you can enjoy one of a kind desserts and coffees.,A G Leventis Gallery
50,"I was surprised to find this gallery in the heart of nicosia, it has been at least a year since I was here. This is what you call an unexpected discovery, one that is so hard to find in this city. The overall experience is five stars. Three collections, divided in three floors, my favourite being the french collection, in the second floor. I really wish the best for keeping up with such a precious heritage. Now some recommendations that were a bit bothering: guards are all over the place and come really close to the visitors creating a strangely annoying atmosphere. In all museums they remain discreetly present and do not come all over the place. Secondly the lady in the ground floor responsible for selling souvenirs from the gallery is totally rude. Two or three times she advised us not to touch the items, ok we got that in the first place but...hey chill out, you are not guarding thieves here...someone else is responsible I guess...anyway the staff should a bit more polite, especially in the reception area. Thanks",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"What I most enjoyed about this museum is the extensive collection of Cypriot (and Greek) artists. You realise that for an Island so small, there have been more than a few world class artists",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"This museum, housed at an amazing modern building, offers at its visitors a great collection of paintings and art works. I was suprised to see an El Greco & a Rubens, as well as many other famous Greek painters as Litras and Gizis. Ticket: 2 euros. Really close to the old town.",A G Leventis Gallery

40,"I visited in the morning, chose to get an audio guide as well, and started with the temporary collection. After that and the ground floor, I had to run for lunch, and then returned to continue with the rest.The day was not enough really to make the full out of my audio guide, so I left with the promise of revisiting when the new temporary collection is set, to view something new, and complete the entire tour.Definitely a must if you like art, as it's one of the most well organised and presentable museums/galleries/foundations on the island.There is also a cafe-restaurant in the building, so maybe that's worth your visit if you feel like you need a break as well!",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Excellent staff knowledge of the paintings, artists and history. Also has a very comfortable cafe next door where you can find hot and cold drinks snacks and food at reasonable prices",A G Leventis Gallery

50,"Has a striking range of collections including outstanding paintings, watercolors, prints and drawings from European masters (El Greco, Monet, Renoir and may more) and works from Greek and Cypriot artists. Also a small collection of furniture and objects from the decorative arts.The building is new and the interior spaces are well designed with emphasis on functionality.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"It is outstanding as a Gallery and as a building (the small café is not bad either). Well worth a visit for its three collections, the way the paintings are displayed and the aura around this building.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"We visited Leventis Gallery,that is of great standards, in June for only 2 euro per person.The building is very modern and has all facilities a Gallery must have. All collections, Greek, Cyprus and French are interesting but the French collection is the best, I liked it a lot. After our tour we had coffee at the café of the Gallery that is very nice.There is also a shop for those who are interested about paintings.Worthwhile to be visited by everyone.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,This place is truly sophisticated. It has such civilization in it - from the simplest to the most elaborate.,A G Leventis Gallery
30,"This modern art galley is brand new, with polished stone surfaces everywhere and stylish displays. Over three floors are a private art collection of French, Greek and Cypriot art. The information panels are very well written in English and Greek, and it's worth a visit for €2. But the building feels a little empty and soulless. The cafe and piazza outside always have people enjoying the coffee and the air.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"First you take your time to visit the Gallery and when you have exhausted yourself, you sit at the restaurant where the atmosphere and music are most relaxing and enjoy a wonderful dinner.What they propose is out of the ordinary and tasty. The personnel is smiling and they do their best to serve the clients and keep them happy.",A G Leventis Gallery

40,"Beautiful building and great collection, and the museum restaurant is excellent. Well worth a visit.",A G Leventis Gallery
40,"The new Leventis Art Gallery in Nicosia is housed in a spectacular building near the old walls of the city. The building is a fully-fitted, modern art gallery with well-designed spaces and all the security and environmental controls you would expect. The best parts of the collection are to be found in the Paris rooms, especially those paintings representing the Impressionist and later movements. The rest of the collection is, frankly, a little hum drum. Somehow the other artworks lack passion. There is a good cafe and a shop with the usual museum quality gifties and books. It's good for an afternoon away from the more obvious attractions of Nicosia and certainly a pleasure to see modern museum standards in Cyprus.",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"Nicosia needed something as unique as the A.G. Leventis Gallery. Whether living in Cyprus or just visiting it is worthwhile spending some hours there.The Gallery is open every day except Tuesday 10:00-17:00 | Wednesday 10:00-22:00. It has three main galleries (greek, french and cypriot collections) but you also see fine chinese porcelain and other displays offering a rich cultural ""bath"" !There is also a very good restaurant with excellent service where one can eat or just relax with a cup of coffee. Most reasonable prices and a unique menu.http://www.leventisgallery.org/",A G Leventis Gallery
50,"This brand new art gallery is a must for culture vultures. Located in Nicosia, it is housed in a modern building designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley. It houses the art collection (plus other artifacts) of Anastasios G. Leventis, one of Cyprus' most celebrated philanthropists.There are 3 main galleries which house the permanent exhibitions; the Greek, Cypriot and Paris collections, a gift shop, lecture halls There is also a first rate restaurant, Pinakothiki, on the ground floor which is becoming a magnet for Nicosians and has had first rate reviews in the local press. I was astonished by the eclectic mix of the collections and there is a wonderful recreation of Leventis' study in his Paris appartment. Expect to see works by El Greco, Murillo, Canaletto, Guardi , Gainsborough, Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Pissarro, Also fine Chinese porcelain, Meissen and Sévres wares are on display as are excellent examples of Louis XV and Louis XVI furniture. If you love the Wallace Collection in London, you will surely enjoy this.",A G Leventis Gallery
