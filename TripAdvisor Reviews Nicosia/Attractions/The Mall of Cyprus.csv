40,Excellent place. Going there often! Parking place plenty. Very crowdy at times usually on weekends!!!,The Mall of Cyprus
40,This is a typical modern European shopping center. Very well organised place making the shopping experience a pleasure.,The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Stopped by the Mall of Cyprus and Ikea in Nicosia.The mall is small, larger mall is in Limassol. A good selection of stores and restaurants along with cinema and food court.Great for a couple of hours.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,After the renovation of the mall this year the area of the restaurant and cafe totally change...is amazing especially if you sit outside. Also love the kids area with arcades was time for it and Hansel&Gretel.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Still my favorite mall in Nicosia. Good variety of shops and restaurants. Nicely renovated, but restrooms can sometimes be dirty and tacky looking. Bulky soap dispensers make it difficult to wash. They too need a renovation now..",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Finally the renovation of The Mall of Cyprus is now finished. There are a few more shops to choose from and the the food and beverage Village has moved. All the cafes I have also performed a facelift which is very pleasant. There is now also a Paul brasserie which is not only for coffee but has great food as well. But the most important Factor about the renovation is the increased parking space which has been a problem since it was built. I think now with double parking spaces. However it is still not resolved the problem with the congestion. I have not researched it completely but I think there are no new entrances into the parking areas. Also, it would be good to be able to get some piece of paper from each parking spot so that you don't lose it as now they are too big. Still not enough things to do for children which get bored in the cafe.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,Mall of Cyprus has finally achieved the name it should be at.With its amazing renovation it has managed to fit more shops inside and be more roomy-ish. The parking is now huge with 3-4 decks of parking.Great upgrade.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,With renovation done recently is much better. You can find different kind of shops and restaurants. The parking area is larger and most important is that you have accesses from different level now. The cinema should be renovated and upgraded. During hot days is good to visit this mall.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Nice place to do some shopping, with lots of dining places and a large food hall to sit. Lots of stores.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,Its a big mall....lots of nice shops....and restaurants with delicious food....there is a good bus connection from Nicosia center to the mall.,The Mall of Cyprus
50,The newly expanded and refurbished mall offers a nice variety of stores to eat and shop at with lots of parking. Cleaner and better run than the newer Nicosia mall in my opinion.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"We were in this Mall during Easter vacation 2019 and spent half a day there. We found almost everything we wanted: a range of shoe and fashion shops, sport specialists, several national and int'l coffee bars (starbucks is the most expensive), and a supermarket with a good selection of daily needed things, diary, bread, drinks, sweets, hygiene articles etc. (Even some ""made in cyprus"" products). There's a food court with TGI Fridays, McD, KFC, BurgerKing, tacobell, chopstick and Pauls coffee, mainly fast food as usual. The cinema in the upper level offered 2-3 movies in english. Very positive: many clean bathrooms, toilets on every level. Lots of parking space.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,The mall is slightly on the small side - so there isnt that many shops to see.....but it will be expanding shortly so this issue will be overcome. Parking is easy - on site underground parking available free of charge.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,The Mall of Cyprus is an ideal destination if Shopping is on the Menu. With a Good selection of Differing Shops plus Food & Coffee Outlets the whole family can be satisfied. Free Car Parking and WiFi helps with the budget and Air Con keeps the Temperature just right.,The Mall of Cyprus
10,"Disappointing, a few shops under one roof. After walking around decided to have a drink and was absolutely horrified at the state of the outside area. The birds are free to fly in and eat any food left over and make a mess on the tables and chairs...... disgusting.....how difficult can it be to put a mesh up to stop the birds???",The Mall of Cyprus
10,"If you want to sit outside with your food, I wouldn't recommend it. There is bird sh*t on every chair. As we left, I saw a table with leftover KFC being picked over by four birds. Absolutely disgusting. Very disappointed in this since they seem to make little effort to clean and there is absolutely nothing in place to stop birds from scavenging. The shade sails are all torn and falling apart and frankly the whole area needs refurbishment.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"Went to the Mall and came across the following HighlightsTGI' Friday's was absolutely fantastic had their top burgers with starters beers and desserts for just Under 50 euros , brilliantThen we Went into the Public Multi Media shop found it a bit expensive, used the toilets very clean every thing working ok .Ta Tim Constantinou",The Mall of Cyprus
10,A very small collection of shops and fast food over three very small floors.The parking is inadequate - be aware that they don't like using parking spaces in Cyprus.,The Mall of Cyprus
30,"The mall needs a lot of work and even then it will not be something worth visiting. It has lot of shops, mostly cheep teenage lines, but there is not a good place to eat or drink a coffee",The Mall of Cyprus
50,Very large mall and very clean! Large variety of stores and is definitely a great place to hangout or go shopping.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"It’s not that big, but it’s full of shops, cafes, & restaurants.. you can find many good options for whatever you need.. I didn’t have enough time to have a full tour, I only had an hour , however I had many good stuff.. there are also many shops for toys if you are interested.",The Mall of Cyprus
20,"Okay to visit if its scorching hot to escape the heat (or rain in winter i guess), but to be honest after an hour you will be bored. small, lack of decent shops and mostly overpriced compared to most shopping malls. Probably come back if ever passing but only to get a taco bell,other than that staff seem ignorant and unhelpful, typical cypriot shrugs. upside is, it does have a cinema, toilets are clean and like i say it has taco bell.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Than other malls, this one is smaller and nice and now they try to make it bigger. The problem is that they need to bring more brands and new brands, what people search nowadays.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,Nice mall with a variety of shops that can cover all your needs & family needs. Has a cinema. Free Parking. Has also a food court with a vareity of fast food restaurants.,The Mall of Cyprus

20,"I am from England and was visiting Nicosia for the day so decided to swing-by ""The Mall of Cyprus"" on public transport a local Bus from Nicosia Bus Station to the Mall.On arrival getting off the Bus, you walk via an underground car park then past Ikea to inside the Mall.I was soo disappointed as not that many shops. Even more disappointing was the ""Swarovski"" store upstairs - the prices being a lot more expensive than the Swarovski UK store so I left empty-handed.I visited on a Saturday which was ultra busy with locals at the Cinema and eateries. There is nothing special at this Mall and it is very gloomy inside. I did spot Debenhams and a few well-known stores, but I was not fussed abt them. I was searching for classy stores, sadly you will not find a touch of class at this Mall.I stopped by the Information deak downstairs, and staff was helpful to me giving directions to the main Coach stops back to Ayia Napa (cost only 9euro return).The Coach stop is located outside the big Hospital.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,We were meeting friends at the Mall and it’s an ideal meeting place. Many many name stores as well as a number of Car Dealers in the vicinity.

50,"This is a great shopping center, with good shops, restaurants / bars, cinema. I highly recommend it.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,The Mall of Cyprus is an ideal visit for those shopaholics amongst the population. Many many stores and outlets selling most things and a number of Eateries and Coffee Outlets to allow you to have a break and sit and relax. Free and Plentiful Parking on Site helps and The Mall is easily accessible from the City and Motorway.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Good air conditioning. Plenty of space in the parking. We had a great full day of shopping, good variety of shpos and brands. We had lunch at TGI ehich was nice ...but not exactly the TGI we are familiar with in th US.Overall nice day of shopping..",The Mall of Cyprus
50,If you are looking for a nice place to go shopping then here is a place with most things. It has got plenty of different types of shops from electrical to baby to fashion. The food mall is good for a snack and the cinema is upstairs. There is plenty of parking and it's worth a visit.You can stroll round and cover everything in about and hour and a half.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,We found many things which we didn't find in other shops. For example when coming to Zara in Limassol there were less clothes and discounts than in Nicosia. If you have choice and travel with children then you would better go to My Mall Limassol!,The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Nicosia in summer is really hot and ever so occasionally, common sense dictates that you need to cool down! There are a few shops here which are worth visiting but it is on the small side - that said, the supermarket is good if you are self-catering and there is an Ikea next door if you need cheap food (or to replace something you broke in your hotel after too much ouzo)! Go for the under-cover parking if you are staying for any length of time.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Good foodcourt with TGIF, Starbucks etc clean toilets and also a very nice arcade close to it. The shopping is good and you will find many mainstream brands here although we would have liked to see a bigger selection of stores to make the experience really great.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"As a local, I visit the place quite often. It has a large underground parking. The variety of shops is average. The food court gives you a few options for lunch. The cinema screens have a good variety of films. I usually visit the place if I want to buy a gift and want to avoid the heat outside OR to visit the cinema with the kids on a Sunday morning and then have lunch afterwards.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"You'll find the usual shops (Zara, bershka, forever21..etc).Restaurants available are mostly junk food. It is only a 15 minute drive from central Nicosia. Zara there usually has a good collection, for make up there is inglot and Mac in Debenhams. Not too crowded (even on weekends). There is also a cinema on the the third floor. It is not a MUST visit in Cyprus, pretty average mall.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"The mall is small it has a few annexes around it but for ne it is enough for me to find what i need.Weekends are much busier than weekdays.The mall is always kept clean and maintained , i visit it very often and so i will continue to do because it is so practical.My opinion is that it is big enough for Cyprus standards.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,The mall of Cyprus is a small mall but for shopping is very good it is have cinema in it is an original mall,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Good with some great brands.Zara, Mango, Bareto ( great Italian shoes)Clean , friendly easy to get too",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Have just come back, from this Mall. And IT WAS NICE.. not to Big and not to small.And they have a food corner to.. Nice with some time, away from the Sun.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,For shopping its ok but i bought most of my items to take home outside from street vendors at a more affordable price.. its ok but no special attractions .. but i guess good for shopping . not my bag,The Mall of Cyprus
20,"I went for the mall to be very big and awesome with many shops, but it was too small and boring, I really didn't enjoyed it, no variety of anything.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Well, I am sure you have been in shopping malls. I cant really understand why a tourist would like to go there... it's a mall with small shops (and expensive prices too).",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Well the place is surely worth visitingIt does host the usual companies from shopping to eatingFrom zara,ovs,public to mc donalds, starbucks...The place has a large..... LARGEParking underneath.... tho.. Could get easily get crowded..Great shopping experience",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Vast variety of shops, restaurants, would like to have some other shops like Beauty line, H&M. Lacks parking spaces on busy seasons.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"Every time i enjoy a lot in that place. Have cinema, shops, coffe shops and restaurants ...... have everything",The Mall of Cyprus
30,Usual international companies. There's a lot to choose from when it comes to eating. Nice mall to buy souvenir candies downstairs.,The Mall of Cyprus
30,As malls go the mall of Cyprus is bog standard and very very noisy due to bad acoustics and lots of unruly children when schools out.. there are some pluses though.. has a good variety of shops..very clean toilets with disabled facilities you can get a decent coffee and the information booth is very helpful and has wheelchairs to borrow which is great news..free car parking. . The food area is always crowded and noisy but the variety is OK. .saving grace of the whole place is a very good ikea with a massive canteen.. don't go on Tuesdays as this is the cheapo breakfast day and everyone goes.. it is packed solid that morning ..also Saturdays it is very busy with people and lots of kids racing about....but again clean disabled accessible toilets wheelchairs available and disabled parking both downstairs and at the front entrance..same at the mall,The Mall of Cyprus

40,"Very good for shopping, ok for fast food but has awful sound. Very good for cinema night! Big underground parking. Very modern. Good for the hot days of Cyprus summer!!!",The Mall of Cyprus
20,"This is not a good mall. It is small, has very few businesses and nothing that is local or unique. Not worth visiting",The Mall of Cyprus
50,We spent 3 hours here and had a great shopping experience. This mall is a 7 euro bus ride round trip from Larnaca.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,Good mall. Good shops. We enjoyed and managed to get a couple of things. Great is the supermarket inside the mall.,The Mall of Cyprus
30,It's an OK mall. Not better than Paphos Mall. I think the Paphos Mall is the best mall in Cyprus. Overall it's OK,The Mall of Cyprus
40,The mall is not as big as the other malls around Europe but for the local standards its very big. With a good variety of shops and restaurants. You can spend a day there shopping and relaxing. It was too noisy though on a weekend. I would prefer to go back in a week day where is not that busy.,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Not a huge place compared to malls around the world but definitely you will spend a nice time shopping a wide variety of items from most of the famous international brands and food choices are good and fulfilling some cinemas are available too, a good time out all year round...",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Great range of restaurants and coffee shops, several big brand shops and a two storey Debenhams. Prices high, even by European standards.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"The mall area is huge but the shops are extremely limited. Unless you are going for an all exclusive showroom or purchase groceries, I see no reason to visit the place. The limited merchandise and restaurant option was certainly a turn off.Nothing special",The Mall of Cyprus
30,Just your average mall. Not much to see here apart from finding something quick to eat like crepes at Almyro Glyko,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"In term of a shopping mall it is a regular mall. There are some stores that had real discount (such as Zara). At the 2nd floor you will find some nice attraction and activities for the kids. There is a Carousel, some computer games and boots to make activities on the screen, such as puzzles and drawing.Also there is a cinema for kids which we weren't able to get into.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"So I visited the Mall to find some toys for my children and pick up some essentials from the supermarket. The mall has everything you want. I also went to check out Apple TV. There is a electronic and book/toy shop (Public) which had it for £10 more than back home. I must say that this was the case for everything I looked for. There is a assortment of shops and a small food court. It's also clean and easy to park.Look if your looking for a big mall experience, this is not for you. If you are from the UK and expect to find things cheaper you won't in the whole. Maybe in Follie Follie, Masimo Dutti and Zara.If you need to get bits and bobs you will probably find what you want.If its raining, then it might be worth a look",The Mall of Cyprus
20,"I saw many shopping centers and mall of cyprus is neuter. I would say, go there if its raining heavily and you have lots of free time to spend on nothing.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"We spent one day long with my wife and too kids with our friends.The mall is spacious, well decorated, rest rooms are comfortable and clean, all brands and there for adults and kids, great shopping experience for sure, all what you need in one stop shop style.Small area for kids to spend some time until one of the parents do the shopping for the family, coffee from Starbucks for daddy while he's waiting, food court is not that much of goodness, Friday's and KFC sucks.Smoking deck in the food courts is also available.Parking lot is available and bus station is just in front of the mall. The mall has IKEA beside.Enjooooooy.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"I come here with my family to do a weekly shop, there are things here that aren't available in certain parts of Cyprus because of importation.There are clothes stores which aren't available here too for example, topshop, next, debenhams, Starbucks etc. Be warned though, do not expect the same prices as the uk in the clothes stores.Lots of fast food restaurants and desserts available to eat including tgi fridays!Parking here is free and it's easy to access.",The Mall of Cyprus
20,"Certainly this is a typical mall that offers the basics and has nothing to be ashamed of compared to bigger shopping centres in Europe. Nevertheless it is faceless and with no character, you are better off walking old town Nicosia for a more interesting experience.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Please don't think this is an American style big mall. It is a modern air conditioned shopping mall with all the usual types of fashion and consumer goods for sale. It has a Large supermarket, debenhams department store which sells a good range of items including cosmetics & fashion. You can find pretty much what you would expect in a smallish mall. There are a selection of fast food outlets inc TGI and a cinema on the first floor. Parking is easy and it offers good European style shopping",The Mall of Cyprus
50,Like every other mall. Your visit there will be an interesting experience if you have nothing else to do. Other than that nothing special.,The Mall of Cyprus
20,"Another faceless mall. It doesn't offer anything new-certainly not for the kids. There is a Starbucks and TGI Friday's on the top floor as well as other fast food outlets, a cinema and a variety of high street shops including a Debenhams and a Carfour. Fully air-conditioned and hence its attraction I'm assuming. Next to a giant IKEA.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,Shopping center with a variety of brands and fast food to buy and eat and spend good timeShopping center with a variety of Brands,The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Just a standard shopping centre but much better than most shopping streets in the cities. If you are looking for a break from the sun and a bit of shopping then give this place a try, Its free to park and there are a lot of different shops. Many of the shops we have in the UK are also here.",The Mall of Cyprus
20,This Mall is quite disappointing as it has only shops you can find in every big Mall all over the world. Most of the prices for clothes like Next are 15% more expensive than in UK.,The Mall of Cyprus
50,"limited in size and types of shops, but a mall experience all the same. Sometimes very difficult to use the food court, as all the tables are taken.The cinema screen are a good size with a good sound system, so a film is a good way to entertain.",The Mall of Cyprus
20,"Parking - Horrible""Restaurants""- Just fast food and a TGI FridaysCinema - Is okShops - Many shops, for different stuff, though nothing specialVERY crowded, especially on Saturday night.Just a waste of time, seriously nothing special/fun to do.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"If the Mall of Cyprus was mall of UK, i'd put 2/5, but since this is Cyprus, this Mall is very good for the islands standards. Way better place to be than Limassol's MyMall. They could do a better job with the top floor and the restaurants there. When there a lot of people, it feels really crowded and puts you out of the mood to eat. Theres a cinema to throw your kids and lots of stores to leave your wife. It also has a really big Carrefour supermarket, which for me is a good thing. Not only people of the area can buy their grocery, but also the Mall's visitor can buy a snack and eat at a cheap price if he chooses to stay away of the fast foods upstairs.Worth telling than next to the Mall there is the islands only IKEA, so thats how you are going to spend the other half day.",The Mall of Cyprus
20,"It's too small, NOTHING special about it. Loud noises, full of children shouting! Also the toilets were very unclean and disgusting! Find something better to do",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"This is a new mall but nothing special about the shops, attractions of eateries.Spent around 1 hour and a half before I was bored.Easy to get to from Nicosia - around 15-20 minute bus ride. The intercity buses also stop here.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"I have visited many malls all around the world which were really impressive. And this one is an average small one, with nothing special to see or remember.As it concern the parking, you might be lucky not going around half day trying to find an emply place.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Having visited Ikea I popped into the mall for a look around... It took ten minutes! Very small, limited shops and restaurants but suppose it's handy for any last minute items you may need. Although small, it is a well kept mall and nice to mooch about. The worst part was the car park....it may be the most disorganised car park I've ever visited. It doesn't flow easily, all the signs are in Greek, people park like complete buffoons and there are numerous dead ends which go nowhere! Sometimes you'll be in a lane and there is room for two...then there is only room for one car so someone has to reverse...miles back! It's just poorly designed and has not been thought out at all. People park in the road... Blocking the limited access you already have and it is not managed at all by the mall.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"The mall has been our main destination since our baby was born and while my wife was pregnant. It's the only place in Nicosia where you can have a stroll and get away from extreme heat in the summer and cold in the winter.Unfortunately this is how everybody in Nicosia, the surrounding areas and other towns think.Weekdays are quite good. You can easlily park, stroll, window-shop and shop. But the weekends are HELL!!! it takes forever to park, forever to use the elevators, forever to shop and forever to eat.The place is really small for Nicosia. There are plans to extend it but i guess it will take time.Anyway, overall it is a good option to avoid staying at home or walking under the sun or rain, but it is not what Nicosia and Cyprus should have.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"Pretty standard mall, but with nice stores and brand names along with fair prices...also has restaurants and movie theater, so there are some things to do apart from shopping.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"I reside in Nicosia, and visit the Mall of Cyprus every two weeks for grocery, clothing and gifts shopping; the Mall is superb for a relaxed shopping where you have a variety of nice shops and department stores as well as a major supermarket and a good size food court where can have a stop for a bite or a coffee.I enjoyed particularly my last visit as the Mall was very nicely decorated for Christmas; it is great to visit it as family; kids will certainly enjoy the Christmas environment.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,We only spent one day in Nicosia. It was great. We visited the Mall just before we get back to Larnaca. The shops are gathered and that made our life easier. Some of us wanted to eat and there are plenty of choices. Everyone was happy!,The Mall of Cyprus
30,"It is really convenient, especially since in the city center the shops are scattered rather than gathered, so the mall gives you the opportunity to avoid searching for the next interesting shop. However, it is a mall, and even it is new and rather well-organised, it has a standard character if you could say so, or maybe no character at all. It is very popular for families, especially in the weekends and sometimes events for children are organised. If you are staying in Nicosia for just a few days, you should avoid visiting the mall, it doesn't make any sense. If you are living in Nicosia then you will visit it sooner or later.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"I visit cyprus every year to see my family and the mall of cyprus is such a treat for the homesick blues. It's got such a diverse range of restaurants and stores there's something for everyone. there are some fab sales on around August where I've picked up some great bargains. Fully air conditioned so wandering around and trying on clothes is not sticky and unpleasant. there's also lots and lots of parking space. haven't yet seen a film in the cinema, maybe I'll do that next year!",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"When it's raining outside, the Mall of Cyprus is a good place to visit. It offers shopping, cinema, places to eat, performances.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,Biggest mall in nicosia. There are many shops available at average prices and for the whole of the family. Also supermarket available. Really close to IKEA and with plenty of parking spaces and Wifi,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"You have all the usual suspects here including Debenhams. It's air conditioned, easy parking and easy to get around. If you need to go shopping and don't want to get got and bothered then come here.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,I went there for the first time last December. I was a model at a fashion show that took place there. It was an amazing experience. The show was well organized and everyone was very very helpful. The mall itself is not very big. It has a lot of shops and places to eat. It is next to the only ikea in Cyprus. If you ever go to Cyprus capital you have to visit it for sure!!!,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"this Mall in the capital of Cyprus is the place to be when you visit Nicosia.there are many shops with brand names and there are also many fast food restaurants to eat traditional and international food..there is also a cinema,supermarket and a safe parking for your car..this is also the perfect place when it is very hot outside..you will love it!!",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Its not the huge mall that you would normaly see in a big city, but for a town the size of Nicosia its not bad! You have a variation of restaurants/fast foods/ cafes to choose (Fridays, KFC, Starbucks, McDonalds, Pizza hut, Taco bell, Gloria Jeans, Greek kebab, ice cream station etc). There is also a cinema place inside the mall. As for shops you can find brands that you would find on High street. There are some shops for electronics, sports equipment, supermarket etc.",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"There's nothing particularly outstanding about the Mall of Cyprus but it lived up to its name. If you're not from Europe, then there are shops you might not have at home. For a whole day, you might struggle to find things to do: a morning or afternoon is fine. There's a Carrefour if you have shopping to tend to.",The Mall of Cyprus
40,Good but there isn't many shops there!!! Some shops there are big and another shops are very small!!!,The Mall of Cyprus
40,"This mall is located out of the city center and you can reach there of course with car, and the public buses. It is not so big, there is a variety of shops: Clothing, Electronics, Super Market, etc.. Furthermore, there is a multiplex cinema and of course as an eager mall you can find Restaurants, cafes and Fast Food! If you have time for shopping or just a walk it is nice to get there!",The Mall of Cyprus
30,"Visiting the Mall of Cyprus? Well, as a tour guide I sometimes need to stop at the mall as part of the tour's itinerary. The location is easily accessible upon entering Nicosia from the main highway. You just take the exit from the main road and you reach a round about. Take the third exit and then take the first exit on the next round about. You will see the Nicosia General hospital to your right. You will reach another small round about and take the first exit again. If you are traveling with a private car then park on the underground parking so you avoid the hot sun and the heat. Go through one of the main underground entrances and up the escalator. By one of the underground main entrances there is a shoe repair and key shop. There is more traffic and less parking space after 3:00pm daily and after 1:00pm on the weekends. Upon entering the mall you will find two levels: The ground floor, filled with shops, small bakery, an MTN store, a watch shop and other department stores. The top floor has some sport shops, electronics, art shops, and stands selling various goods such as nuts, tea and other items (which are just expensive).On the west part of the upper floor are the cafeterias, the cinema and the restaurants which are well known franchise brands.Now the biggest issue here is the bad acoustic. The actual structure of the mall has no sound absorption and the sounds multiplies. I know some younger ages won't mind because they want to be where the masses are, but when we visit with a tour and there is people with hearing devices then this causes discomfort. I suggest avoid the cafeteria and restaurants section, or make a quick visit and choose to seat on the large veranda outside. You will see it between the Starbucks and TGIF. The only negative thing there, it is a smokers area. So you will need to deal with that issue too. So if you want, you can choose the quiet cafeteria situated on the easter upper floor, for a quick coffee and a drink.More and more malls are being build in Cyprus. My concern is if the consumer's comfort and well being should really be taken under consideration.So my advise is: avoid the cafeteria area unless you really have to go. Seat on the outside area for a meal or a drink.Happy shopping!",The Mall of Cyprus
40,"The Mall of Cyprus is no longer the best mall to shop at now that the Kings Avenue Mall has opened in Paphos, however it is still very modern and has some nice shops which tourists will be familiar with. Like the Paphos mall, it too has a large food court with plenty of restaurants for any tatsebud.",The Mall of Cyprus
50,"Even is winter with rain and cold, even is summer with high temperatures, Mall of Cyprus is the ideal place for Nicosia residents to do their shopping, as there are many shops and a supermarket. Is the meeting- place for friends to take a coffee or dine. Children supposed to spend their time at the playing yard. This is also a choise for those who love cinema. I love this place and i thing many people feel like me, as usually is crowded, especially at Chrismas time with the lovely decoration and so many activities.

30,"If you happen to be in Nicosia and the weather is too bad to enjoy the outdoors, head to the Mall of Cyprus to kill some time. It's not a huge mall, but there are some decent shops (including Zara, Debenham's, Next, Swarovski etc), plus there are some fast food places (McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut), a supermarket, cafeterias and a cinema. IKEA is located right next to the Mall.",The Mall of Cyprus
