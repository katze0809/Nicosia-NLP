40,"This is a well presented and highly interesting museum which contains many documents, photos and items which belonged to the Greek Cypriots involved in the fight for liberation from British rule in the late 1950s.The call for union with Greece became louder in the 1950s but was rejected by the British and EOKA proceeded with a campaign against the occupying power. This led to violent deaths on both sides and there are many grisly photographs showing the sad outcome of the fighting which took place.I can't help thinking that only just over half the Brits who voted for Brexit meant it had to take place because democracy had to be seen to be done - the overwhelming majority (over 97%) of Greek Cypriots who voted for Enosis in the 1950 referendum organised by the Orthodox Church of Cyprus presumably didn't count or matter? They did matter when asked to fight for the Allies during the two world wars at which time they were led to believe that this would lead to Independence for Cyprus.Entrance to the museum is free and there is literature available in pamphlet form to take away. We left feeling quite depressed that the Greek Cypriot people involved in the EOKA struggle found it necessary to risk everything to regain their island.",The National Struggle Museum
40,Go in with eyes wide open. There is always more than one side to a story and this needs to be balanced. It was still good but quite graphic and certain things were not brought up.,The National Struggle Museum
50,I found this museum very moving. There are photographs and documents that detail the struggle of the Greek Cypriot people to gain independence from Britain during the 1950s. It is well laid out. Some of the life-size statue scenes that reside within the museum enhance the overall experience.Visitors should be aware that there are some graphic photos of some of the Greek freedom fighters that were killed with charred or dismembered bodies.This museum should be seen by anyone visiting Nicosia in order to gain an understanding of the psyche of the Greek Cypriot people in their continuing quest for freedom.This museum is free to visit.,The National Struggle Museum
40,Tells the graphic story of EOKA and the Cypriot fight for independence from Britain.Featuring many black and white photos of the era and honouring those greek cypriots who died in this cause.Primarily written info.inGreek with some Englsh translation.,The National Struggle Museum
50,"In this museum gathers the struggle ,the sufferings of a small island to gain its FREEDOM after so many years of British rule.The struggle was uneven and as youngschool boys of 14 to 18years with the idea for FREEDOM against Proffessional ArmyThe british villains were very hard and even passing the RED LINES WHICH WASHANDKING OF THIS YOUNG HEROE STUDENTS .At the end the British use there political stragetyDIVIDE AND RULE",The National Struggle Museum
40,This museum is dedicated to the struggle of Cyprus to gain independence in the 1950s. It is a quiet place to come and read about their Cypriot heroes and the British villains of the era. Some of the black & white photos are graphic but conflict is never going to be without violence and death. Entry is free and it is nice & cool on a hot day.,The National Struggle Museum
40,"After eventually finding the museum which is next to several other museums. We were not charged on entry. There is lots of historic things in here to do with the Cypriot struggle against the British in the 1950's & 60's. It is an eyeopener for us as it tells how bad the British were, but it was a conflict and they did what they had to do.",The National Struggle Museum
10,"Simply a propaganda experience aimed at the 'evil ' British. Much like the Grivas 'Museum ' in Paphos which glorifies terrorism. .....ENOUGH SAID. THE National Struggle Museum in the North of Nicosia gives a far better idea of what was actually going on in the 50s, 60s and 70s. Just my opinion having previously read reports ftom the time.",The National Struggle Museum
30,"From this place, I learned something that I did not know before. Maybe it helps us understand more about international politics.",The National Struggle Museum
50,Was passing this on a self-guided walking tour and looked in - glad I did. interesting displays and gave a real sense of the history - free to enter and just the right amount for me.,The National Struggle Museum
50,We went in search for recent social Cypriot history and certainly found it here. I felt ashamed that I was not aware of what had happened here at the hands of the Brits especially in such recent times - worse for me as I hold a history degree and live in Kent... A lot of thought provoking and harrowing scenes but done in a very informative way and I most certainly recommend a visit here.,The National Struggle Museum
50,you can easily go round in half an hour - everything is so easy to follow and the staff so helpful. it is free - I learnt so much,The National Struggle Museum
40,"As an American I am not fully aware of the ""modern"" history of Cyprus from British colony to independence to Turkish invasion in 1974.This excellent museum will cover that history and the sacrifices of Cypriot heroes to gain an independent Cyprus. Some things aren't appropriate for small children (images of dead martyrs, the noises hanging in the atrium) but they are very effective.It would be great if there were more captions in English and I think there are efforts to improve this for foreign visitors.Helpful staff. Clean toilets.Easy to locate near the Folk Art and Byzantine Museums. Opposite the Panhellenic Gynmasium.",The National Struggle Museum
50,This museum brings alive the struggle for independenceIt’s very well explained and creates a shocking picture how the locals survived this horrible part of history.,The National Struggle Museum
20,"This is about the revolt against British control, but really it is about ""heroes and suffering"" of which the Cypriots had plenty at the rather brutish hands of the Brits. However, I was interested in getting an understanding of how the independence was achieved, yet that seemed lost, it was more isolated examples of various acts, lacking a clear timeline and clear discussion of the political development, which I never got straight.",The National Struggle Museum
40,"The museum currently hosts a special exhibit focused on the detention camps into which the british put the cypriots.Some larger posters were translated, but many smaller posters, letters ect. were only in greek.The permanent exhibit was interesting, but with quite few things on display, many of which seem less interesting, if one can't read the story behind due to most being only in greek.The full museum can be seem in 60-90 minutes.",The National Struggle Museum
50,A museum detailing the struggle of Cypriots against the British Colonial rule between 1955 and 1959.Many exhibitis detailing the struggle and keeping the memory of the victims and fighters alive.,The National Struggle Museum
40,"The museum is interesting for its perspective and to recognize the Greek Cypriot struggle for liberation. It veers toward hagiography and overblown prose - such as describing the incident where 4 bomb makers blew themselves up as a ""holocaust"" and the British detention centers - however unjust they may have been - as concentration camps. Also of note, apparently women had no role in this struggle.",The National Struggle Museum
40,"The struggle to free the Cypriots from the British colonisation is well documented from the resistance perespective. Not sure I would be comfortable visiting with younger children given the graphic images in some of the pictures. A reasonable number of translations into English, some more would enhance the experience.",The National Struggle Museum
40,"Well kept, but the real concentration camp in Kokkinotrimithis village, not far from Nicosia is much better, open air museum, including the barracs where prisoners were kept by the british, during 1955-1959 struggle against them.",The National Struggle Museum
30,"Firstly can I endorse a point made by another traveller.This is very badly signposted.I had to ask a local who kindly showed me to the Museum.The groundfloor is full of photos of incidents.No English translation.So all we see mainly are British soldiers at the site of an incident.The first floor is better as there are English translations.There is one truly horrific picture of the bodies of 4 bombmakers whose bomb exploded in their faces.One of the bodies comprises two feet and a pile of disintegrated remains.The upper floor is a tribute to those Greeks who were killed,with only one brief mention of the death of a British servicoman.No mention of the innoceit civilian killed.Mention is made of the 1974 invasion.However all the blame is on the other side.All I can say is in the light of current events I find it difficult to accept martyrdom shown to those who have blown up innoceit people,whatever the justification of their cause.",The National Struggle Museum
50,"It is very difficult for every visitor of the museum, especially of Greek origin, to hold his or her tears when visiting that museum.Thousands of photos, items, documents, give visitor a clear view of the Struggle of Greek Cypriots for liberation from the British occupation.Ideal for any visitor of Cyprus with interest in modern history, a MUST SEE for all Greeks!",The National Struggle Museum

40,This museum focus on the national liberarion struggle against the British in the period 1955 - 1959. Interesting for people who want to know more about his.,The National Struggle Museum
50,"Gives you a real insight into the difficulties...hindsight is a wonderful thing, but how could we have got ourselves into this? Many photos don't have an English caption so unless you've seen them before, you don't know what you are looking at. Poignant letter from executed youngster to his brother. Perhaps they could find him and get a spoken testimony before it's too late. Or is the mother still alive? I helped with a bit of translation, such enthusiastic, sincere young men at the gallery",The National Struggle Museum
40,Didn't get to go on this trip as it closes early. You are shown around by the soldiers as it is on one of their bases.,The National Struggle Museum
40,"When you build the museum you get to tell the story you want told. With that in mind this is worth a visit. Focusing on the national struggle against the United Kingdom the museum is full of photos, copies of letters, arrst warrants and artifacts.From a distance the museum may look closed but do give the door a push and double check.",The National Struggle Museum
50,Superbly curated and presented exhibits that show the history of the 1954-59 revolt against the British Empire. The Museum also stands a a war memorial for the fighters who died in that struggle for Cyprus' independence. A sobering experience when one steps out into modern Cyprus.,The National Struggle Museum
10,Wanted to get a feel for the history of the place. After a struggle locating it (signs are awful around the capital and when there are some they're often bent to face another direction). We arrived 40 minutes before the closing time and they had already closed. Not good enough.,The National Struggle Museum
40,"As museums go it was air-conditioned, well laid out, well presented. However unless you're a daily mail reader and unable to form your own opinions, it comes across as very anti-British, and focuses purely on the British occupation of the island. I won't contest that the British will have had some moments where they were aggressive and not fair in treatment of those trying for independence, the museum makes out in some places that the British occupation equates to the Nazi occupation of Western Europe.Worth visiting, just read into it.",The National Struggle Museum
10,Wanted to visit today but museum closed.After many visits to Greek Cyprus wanted to see the wider picture.Not to be unfortunately,The National Struggle Museum

40,Free museum (near the Byzantine Museum and Art Gallery). Worth a quick look but be warned there are some graphic images.,The National Struggle Museum
50,"I first visited this museum in 1982 - it was bad, very bad. Basically it was a dirty, dusty mess and very dark so you could hardly see anything.I was VERY impressed with what they did with the museum. it is now an excellent story of the national struggle of Cyprus with everything clearly laid out, informative and very well preserved.Well worth a visit!",The National Struggle Museum

50,"Any visitor should see this museum to understand better the facts of the ""struggle"" of the Cypriots.You need a good hour to see it all slowly and have the time to read all the information.The only handicap in this museum is the time it is open - they work as a simple government office .....
