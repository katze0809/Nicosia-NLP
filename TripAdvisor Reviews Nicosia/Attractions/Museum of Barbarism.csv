30,It's one of those strange things that some of make a point of visiting the sites of horror around the world. It's fairly clear that a terrible event did occur here many years ago. The museum is very small and not really easy to find. It's best to employ a taxi driver to find the location. It makes no pretense that it is presenting a balanced view of what occurred there - I don't think that they feel the need to do this. It does simply present information about an historical event and then allows us to make up our own minds based on whatever information we currently hold or are able to garner from a range of sources. Go and have a look - it is definitely worth it.,Museum of Barbarism
50,A place to show you the civilized human beings of europe. Not much to say about it just go and see...,Museum of Barbarism
10,My father was the British RSM RAMC that was in charge of bringing the bodies out of the house. He said that it was so quiet if a pin had dropped there would have a horrendous uproar and he does not agree with the story written here. He read it in the daily telegraph many years ago and was upset as it was not written as it was and he was there. This affected him more than Burma,Museum of Barbarism
10,"This 'museum' is located in one of the busiest and trendiest streets of the Turkish speaking part of the city. It is a crime scene of a family whom were killed in the shower by Greek speaking soldiers during the Cypriot Civil War in 1963. The building is currently under Turkish Military control, and has a lot of biased information on the war (whitewashing what the Turkish speakers did and putting all the blame of the war on the Greek speakers). There is a similar museum in the Greek speaking part of the city with a lot of biased information and propaganda too (this time putting the whole blame on the Turkish speakers and whitewashing what the Greek Cypriots did.). Don't waste your time and energy visiting these places in Cyprus as even the locals don't.",Museum of Barbarism

He was assigned to the regiment sent by the Turkish army as part of the guarantee agreement made when the new Cyprus Republic was established in 1960. On 24th December 1963, while Dr Nihat Ilhan was on duty, his wife, his three children, Kutsi, Tecer, and Hakan along with the house owner Hasan Gudum's wife, Ferida Gudum were killed by the Greek Cypriots.
