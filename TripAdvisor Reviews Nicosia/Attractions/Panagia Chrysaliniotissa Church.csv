50,"A beautiful small 15th century Orthodox church, located in the old part of Nicosia town. Icon Madre della Consolazione transfered in the Vyzantino Museum of the Archbishopic Plalace.",Panagia Chrysaliniotissa Church
50,I visit the church in a quiet Saturday morning and I had a great time there! This Byzantine church is inside the old city of Leukosia and has a very interesting architecture! The church is made from stone and the interior is very beautiful ! Cyprus has a great collection of Christian temples and in my opinion this one is one of the greatest you can visit in the old town!,Panagia Chrysaliniotissa Church
40,"This is another church set in sandstone with a nice compact and well kept garden. The church itself has a steeple, domes and large windows and proudly flies the Greek flag high at it's front door. Unfortunately I cannot comment on it's interior as again another of these little churches were not open.",Panagia Chrysaliniotissa Church
50,"Quite smallish, but very cute little church in Lefkosia. Chrisaliniotissa is one of the many names for the Virgin Mary, and in this case means ""gold wool"". It's quite a shallow church, and completely made from stone; one is allowed inside, but no photographs. It was nice inside, it was just a small room, quite old and with beautiful wall paintings. The church people were also very friendly. Worth a look!",Panagia Chrysaliniotissa Church
40,"A religious symbol for Nicosia, very well known to locals. A traditional Greek Orthodox church with its own history a visitor should learn.",Panagia Chrysaliniotissa Church
50,"The Church of Panagia Chrysaliniotissa is situated within the old city of Nicosia very near to the green line. This Byzantine Church was built in stone the year 1450 and many additions were made to the original structure which led to many rooms inside; each has its own holiness and history.The external structure is unique; the arched corridors are really impressive; and the metallic white doors carry beautiful designs.The lights are very scarce inside which add to the holiness; the Altars, the Dome, the Ceiling, the Icons, the Chandeliers, the Paintings, the Engraved Beautiful Stand, Cabinets and Chairs are really wonderful. We missed seeing some of the icons as they were covered with black covers in preparation for the Good Friday celebrations.",Panagia Chrysaliniotissa Church
