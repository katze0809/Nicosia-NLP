40,Shacolas Tower is one of the highest building in Nicosia. You can see panoramic view to whole city and also there is a nice view to Turkish flag which is located in the mountains. Staff of the museum is really nice and helpful. You can also read there some interesting facts about Nicosia.,Shacolas Tower
50,"Great panoramic views of the entire city, including the northern part. Views across to the surrounding country and mountains. Within the observatory, there are photos with descriptions of what you can see looking straight out in that direction. You can clearly see the green line between the north and the south. Very small admission fee. Spend a bit of time to watch the video.",Shacolas Tower
40,"If you are in the area, I would definitely go and see the Shacolas tower, being the highest building there you get to have 360 degree views of the whole of Nicosia, lots of interesting facts when you are at the top of the building as well. I really enjoyed my visit.",Shacolas Tower
50,You can see panoramic views of all. The free and also the occupied part. There is also a video that shows the history of the city.,Shacolas Tower
40,"2.5€ to see Nicosia from above. Very interesting. You won’t see anything that stands out too much, no real visible divide, but you can see both parts of Nicosia. Don’t have too high expectations and embrace what you can see.Windows are a bit dirty but whoever cleans them is a brave person, I wouldn’t want to do it every morning, you can see through them fine.Toilets were a disgrace when I went there but they weren’t the reason I went and it was free so can’t knock it too much.",Shacolas Tower
50,Fast lifts take you up go the eleventh floor for panoramic views across the Old City to the mountains.There is a short video presentation and information detailing Nicosia's history and touch-point diagrams identifying important buildingsEntry is 2.5 euros and the tower is easily located in the H and M building just off Ledra Street.,Shacolas Tower
50,Amazing building where you can see nicosia from above. You can see the beautiful mountain of Pentadaktylos,Shacolas Tower
50,"Great place to start your first day in Nicosia. Only cost 2,5€. You can see over a large part of the city (including the Turkish side). There are also touch screens where you get info on important buildings in your sight. And some local history.",Shacolas Tower
50,Go down side street of H &M on Ledra Street and take lift to top. For €2.50pp you get a 360 degree view of Nicosia with helpful touch screen guides to sites and a short film of the history. Cyprus has a lot of history both ancient and modern - to 1974.,Shacolas Tower
50,The best place to view and appreciate the layout of the old city. Well presented touch screens to identify significant sites in the city. An informative video presentation of the history of the city.I find this the best place to take friends on their first visit to the city befor heading off on foot to explore,Shacolas Tower
40,"this is the place to go see nicosia from aboveat 11 floor the view is greatgood info grapics when the work, it would be good with some more details on the grene line",Shacolas Tower
50,"You can find this tower at middle of Ledra street, the commercial pedestrian road at the center of the old Nicosia town. At the 11th floor of the building where is H&S shop, you can see a great view of the old Nicosia town.",Shacolas Tower
30,If you visiting the old Nicosia's streets the tower worth a visit.... the entrance fee is low and you can see the entire Nicosia all around....inside there a small photo exhibition,Shacolas Tower
40,Shacolas Tower museum and observatory is located just off Ledra Street on the 11th floor which can be reached by a fast lift. The viewing area gives a 360-degree view of the city and the helpful picture/information guides dotted around the site provide details of what is to be seen. Entrance fee is 2.50 Euro.,Shacolas Tower
50,"The official name of this attraction, the Ledra Museum -Observatory, is a bit misleading. Firstly, you’re inclined to think that the entrance to the observatory is on Ledra Street. It isn’t. It’s on Arsinios Street, just beyond the H and M Store. The entrance to the ShakolasTowere is clearly signed; just head up the stairs and take the lift to the 11th floor. Secondly, it’s hardly a museum. There’s a bit of an exhibition (albeit small) of photographs and descriptions of Old Lefkosia in cooperation with the Leventis Museum of Lefkosia, and an interesting but seriously outdated video screening of some of the history of the city. But don’t let that deter you. It’s really worth seeking out, as you will have a view like no other! Primarily it’s an observation deck, and one that is absolutely worth a visit.The observatory on the 11th floor of the Shakolas Tower, the tallest building within the old walled city. It provides a unique, unobstructed panoramic view of the whole Nicosia (Lefkosia in the south and Lefkoşa in the north. I love city views, but this one is particularly emotive, for you will see a city as it should be, a city which was built to be united, not divided - a city as a whole, not the divided city that it actually is.The view is the best you will get in Nicosia. The day was clear and sunny, and the 360 views were excellent. You could easily make out the various landmarks, and interactive maps in front of the viewing windows will help those not familiar with the layout of the city. You’ll easily find Ledra Street with its sun shades, and then should be able to make out the Green Line. In the west you’ll pick out the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church which in part lies within the UN buffer zone. As you look across to Lefkoşa in the north, you’ll see the soaring minarets (and the Gothic structure) of the Selimiye Cami Mosque; to the left of that you’ll be able to make out the square shape of the Buyuk Han, with its curious chimneys. Looking beyond that you’ll see the flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus emblazoned upon the mountain beyond; it’s a poignant, stark reminder of the reality of this city. As you look south, you’ll see the modern part of Lefkosia sprawling into the distance.Due to the fact that Nicosia is the only divided capital city in the world, the view you have will be unique, and probably evoke some personal feelings. I certainly appreciated the opportunity to visit this landmark, and recommend it highly. It costs the princely sum of €2.50. You can stay as long as you like. There’s a small shop there for local souvenirs, and a fridge from which cool drinks can be purchased. Toilet facilities are located two floors down, on the 9th floor.The observation deck is open from 11:00 to 19:00 daily.",Shacolas Tower
40,Worth a visit for some fantastic views across Nicosia and across the border. Sad to see the flag of the illegal country on the mountains and can’t imagine how those who used to live there feel seeing it. Lots of history to see and read in the tower and it’s well worth the €2.50 entrance fee however you won’t need to be in there for more than half an hour.,Shacolas Tower
50,At first I was skeptical but then I just went for it and took the elevator up to the 11th floor and walked into a place that reminded me of Top of the Mark without a bar/restaurant! The interactive maps are great to use to identify buildings. The short video history is informative and photographs interesting. It’s small and it was empty late in the day when I went up. I think if there were more than 10 or 15 people there it’d not be as great an experience...,Shacolas Tower
40,"Quite good semi-panoramic view on the city from the 11th floor. No need to pay for the entrance, if needed free wc on the 9th floor.",Shacolas Tower
50,Fast lift to the 11th Floor for 360 degree views of the city. Fascinating looking over the roof tops in all directions. Some history boards and a mini souvenir shop.,Shacolas Tower
30,"Our guidebook recommended going up the tower to the 11th floor because it offered great views over the city. It was worth the euro 2.50 on a clear, sunny day to have such great views. I'd avoid it if the weather isn't good..",Shacolas Tower
50,The interactive map and film were informative about the history of the area. A good way to orient oneself in a city of windy rambling streets.,Shacolas Tower
40,"Shacolas Tower is the bigest tower on Ledra Street, there you have a beautiful view of Nicosia, I recommend you to climb.",Shacolas Tower
50,"This is a great way to get a panoramic view of Nicosia. The view from any window is unobstructed. In addition, there are also some interesting virtual tours allowing you to explore some of the main sites. This is particularly useful if you don't cross the border to go north. Furthermore, there is also an interesting film - available in multiple languages - about Nicosia.Be aware that this place is not easy to find - there is no street signage - the tourist map indicated it was in Ledra Street - but it is actually in a street OFF Ledra Street. In 2019 this observatory is behind the H&M store in Ledra Street.",Shacolas Tower
50,"The tower gives superb views of both sides of the border in Nicosia, and is very much worth visiting. We ascended the tower before crossing the border into Northern Cyprus, and it gave us an amazing view from above. An excellent experience.",Shacolas Tower
50,"This is tucked away behind the H&M shop very close to the crossing between the North and South of Nicosia.The viewing platform is on floor 11, but you can only see the South from here unless you pay, but if you go to the toilets on the 9th floor you can get a good view of the North.Compare and contrast the two areas.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Really worth a visit and have a panoramic 360 degrees view of Nicosia, beautiful divided capital. It costs a couple of euros.",Shacolas Tower
50,It really worths visiting it. The visitor is able to see all. Out all Lefkosia from the 11th floor. Also very sad to realize that Lefkosia is the only European capital which remains separated after the Turkish invasion in 1974.,Shacolas Tower
50,"good place for tourists, nice view, an opportunity for people to learn the history of Cyprus and learn about monuments",Shacolas Tower
50,"Must visit place in Nicosia. On Ledra street, easy to find. Great view to all around the Nicosia with explanations with building etc. Worth to visit if there is no time to walk across all streets and check all objects.",Shacolas Tower
40,Located at 11th floor.. this observatory gives an excellent view of the buildings in the TRNC. We walked the long Ledra Street to the very end to see the custom then walked back to find this building. The entrance is not along Ledra Street but you can find it very near to McDonalds.,Shacolas Tower
40,A beautiful stop to get to know the history. The view from the 11th floor is splendid. 2.5 euros per person entry make sure you visit this place. Its located in the building right above H&M store.,Shacolas Tower
40,"I always recommend this observatory to everyone visiting Nicosia for the first time.It gives a quick overview of Nicosia's history, cultural legacy and historical monuments. It offers panoramic views of the city, maps explaining the most important monuments and places, and a descriptive video (albeit oldish and at times of suboptimal quality) briefly explaining the island's history.",Shacolas Tower
40,"The view is amazing. Although not very high, you get a good view of the surrounding area. If you have binoculars, it would be even better experience.",Shacolas Tower
40,Nicosia is not a high-rise city so being on the 11th storey of the observation tower offers a decent view over the city and across the border into Northern Cyprus. You almost get a 360-degree vista if you crane your neck around the southern facing windows. Don’t miss the film in the centre the room behind the curtains.,Shacolas Tower
50,Very good and quite place. In one small room they explain the history of Nicosia and everything about the war and gates,Shacolas Tower
20,"We were very disappointed in this observatory. It is not that high, so you can see only some parts of the city.I would not recommend going.",Shacolas Tower
20,"It's not much of a museum. It is a decent observatory though, espessially if you bring your own equipment! But even then, if you need good quality pictures you won't get them there as thick, often dirty glass will get between you and a usable shot.",Shacolas Tower
50,Great views with a brief insite into Cypriot history with a short film and plenty of information on display. €2.50 entrance fee and lift access.,Shacolas Tower
40,"This tower is not that high, however it gives you a great view over the entire city. Although the view isn't amazingly pretty it does show you all of North Nicosia and you can clearly see the Turkish flag on the mountain opposite and appreciate the scale of the city. There is a nice video also which tells you all about the cities history. 2.50 Euros per adult, under 12's free.",Shacolas Tower
50,"On the 11th floor of what otherwise appears to be an office block this is a very nice point to view the city and look across the border to the giant Northern Cyprus flag. Large windows cover almost every side so it is good to get your bearings but also pick up some post cards, enjoy a respite from the heat and even use the toilets. There is even a short video history and written history boards.",Shacolas Tower
50,Worth a trip up into this modren tower in Nicosia as the small museum and exhibition is interesting and the views are spectacular.Good signage for oruentation and sightseeing.Small 2 eu fee from memory,Shacolas Tower
50,"I would suggest that this be the first start place in the city. With video documentary and view points via window and the information panels, you could have a very good understand the ample information about the city.",Shacolas Tower
30,"From outside it does not look as anything special and you can hardly see the tower from the very busy Ledra street or nearby streets.The same views can be seen from other parts of Nicosia, so I cannot recommend it.",Shacolas Tower
30,"The panoramic view is really nice and I liked that it had a small ""room"" where you can listen to the city's history while watching a video. On the other hand there is no access for people with special needs or parents with strollers. The room was small and I believe that it gonna be easily crowded..",Shacolas Tower
30,"if you are nearby the bazaar you can visit here but in my opinion its not worth it if you just want to see this location , i suggest to visit more cultural location , this place is absolultly missable",Shacolas Tower
50,I recommend you to visit this observatory&museum in order to understand more about Lefkosia. You'll have a 360 degrees views with a map and the main buildings of the city located on it. Also a video documentary presentation of the history of Lefkosia.,Shacolas Tower
40,This was easy to find and entered via a signed entrance at the side of H & M. A lift takes you to the observatory where you pay your €2.50 entrance fee. Nicosia may not have the finest cityscape but you do get an excellent 360 degree view of the city. It is good for getting your bearings and signs help you pick out the main points of interest. There is a small presentation on the history of Nicosia and for us the photographs showing the city over the years were interesting to see.,Shacolas Tower
30,Hardly worth visiting as there really isn't that much to see at such a low level. Its only 2.50 so at this price doesn't really matter if you waste your money. No pram access!,Shacolas Tower
50,This was a great find. Really easy to locate next to the main entrance of H&M. Worth the 2.50 euro entrance fee. Great views of the city below from all 4 sides and a really informative video and info panels,Shacolas Tower
50,"The entrance is just off Ledra Street, in the H&M building. No problem with the lift up to the 11th floor, then you pay your 2.50 euros and enjoy panoramic views over Nicosia with interactive displays informing about various landmarks and a film about the history of Nicosia. It's not a huge space, but well worth the entrance fee.",Shacolas Tower
40,"It takes a little finding as you think you are in the wrong place as not very well sign posted. In the old Debenhams building (most of the travel guides still say that), now a H&M. Once you go up in the lift (it's a little bit rickety but still better than 11 flights of stairs), you will need to pay a couple of euros (2.50) to going into the exhibit and observatory.Good views of the city on both sides of the border, with key buildings and history highlighted on an inactive map in the observatory. Some really interesting facts about the history and the surrounding area including a video to watch. We got some great panoramic photographs - well worth a visit if you are interested in the town & it's history.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Up the lift to the 11th floor, pay your €2.50 & get fabulous views of the city. Good history & diagrams to assist identification. Well worth a visit. ( Next to H & M)",Shacolas Tower
50,Great view over Nicosia during day and when it is getting dark. we recommend this location to visit.,Shacolas Tower
50,"The tallest building of the city center. Here, you can observe the whole city and enjoy some quality time doing something different, watching Nicosia form above !",Shacolas Tower
10,"I have no idea why this 'attraction' gets positive feedback. The tower is not sited particularly close to the Green Line and so trying to make out even significant buildings on the Northern side takes a lot of effort.In short, there is very little to see of the division of the city and you are better off tracing the course of the Green Line on the ground which, with a little persistence, provides an extremely rewarding insight. Nicosia isn't a particularly interesting city from above so, for me, the most I got out of it was a free toilet on the floor below.True, there is a film with commentary on the history of Nicosia but it reveals nothing that you won't get from a good quality guidebook.What I particularly didnt like was that you only find out that there is a fee once you exit the elevator.My advice: avoid.",Shacolas Tower
50,"For me Shacolas tower is a must for a first visit to Nicosia. It allows literally to look around and choose places you would like to see up close. A video about history of Nicosia and Cyprus in general is really helpful, it gives you a sense of the city and explains a lot about its appearance and its vibe. Nicosia does not posses flashy beauty of popular touristic destinations. Its charm has to be unveiled slowly. Which is hard to do if you just walk Ledras and Onasagorou street. Shacolas observatory contributes to this purpose. Besides the entry ticket has a ridicuolus price of 2 or 3 euro. It's so much worth it!",Shacolas Tower
30,this is place where you can go to see the Greek part of Nicosia the green line and the occupied part.,Shacolas Tower
50,"Located on the 11th floor of H&M building(used to be Debenhams).On Ledra Str , the main shopping street in the walled city of Nicosia.About 3 minutes walk from Eleftherias sq and 10 minutes from Ledra street check point to Nothern Nicosia.Entrance from the side of the building.Elevator and steps to the 11th floor.Entrance fee €2.00 per person.Vissitor will have a 360 degree view of the whole Nicosia.Lots of explanation and you can activate touch screens will give the history and not only.You can take photos.Toilets available on the 9th floor free of charge.",Shacolas Tower
30,"Followed the signs and came across the building although at first went straight past it. Went up the lift to have a look and able to see a partial view without saying , felt that we knew enough about the troubles not to waste time here rather than spending time on the ground.",Shacolas Tower
50,I like how this observatory is so appropriately located in Nicosia. The vantage point allows one to observe this city in all directions. It highlights some key historical buildings and gives a survey of the history of Cyprus with a video. Of course this is one version of the history. Nonetheless it is a great starting point to mark out the places one might be interested to visit around Nicosia.,Shacolas Tower
30,An interesting place to learn some things about history of Cyprus and have the best view of the area.,Shacolas Tower
40,"Climb to the 11th floor (there's a lift, too) and enjoy the panoramic view over all of Nicosia (South and North).",Shacolas Tower
50,"Upon arrival in Nicosia, we headed to the observatory for a birds eye view of the city. The observatory provided 360 degree views. Nominal charge for entry.",Shacolas Tower
50,"This hidden view point is not well-known by both regulars to and locals of Nicosia. Shacolas Towers is one of the very few, or even the only, 360 degree observatory open to the public. It has interactive maps providing you with information of what you're looking at and you can also watch a short yet informative video about the history of the city. A must-see for anyone spending time in the all-famous Lidra Street!",Shacolas Tower
50,"Wonderful opportunity to see the centre of Nicosia from above, including the Turkish part of the city. Interactive screens with names and explanations, really great to get a general idea of one's whereabouts.2,50 € entry fee, money well spent.",Shacolas Tower
50,This tower gives you spectacular views of the divided city of Nicosia. Well worth the visit. It also clearly shows sadly the dividing line between the Turkish and Greek occupied territory.,Shacolas Tower
50,I went up the observatory based on Tripadvisor recommendations. It was really good to get an overview of the city and the main buildings to get your bearings as when down in the streets you can become disoriented.The displays and information is good and it only costs 2.50 EUR so bargain!,Shacolas Tower
30,"Good place to go to get an idea of the overall town layout. The lift frightened us. We got in, alol the lights went out and we were left in total darkness. Couldn't even see where the alarm button was or even if there was one. Fortunately everything came back to life again after a few uncomfortable minutes. It was one of those rare occasions on which a smoker might have been of some use. He or she might have had a lighter.",Shacolas Tower
50,Head for the 11th floor stairs or lift it's up to you!!😎2.50 euro entry to the viewing floor. Gift shop and drinks machine . Loos on the 9th floor. Fantastic views from several large windows. Screens in front of you to help you zoom in on points of interest. In the distance you can see the Turkish Cypriot flag emblazoned on the mountain side. There is central booth which recounts the story of Cypriot history.,Shacolas Tower
50,This is a wonderful chance to get high above Nicosia to see what's on the ground level on both the Southern and Northern sides of the checkpoint. You find this observation gallery on the eleventh floor of the H&M building in town and with an entry fee of just 2 euros and 50 cents it is worth every cent. The northern side is particularly spectacular with it's mountain backdrops. Unfortunately my trip was slightly marred by an overbearing jobs worth who kept moaning about the windows being opened when taking photos.,Shacolas Tower
30,This Tower Museum is the main tower located in the heart of Nicosia which is within the Commercial District area. You could see a great view of the city from the top deck.,Shacolas Tower
50,in the mid of the old city one of the only odbervatory points down ledra street-free entrance -culture,Shacolas Tower
30,"At the the tower you get what you expect, a good panorama view of the city.It isn't the prettiest of cities to look down upon, both trying to make out the green line and see differences between the two parts of the city was interesting.",Shacolas Tower
40,Great to see all of Nicosia and brush up on some historical elements. I am local and always take visitors there!,Shacolas Tower
50,A small observation deck gives you a brilliant all-round view of what is otherwise a pretty low-rise city. There are panoramic photographs and interactive screens which give you an idea of where the main landmarks are located and a bit about them - this is helpful in planning which ones to see. There is a short video presentation which gives you a brief overview of the history of the city and you are able to borrow binoculars to look at the remnants of the invasion - such as bullet holes in buildings on the green line. The small entry fee is more than worth it. Children will enjoy pushing buttons if nothing else and there is a small gift shop as well.NOTE - If you are coming here on the recommendation of a guide book - it is now located above H&M and NOT DEBENHAMS - their new store is well out of the old city!,Shacolas Tower
40,Only takes 30 minutes maximum but worth it to orientate yourself in Nicosia. Has 360 views out over the city and explanatory notes on key landmarks and buildings. There's an 8 minute film about the history of Nicosia which was really interesting. Only cost 2.50euro but worth it. It's easy to find- just off Ledra Street- go straight in and take the lift to the top floor.,Shacolas Tower
40,"The observatory is a very nice place to go to when visiting Lefkosia. Going in, there are wonderful drawings hanging on the wall of maps of the streets around. Very cute. To get up top you go up in a lift, and then you have to pay to get into the little museum and observatory area. The small museum is dedicated to Lefkosia's history, and full of interactive screens. The view from here is absolutely amazing, and one can see all side of Lefkosia from here. And the Turkish bit. Great visit!",Shacolas Tower
50,"This is the place to visit if you want to see the whole of Nicosia. It is interesting to see the old and new. There is a lot of information available regarding the places you can see from there, and a small room to watch an interesting video. Adults find it very interesting, my four-year-old was mesmerised.",Shacolas Tower
50,"The museum was lovely - simply explaining the history of Nicosia and telling you about everything that you could see from the observatory. The person who worked there brought me binoculars so I could have a closer look through the glass. I went really early, as there were staff still cleaning the floors, but that was my fault!",Shacolas Tower
50,Great spot to view the whole city of Nicosia from the top floor of Shacolas Building. Offers a spherical view of the city of Nicosia as far as the eye can see along with historical data of the city.,Shacolas Tower
50,"This is a great experience for 2.50 Euro each, you go in a lift to the viewing platform and you can see everything. It was 45 degrees when we went so there was a heat haze so distance view was not great. There is a cinema area showing a film about the history. Just find H+M on Ledra Street and the lift is at the side.",Shacolas Tower
40,"If you've never been to Nicosia, or if you've never been up the Tower, this is definitely worth a look.You get a great 360 degree views over the city and surrounding hills. There are information boards so you know what you're looking at, with explanations about how the city has been shaped and affected by conflict.Entrance is a couple of Euros so is great value for money.",Shacolas Tower
50,Very easy to find and a real must do tourist activity. It's very modern inside and the displays are great. The tower used to be at the top of Debenhams but it is now H&M so don't worry if your guidebook points you in the direction of Debenhams.,Shacolas Tower
50,"For a very moderate fee Eur 2,50 you can visit the museum and go to the observatory. A real must once in Nicosia, let you understand the history of this tiny island since the beginning.",Shacolas Tower
20,Just see the City of Nicosia from a tall building. As far as i remember there is nothing else to offer.,Shacolas Tower
40,Located in the center of Nicosia. The tall tower offers a panoramic view of the capital. There are drinks and refreshments.,Shacolas Tower
40,"For only €2.50 you can visit the panoramic viewing room at the the top of the tower which gives a great view of Nicosia, both sides of the dividing line, each window has multi-language touch screens that provide a detailed explanation for all of the main buildings and points of interest around the city, gives you a great appreciation of the city layout that you can't get from ground level.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Nicosia is a divided EU capital city! It is worth going up the observatory tower to have a panoramic overview of the city and to study the division line. Information screen-windows give you description of buildings and churches to be seen and in the distance one can see the Turkish Cypriotic flag displayed on the mountain. There is a film about the Nicosia history and a small souvenir shop. Elevator brings you up the 11th floor, airco, clean and free comfort zone ( toilets ). Worth seeing and only for the price of 2,5 euro. For the ones that love ancient and modern history it is a must see.",Shacolas Tower
50,We decided to pop up the observatory to get views of ALL the city as its has 360dg views also has pointers identifying key sites also has a film playing on loop of the history of Nicosia,Shacolas Tower
40,"Small museum with panoramic view on 11th floor of tower. A bit of history where you can see main dates and facts about Cyprus. You have view from tower over to the verge of city with all cathedrals and buildings. In front of each panoramic screen-window there is a small description what are you looking at... Price is 2,50 a bit too much for this... You can maximum spend 30 min there if you really interested...",Shacolas Tower
40,This is an excellent way to understand the layout of the old town of Nicosia - well worth the entrance fee.,Shacolas Tower
50,"It is very interesting to visit this tower as it gives you the opportunity to learn about the long and interesting history of Nicosia and to compare the old and the new building architecture, while you wonder why in the 21st century a capital city of a European country is still divided with the presence of an army.",Shacolas Tower
40,A spot everyone should visit at least once in their lifetimes. The view is fantastic and a rare one as there aren't many spots of this height and this type of location in Nicosia.,Shacolas Tower
50,An excellent way to view the city and learn about the history of how and why Nicosia became divided. Learn how what is called the Green Line came about.,Shacolas Tower
50,"The building has previously housed a Woolworths and a Debenhams. It now houses a H&M fashion store.Pros:-Two lifts.-Helpful member of staff.-9 minute introductory video of history of Nicosia.-Touchscreens and information boards highlighting the main sites.-Photos of old Nicosia.-Small gift shop - postcards, maps on 9th floor.-Toilets on 9th floor.Cons:-None.",Shacolas Tower
40,"The interactive displays are very good. What strikes one most is the disparity between the Greek and Turkish parts of the city, the latter lacking the modern investment which the Greek side has attracted.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Went here 2017, great place to visit. Would recommend because if u want to see the city all in one go then this is a must, views are good and most impress with the flag on the mountain side, Cyprus and Turkey has there past and can clearly be seen from the tower how the buildings are totally different on each side really something",Shacolas Tower
50,"A must when visiting Nicosia as it allows you to witness the city (both sides) from up high and gives you a unique birds eye view. Also, the video, interactive touch screens and information banners at this attraction really helps one understand the city and its magnificent history. It is not free, but definitely worth it.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Really nice informative video where you can learn a lot more about Cyprus (video length around 10 minutes). As you walk around the windows, you see different areas of Nicosia. The one that struck me the most was the one where you see the Turkish flag on the hills far away. Good for orientation as well. Highly recommended and worth the 5 euros entrance fee.",Shacolas Tower
50,A great opportunity to have a panoramic view of the city (both sides) and the video about Cyprus' history is very informative,Shacolas Tower
40,Nice to have this tower to see the divided city but with a Sad reality of what has happened to Cyprus.,Shacolas Tower
50,Easy to access for a small fee and well worth it for excellent 360 degree views across and around the city. A few more photos and exhibits inside along with a small shop. Easily reached just of the main drag.,Shacolas Tower
20,"Not worth the price. Better to cross the green line and just be on the other side. Maybe before when no crossings to the north were allowed it was worth a look, but for me not now. Just a tip, free toilet room access on the 4th floor where windows allows you to check the north side!",Shacolas Tower
40,for those who want to have a birds eye view of occupied nicosia a good place to visit. equipped with multi language facilities it provides an interesting insight into the history of nicosia within the walls and its old buildings. a very interesting sight especially for foreign visitors.,Shacolas Tower
40,We paid €5 to go into the tower. There's historical references and photographs of the post 1974 Turkish occupation of Cyprus. Sad to see such a beautiful country destroyed as the pre 1974 photographs show this.,Shacolas Tower
50,"The observation floor is all indoor, but the attendant kindly opened a number of wondows to let us have a clear view on the city. There are a number of interactive displays highlighting points and buildings of interest with the associated history. Well worth a visit.",Shacolas Tower
30,"I was looking forward to getting a birds eye view of Nicosia and the surroundings but unfrotunately Shacolas tower was a bit of a let-down. It really wasn't anything special, just a room on the 11th floor with a teeny tiny museum (really just a few stands and a couple of photos) attached to it. There are windows all around so you can look at all four directions (and it's particularly interesting to see the Northern side with the massive Northern Cyprus flag etched on a hillside) but there's no outside viewing platform so it's a bit of an anticlimax really. Still, it only costs you 2.50 to get in, so if you're all about the views, it will do just fine...",Shacolas Tower
40,"This is on the 11th floor, It gives you access to have a birds eye view of Nicosia. From here one can observe the way of life these Cypriots live",Shacolas Tower
40,"The tower offers a nice view of the city from all directions, there are pictures below the windows with explanations about the most important buildings. It would have been nice to be able to go out on the terrace and enjoy the views in the open air.",Shacolas Tower
40,"It is worth to go up and have a panorama of the whole city. There is a nice display with the things you can observe, with panels in many languages. It is worth the visit.",Shacolas Tower
40,"The height of the tower allows for vies in 360 degrees, all over the city. an interactive guide in the room gives brief information about sights. A nice visit for both locals and tourists.",Shacolas Tower
40,"The observatory deck is at the 11th floor and it offers some nice circular views of the city below in addition to the Turkish region. There are some interactive screens with info about the attractions that appear through the windows. Also, the wall in the middle of the room offers some chronological history of the city of Nicosia. It would have been nice if there was an outside deck.",Shacolas Tower
50,The 360° view of the city at the 11th floor is really nice. You can see both greek and turkish sides.The explanations of buildings are well detailed.,Shacolas Tower
50,Great 360 view of the city of Nicosia (free or occupied) with maps and information about the most important buildings. Watch a 10 ten minutes video with the story of Nicosia.,Shacolas Tower
50,The views around nicosia just breathtaking and stunning. Worth going to and one of the highlights of my day.,Shacolas Tower
40,I always take my foreign guests to the observatory from where they get a well signposted and real view of the tragedy of the last dividedcity in Europe and probably the world,Shacolas Tower
30,"I would say that of many observatories that i visited, this particular one needs update. It has great almost 360 degrees views but it lacks information on history since you can view the occupied part of the city...",Shacolas Tower
50,Great views of Nicosia - particularly over the border crossingAirconditionedGreat salad barNearby shops and amenities so good respite place,Shacolas Tower
40,"In addition to be great for the amazing view of Nicosia, the museum gives a nice overview of the history of the city.",Shacolas Tower
20,"You pay 2.5 Euro to see a 5 minute video about Cyprus, then you can look out the windows at the city and get a little bit of information about the city. Do not expect too much as there isn't much to see.All in all it was interesting to get a visual reference of a few of the good tourist points to visit but nothing else.As they say... you get what you pay for (even if it might seem too much).",Shacolas Tower
50,It is the last floor of a building in old Nicosia and you can have a panoramic view of Nicosia all around !,Shacolas Tower
50,The tower museum and observatory offers a great panoramic view of the divided city of Nicosia. You can see sights on both sides of the green line and for a moment you can imagine just what it was like when the city was united. Apart from this there is a very good presentation of the city's history. A very nice experience altogether.,Shacolas Tower
50,"Went on a cloudless December day. Super views across the buffer zone, into Turkey and all around Nicosia. The information there was really helpful and insightful for planning the rest of the trip across the Ledra Street crossing.",Shacolas Tower
40,A good attraction to visit whilst u r in Nicosia! More advertising needed cause noticed that the capital of Cyprus is not so well known to tourists !,Shacolas Tower
40,If you are in Nicosia you must see the view from the top of the observatory at 2-50 euro pp it is good value though there is nothing sophisticated about it take your camera and it will be around 20 minutes to see all.,Shacolas Tower
40,"I have taken visitors from abroad to the Observatory on more than one occassion, as it gives a unique perspective tot he last divided capital - Nicosia. It gives a bird view of old Nicosia on both sides of the divide, and a brief historical review.",Shacolas Tower
50,A really exciting way to view Nicosia City. The views allows you to see all the way onto the Nothern side of Cyprus.,Shacolas Tower
50,At this building you will find history. Build-ed in the center of Ledra street through times has hosted big clothing shops etc.But on the side you climb on the last floor and you see the observatory.There you can see from a higher view point the Turkish occupied area of Nicosia with a history interaction.,Shacolas Tower
50,This observation tower is very close to ledra street crossing border. The first thing which struck my interest was the flag on the northern part of Nicosia.Obviously from this location acroos the 4 corners of the city centre,Shacolas Tower
40,Since I first started the review Debenhams store has closed down and another store has taken over the building. I do not know if you are still allowed to go to the viewing area.,Shacolas Tower
50,"We love visiting Shacolas observatory as family of 2 adults & 3 children aged 10, 8 & 2 and have been a few times.It looks down over the entire city and has views from every angle! The children love the fact that they are so high up & enjoy pointing out different places. There are interactive screens at each viewing point & you can choose your preferred language and look up the different sights around the city and it provides you with information on each one. There are binoculars available at the check in desk and you can see for miles around each part of Nicosia & beyond. There are old photographs on display showing the area from years gone by and there is also a documentary on show too. There is a small gift shop there for picking up souvenirs. It cost €2 per adult & children are free.If you are in Nicosia with small children & want to do some sightseeing then Shacolas is a great alternative than traipsing young ones around each sight!",Shacolas Tower
50,"Great place to see and view the whole of Nicosia. And if the weather is good, which is 365 days a year you can see even further.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Part of a trip to Nicosia having already been to the Turkish side. This enables one to get a ""bird's"" eye view of the City and unfortunately see the ""divide"".",Shacolas Tower
30,You get a good all around view of the city and some touch screens explain the sights. It's a bit small and you need to look through windows. It would have been nice if it was open air and a bit more spacious. But definitely worth a visit.,Shacolas Tower
40,it's a nice view from above and it's only 2E the entrancethey also put a short movie about the history of cyprustoo bad there are glass windows all over the place and they don't let you open them,Shacolas Tower
50,The entrance to the shacolas building is next to H&M. Take the elevator to the 11 th floor observatory for a panoramic unhindered view of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish occupied portion of this divided city. I strongly recommend visiting here before walking over to the Turkish occupied part of the city . There are interactive exhibits with touch screens which provide explanations (in several languages) about the history of the main monuments on both sides of Lefkosia. You can also see the enormous flag which the Turks painted on the mountain as a provocation. There is an entrance fee of 2€. You will spend about 20 minutes here in the air conditioned room .,Shacolas Tower
50,"The observatory offers outstanding views of all of Nicosia. It highlights the division of the city, with the contrasting national flags either side of the Green Line. The must see sights of the old city are clearly visible and an outline history of each is given. At ground level the city is sometimes difficult to piece together. A visit here resolves this problem. The provocative Turkish flag on the hills north of Nicosia is clearly visible. A useful audio visual provides a basic history of Cyprus and Nicosia.",Shacolas Tower
30,"Although on the 11th floor of the tallest building in the vicinity, Nicosia offers neither breathtaking views nor any really exceptional architectural significance. Yes, some history is recited on tape, and in several languages, and yes, there are binoculars to view any details of the buildings by one's own preference. No, nowhere near as much as any picturesque/historic European capital or even just an architecturally uniform one or just green... And that doesn't reflect the relatively rich history of the place which is deliberately and conveniently obliterated in its entirety, with mere references to more important areas, while stressing useless and trivial dates and times... Not worth it really. You can get all the references and history with professional photography to back it up online. I'm sorry to say that Google in this case seems to be a richer experience.",Shacolas Tower
50,Amazing view of the city .Both old and new parts are nice to watch.Historical importance also mentioned.Over all must do activity !!!,Shacolas Tower
50,worth visiting when walking down Ledra street. Top of Debenham's building. Over looks the city right across the Turkish sector. Some good views and articles about certain places can be read from the tower. Just below is a restaurant should you feel like a bite to eat.!!,Shacolas Tower
10,We attempted to visit the observatory last Friday. H&M are moving in on the ground floor and the entrance to observatory was blocked and signage invisible. We enquired from work men and they said it was open.We went through the dark ground floor lobby and got into the lift which informed us that the museum was closed as there was a power cut after we had pushed the 9(??) floor button. We got out on 9th floor and there was signage saying it was closed for lunch. Grrrrrr to say the least,Shacolas Tower
50,"The tower offers an excellent panoramic view of the entire city, including the Turkish part of Cyprus. Staff kindly provided us with binoculars. There is an interactive multi-language dashboard and small museum. You can also buy souvenirs here.",Shacolas Tower
40,A 360 view of the city and its districts. You can enjoy an even better view and get binoculars from the ticket store. There is also a short description of each area in the map so that the viewer can understand the history behind certain areas and landmarks.,Shacolas Tower
30,I didn't feel there was much to see in terms of the buffer zone or check points or history.Good value at €2 each.Worth taking a look for the view but the building was under redevelopment so no cafe and lots of scaffolding at the entrance.Toilets and air conditioning,Shacolas Tower
40,It is a worth visiting museum if you want to have a complete view of the whole city of Nicosia with a low priced ticket,Shacolas Tower
50,"If you really want to see the city, that's the right place. You can see the monuments and how the two sides are divided due to the panoramic view. Also, it's helpful as u can find the places you want to visit. I strongly recommend it!",Shacolas Tower
40,"This is a good place to start to get your bearings in Nicosia, take some landscape photos, and learn a little of the history of Cyprus from the short (under 10 minute) video. There is a nominal entrance fee but it is very much worth it.",Shacolas Tower
40,Bang in the centre of the Cypriot old town and main modern centre of shops and cafes its perfectly located to get a good vantage point over the city.€2 per ticket.,Shacolas Tower
40,"Panoramic view of the city, where you can realise its divided reality. There is always a short but very comprehensive video to understand this storming history... Very interesting!",Shacolas Tower
40,"Worth the time (and the minimal admission price). You can see most of the city and many of the key sites. It is particularly useful to visit at the start of your visit to Nicosia. Unfortunately, the hours are rather limited. It would be wonderful to be able to watch the sunset from the observatory.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Shacolas Tower provides you with a good overview of the city. The panorama is well explained by interactive terminals. The video on Nicosia's history is very concise and comprehensive. Without an open-air panorama, the 2 Euro entrance fee however seems a bit steep.",Shacolas Tower
40,The lift of the observatory takes you to a magnificent viewpoint from where you can see most of Nicosia and far beyond. On that top level there are sufficient well document options to explain what you are looking at.,Shacolas Tower
50,"If you are not sure what to visit in Nicosia, this place will help you. Nice views, interesting and helpful guide on the touchscreens. Ticket is only 2 euros. Selimiye Mosque looks really nice here.",Shacolas Tower
50,"This is the only way to start planning what to see in this fantastic city. Even the tourist maps from the tourism office don't get it this good! In fact the whole of Cyprus could do with a visit by Google maps or a good cartographer!! This ensured we planned our walk about and it was soooo interesting. Yes the receptionist was more interested in her book than us and yes the AV system was a bit hit and miss but, make a plan from here and you won't be disappointed.",Shacolas Tower
50,"For 2€ you get to see a 360° view of Nicosia, with some explanations about monuments. There is also a short video about the history of Nicosia.I would totally recommand to do this.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Located in the tallest building in the old part of Nicosia, the Shacolas Tower (or Ledra Observatory as it is locally known) provides the best views of Nicosia. You get to see all the landmarks in the old part and new parts of the city, and get information on what you are seeing with the electronic information boards present. There is also a small area where you can watch a 15 minute documentary about the history of Nicosia. I strongly recommend it! (Approx time to spend: 45 mins).",Shacolas Tower
40,This building is at the side of what will be an H & M store (replacing Debenhams). It is open although the building work makes it easy to miss the entrance. Found the video very informative and learnt a lot about the overall history. The views are really amazing and they give you a good bearing to find places you wish to visit later on either side of the crossing points.Staff very helpful and friendly.,Shacolas Tower
50,For the two euro enterance fee its well worth taking the lift to the top.You can see all of nicosia in all directions.The only blot on the landscape is the huge turkish flag painted on the mountain.,Shacolas Tower
40,"The 2 Euro basically buys you a panoramic view of the city, plus a video of the history of the city. If that sounds good to you, then you should go.The video was disappointing, in that the headphones either had no sound at all or were blasting so loud I had to hold them a few inches from my ear to avoid being deafened. Also, the video has a music soundtrack so loud that it often drowns out the narrator. Seemed like a 1990-era documentary.",Shacolas Tower
30,Fantastic views of all sides of the city and makes a great photo when photographing the North to the mountains. The whole history of the city is explained at the top but if you're not interested in that then it's probably not for you! Costs €2 to get in so you're hardly paying much.,Shacolas Tower
50,"If you don't have time to enter the Turkish part of Nicosia, then a visit to the Shacolas Tower will allow you to see some of the key buildings!The 2€ entrance fee also includes a short audiovideo which provides a brief history of this fascinating city!",Shacolas Tower
40,"Seemed to be really good but there were signs that it wasn't looking to smart since the building is no longer being occupied. Views good, historical video was good too. Probably takes about 30-40 min",Shacolas Tower
40,a must visit when in Nicosia. you get an amazing view of the city and you can see all its landmarks. A MUST!!!!,Shacolas Tower
50,"An excellent place to relax after a busy day or with friends to have a discussion in a quiet place. A comfortable, clean and cheap cafe, quality in everything offered, but above all the amazing, astonishing view of Nicosia towards all the points of the horizon, from Pentadaktylos to Troodos with the ability to pinpoint almost every sightseeing or historical monument of the capital. From there you get the feeling of Nicosia at it's historical eras.",Shacolas Tower
40,"First it was quite hard to find the right building but as the place was found, there was easy to find the tower. Good view to take a look of the every side of Nikosia. The tower hasn't too large and also not too small. We liked this.",Shacolas Tower
40,The lift takes you quickly up to the 11th floor of the tower. A small charge of €2 is paid as you enter the observation area. The are large windows round the 360 degree panoramic view of the city. There are headphones and an area where a video can be watched plus historical pictures around the walls. For maximum benefit this is best visited on a clear day. There is a small souvenir area.,Shacolas Tower
50,"Just €2 and there's a lift (elevator)! You can't go wrong, can you? And added to the views there is a 10-minute video about the history of the city (not just post-1974 - it goes back to Ancient times). The young lady on duty was very helpful and pleasant. And there's a free toilet (on the ninth floor).",Shacolas Tower
50,360degree view of city and surrounding area - go early morning or as the sun is setting as the air quality can be hazy at most times of year. The primary reason for this weird lookout tower is/was to look over into the Turkish North. But the views are great anyway. There are also historic photos of Nicosia as it was. Cheap.,Shacolas Tower
40,"I regularly come here to enjoy the view of Nicosia, from here you can observe most of the downtown.Recently this place was updated and now includes some interactive screens, showing you historical facts about surroundings.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Really, you must visit the museum to see the only divided city in the world. You can see the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot from the top of the observatory. Come during late afternoon where the lights of both parts of the city were all lighting up. It was beautiful scenery! A recommended for all visiting Nicosia.",Shacolas Tower
40,"If you are a first time visitor to Nicosia and you have just arrived at the ""divided city"" visiting Shacolas Tower Museum & Observatory is the first thing you have to do. Seeing and taking photos of Nicosia from the top makes you understand the topography of the buffer zone. Keep in mind that there is a ticket of 2€ per person.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Fascinating views over both the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot parts of the city. Some good historical photographs in the observatory. This is on the 11th floor, there is a lift.",Shacolas Tower
50,"It is nice to be in the tower and have the opportunity to see the city United as a whole, across each side. It seems that was never separated.",Shacolas Tower
50,"From this vantage point, you can see Nicosia within the walls as you've never seen it before. Worth the visit.",Shacolas Tower
40,The eleventh floor of this building has a near 360 degree lookout on all of Nicosia City. Well worth the one euro fee. Lift goes right up. Large touch screen computers identify key landmarks. Brief video of history of Nicosia and a few photos and timeline. Go here as soon as you get to the old city.,Shacolas Tower
40,"A place definitely worth visiting when in Nicosia, as it gives a different view of the old city and beyond. I think it's probably more interesting if you have already walked around a bit so you can recognise different spots from a different perspective.",Shacolas Tower
30,Expected it would be better but that's fine only a couple euros I think If like a view then don't miss it You can have a coffee n snack up there to Nice shop go through to get there Easy to find on Ledra Street,Shacolas Tower
40,On my last morning in Nicosia I ventured up to the observatory. It is great for getting an overview of the city with clear views of the Turkish side.Well worth it!,Shacolas Tower
40,"You can overview Nicosia and the northern part of cyprus on the tower. There is information broad telling you some of the famous landscapes (not many). Basically, this is the only thing to do in Nicosia.",Shacolas Tower
50,"The tower is located on Ledras street, at the heart of the divided city of Nicosia. You can clearly see the division line across the city from here. Spent a very informative hour here, took lots of beautiful pictures. Very worth visiting",Shacolas Tower
50,Top of Debenhams have a coffee then take life up again to this wonderful viewpoint and see North and South Cyprus.,Shacolas Tower
40,"Take the elevator to the 11th floor, pay 2€ and enjoy the view. Screens are available with explanatory information over the town. You can also have a clear view on the flags displayed on the mountains by the north...",Shacolas Tower
30,"I was in between 'poor' and 'average' but I went for the mid-point because I think the place has potential. It's a good view point of the city, in fact, especially the Old part of the capital (where it is located). It is a place where you can see both the Free and Turkish-Occupied parts without 'crossing-over' to the other side so not only interesting for the tourists but also for Cypriots on the south part of Cyprus that want to have a glance of their city of places in the city -within-the walls- they haven't been to yet or do not have access to.What we liked best was the maps/simulations that you can use to locate and identify the buildings and neighborhoods -you are actually viewing at the observatory in real-time. The videos on the history of Cyprus were informative but quite outdated! I guess they did them once back in the 90's and never updated them.Overall the place just had an old-fashion vibe, also it was not very clean - it would be nice to see it upgraded and I maybe add some more modern and more interesting videos on Cyprus especially for younger visitors.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Going there is not just a shopping experience, but also an opportunity to see the North of Cyprus, especially people who for various reasons cannot cross.",Shacolas Tower
30,"Nice overview over the walled city. Explanation screens, with short info. Info film is breathless, the partly interesting images do not always fit to the explanation.Missing is an explanation of the different phases of the division of the city.Missing is a guided tour explaining the situation and telling stories about the division. Missing as well are ideas for the future. The museum and observatory can not deliver a serious explanation.",Shacolas Tower
30,The view is not what you expect. Definitely it could have been even better. Disappointed about this.,Shacolas Tower
50,The best view of the old city with ample interactive maps of buildings and landmarks. There is an informative audiovisual presentation (in several languages) that takes you through the history and stages of construction of the walled city. Well worth the visit. I have done it several times now and always learn more. Interesting old photos on the wall display. Small entry fee.,Shacolas Tower
50,"Take a walk down Ledra street on the Greek side (From the bus station) and half way down on the right you will find Debenhams - at the side of the building to the right (Or off the top floor of the restaurant) you find the entrance to the elevator up to the top floor.2 euros to get in, and we were offered binoculars to look over into the Turkish side of the fence plus interactive computers that you can zoom in to the different buildings.There is also a small video presentation.Certainly one of the tallest buildings in Nicosia the view all around is fantastic - this must be top of everyone's to do list, as you can see all the ancient buildings on the Turkish side, and it was this viewing point that pushed us into taking the time to cross over the border.Needs to be on everyone's must do list, though if I had a criticism as a photographer I would have liked to have been allowed outside to take photos - but hey ho - I have some great shots through the glass.",Shacolas Tower
50,Small fee but well worth it. The view is great and location are well explained. I liked the experience,Shacolas Tower
40,"Every tourist visiting the historic centre of Nicosia should clime 11th floor in the pedestrian area up to the observatory of the Shiakolas building, to get to know Nicosia (both sides) easily and quickly.",Shacolas Tower
30,+Short film on the history of the city+Most of the attractions can be seen up there+Air-conditioned+Cheap-Toilet and caffee shop are on different floors,Shacolas Tower
50,"The Shacolas Tower observatory is not very easy to find - unless you know it is at the top of Debenhams in Ledra Street! We went into Debenhams's and the sales assistant told us that we had to enter the Shacolas Tower around the side of the shop, after that, it was easy. A lift takes you up to the 11th floor and for 2 Euros, there is a panoramic view across the whole of Nicosia. It is a very good way to orientate yourself as there are interactive maps with explanations in a varierty of languages where you can click on to the pictures and identify the many buildings by the use of touch screens.",Shacolas Tower
50,It is really amamzing view from there. You could see all the city - both parts (the Southern one and the Northern one) with their beautiful buildings. You could see the mountain as well where two flags (the Turkish one and the one of the Northern Cyprus) were created by coloured stones.,Shacolas Tower
40,"On the 13th floor in a tower just around the corner of Ledras street you can see stunning views of the city. Important landmarks are shown on interactive maps with explanation in several languages. You can see the Turkish part of the city as well, with their flag and mosques etc. Good pictures can be taken from there.",Shacolas Tower
40,"A nice view of the city, and well explained with interactive screens and maps. Some amusing post-cards for sale in the shop as well. At first we did as some people recommended and went to the 6th floor coffee shop, but honestly, the view is not the same, so we went all the way up. While a view from the top is 2EUR, it is worth it.",Shacolas Tower
40,"If you want to peer over the Buffer Zone into northern Cyprus, you can do it through visiting this eleven-storey Shacolas Tower.A fine aerial photo of the city provides orientation.Mind you, the first five floors are occupied by Debenhams and on the 6th floor it is a cafeteria.There is a separate entrance to reach the observatory and not through the department where you are asked to pay a small fee.The day I was here it was not a clear day though and neither were the windows. For this reason I was not able to take photos!",Shacolas Tower
50,"There is not much you can really say about this, but I would say it is a must do when coming to visit the Capital. You get to see an excellent view and one you cannot get anywhere else as high up locally, that I know of. Just give it a go and view as far as the eye can see, it will not be an event, as it is something that does not take long but still it is worth it.",Shacolas Tower
30,"For 2E per person this is a reasonable way to spend an hour of your day. The city is not easily viewable from above, neither is it attractive to look at it, its best to get down in to the streets, but its great to get a birds eye view and learn about the history of the city.",Shacolas Tower
40,The only place I know of that you can observe all of Nicosia from above. If you find yourself in old part of the city you might as well visit. shame it only works during the daytime.,Shacolas Tower
50,"Had the luck of taking two groups of colleagues from abroad, for a Nicosia within the walls tour. This was a must stop at the beginning for many reasons:First: It's right beside the green line and that makes it the most central viewpoint to see the old town, both sides of it.Second: It gives you perspective, as to which monument you visit next is where.Third: The interactive displays fill in the blanks on many of the monuments and in various languages. You can only translate so much and not everybody speaks English or Greek so they can understand you.Fourth: You can see the tower from almost everywhere in the old town, so you are never lost.Price is not too much for what it is.",Shacolas Tower
50,We visited the Shacolas Tower which is just next to the Debenhams on Ledra Street.The tower is 11 floors up overlooking the Nicosia suburbia. There is great views of the occupied Northern area of Cyprus towards Kyrenia and around the surrounding old city walls.There is an enlightening video show with headphones provided which gives you an insight into some of Old Nicosia and the previous rulers through the ages. Finishing with Turkish invasion of the divided city and what has happened to the area now.Great video with lots of info and spectacular views give this a thumbs up. Check it out.,Shacolas Tower
40,"This is a brilliant way to orientate oneself about the geographical layout and historical background of Lefkosia.A quick tip. Access to the observatory is not by way of the Debenhams store, but via an entry on the side road to the right of the store as you look at it. From there a lift takes you up 11 floors to the observatory where entrance is via a small door. Entry fee is €2 though children are free.The observatory, though to call it a museum is slightly ambitious, is brilliant and a great opportunity to see all four sides of the city. The tower is a few hundred metres from the Ledra street crossing and so gives a particularly good view of the occupied North of the city.There are interactive displays which can be viewed in a number of different languages and tell the history and background of the buildings that can be seen.There is also a timeline through which you can follow the development of the city and the historical issues which have led to it being divided. This could have been slightly more detailed.There is also a small video displays which seats about 5 people which takes the viewer though events in the city's development.A small gift shop sells generic Cypriot gifts, but sadly lacks a selection of good historical books about the city and its history's which would sell well were they stocked.The attendant on duty when we visited on a Saturday morning was very friendly and welcoming.Thoroughly recommended. A must for anyone wanting to get a better feel for this beautiful unique city.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Knew more about Cyprus and the island's history! Beautiful panoramic view from Shacolas tower! :)Located in the center of Nicosia, the capital at Ledras Street above Debenhams with only 2€/person.",Shacolas Tower
40,"This should be the first thing to do in Nicosia, the last divided capital. The Shacolas tower is the highest building, so from it's 11th floor observatory you'll get a glimpse of it.There are interactive screens on every 4 sides, so you can learn what interests you and spot where it is situated.Looking at the north side, a huge Turkish flag carved in the mountain catches your eye.",Shacolas Tower
30,"A nice view of Nicosia, nothing special but it will worth it if you are interested to learn some historical details about Nicosia and some of the old buildings!! I have also watched a ten minute documentary video about the history of Nicosia recommended for tourists and kids who want to learn more about Nicosia..",Shacolas Tower
40,Located on top of debenhams on ledra street. One of the highest buildings in nicosia offers great views across...the rooftops of the surrounding area across to the occupied side. Perhaps was of more interest when you couldn't grab your passport and wander across to the occupied side to see things for yourself.,Shacolas Tower
50,"We started off here based on the recommendation of other reviewers. I am glad that we did as it really was the place to start. There was a small fee, equivalent to a coffee back home, between the six of us. The views are panoramic and you can take photos. You can clearly see all the buildings of interest and plan where you want to go with the help of the interactive displays which were excellent. The attendant also gave us binoculars to use free of charge. There is a short video explaining thr history of the city. Fascinating. Refuel in the Debenhams cafe afterwards as you get a voucher for 20% off.",Shacolas Tower
50,"If don't have tour guide with you and don't like to be part of the turist crowd- this is the place you can get all info you need. Get into Debenhams, take elevator, get off on 6th floor, go through restaurant take another elevator and press 11. You will find yourself infront of the small museum (entrance fee 2eur) from where you can enjoy 360 deg view of Leukosia. It gives you brief info of all the points of intetests in both sides of the city. You also get coupon of -20% discount in café on 6th floor where you will find toilet facilities, too.",Shacolas Tower
30,Not a very high observatory but you can see the entire city of Nicosia. It is a modern up to date place and provides a lot of info of the city. Entrance was only 2€. I found it a great place to start my exploration of the city.,Shacolas Tower
30,Its good to get up high and see the city from above and given that it is free its worth doing but don't go up expecting much of a museum.,Shacolas Tower
30,"An interesting place to visit, if you re visiting Nicosia for the first time. From the topmost part of the tower you can have interesting 360 view of the town laying at your feet. You can see both the older parts of Nicosia and the modern ones. There maps and photos in front of every point of view, guiding you and explaining which are the most important buildings in each section, even tough last time we ve been there with friends, we noticed that the maps were kind of old and not as easily readable. However, this was some time back, perhaps in the meantime they have done something about it. all in all, it is as interesting as other high points offering vistas of towns around Europe (ie Frankfurt, Brussels, Thessaloniki, Alcala De Henares, you name it ..) , and you could expect similar amounts of .. excitement. The cafeteria on the floor just below is something you could pass, and instead enjoy better quality of beverage and bites to eat in the pedestrian street below.",Shacolas Tower
20,"If you are really interested in seeing the north side of Nicosia, take your passport to the Ledra Street crossing and look atr it from there. Otherwise, Nicosia is a not particularly visually interesting city, and you are better off saving E2.Tip - Go to the coffee shop and you get just as good a view for free........",Shacolas Tower
40,For €2 per head ride the lift to the 11th floor and gain entrance to the Observatory. Well presented interactive information boards provide detail on some of the buildings in sight and allow you to orientate yourself if you want to go wandering at ground level.Views over the whole city and as far as the mountains beyond which lies the coast and Kyrenia. Interesting short film explaining things about Nicosia shown in the tiny cinema. This has 4 sets of headphones through which you can hear the presentation in English. Worth a visit and good value.,Shacolas Tower
40,Take the direct lift to the 11th floor of the tower above Debenhams from the separate entrance just off Ledra Street and for 2 euros there is an amazing panoramic view over the divided capitol of Nicosia. On a clear day you can see for miles. Interactive boards highlight places of interest and a multi language audio visual presentation explains the history of the city. Informative and well worth a visit.,Shacolas Tower
50,"This is the best (only?) place to enjoy a panoramic view of Nicosia. The information panels are very helpful. Don't miss the short video in the central booth. Room for around 5 - headphones in a number of languages.Good value at 2 Eur entry.The elevator saves climbing 11 storeys. However, there are stairs for the more energetic.",Shacolas Tower
50,This is THE place to see the painfully separation of the capital of Cypress. It is amazing that this in our days still continues. Do not run away from this pain but feel it like the locals do when you visit this tower. See with your own eyes how this provocation is still going on...,Shacolas Tower
50,From the observatory you have a panoramic view of all Nicosia main city. The interactive boards complete the experience with stories and descriptions of landmarks.,Shacolas Tower
50,"If you only have a short amount of time to do some tourism, this observatory is well worth the 2Euro entry fee, with interesting computer displays to supplement the marvellous view of the whole city and an interesting short video. It gave me a taste of the City and a sense that I need to come back and spend more tourist time in this interesting country.",Shacolas Tower
40,"The Shacolas Tower isn’t really a museum, more an observation area to see both the Greek and Turkish sides of Nicosia. The touch screen were not operational during our visit.",Shacolas Tower
50,"For the best views in town and only 2 Euros. Windows all round and screens pointing out places of interest. Would hardly call it a museum but well worth the visit and of course, being Debenhams, it gives her an excuse to shop!",Shacolas Tower
40,"For 2 euro you can have amazing views from this 11th floor observatory. Not quiet a museum -more of an information point. All round views, photos and touch screens.You can see both the Greek Cyprus and the Turkish Cyprus sides.If you are planning to cross over to the Turkish side from the Greek side you will probably cross at the Ledra Street crossing -the observatory is in the Debenhams building on Ledra Strret. Best visit before you cross to take in the views and get your bearings.",Shacolas Tower
40,This is an excellent starting point for a visit to the old city of Nicosia. Windows all around the tower provide an excellent view into the walled city. The is a short film on the history of the city and good interactive information to help identify what can be seen below.,Shacolas Tower
40,"I wouldn't call it a museum but maybe more an observation area to have a great view of Nicosia.There are some screens explaining some important landmarks and in the middle there is a movie showing the history of Nicosia.Well like I stated in the headline, if I had expected a museum I probably would have been disappointed. But I came for the view and this does never disappoint.",Shacolas Tower
50,"By far one of the better attractions in Nicosia.Great 360o view of both the Greek and Turkish parts of Nicosia city.Lots of interactive tools: video, timeline, photos, touch screen map; that provides historical information about Nicosia.Excellent photo opportunity and only 2 euros!",Shacolas Tower
30,"Ok, a shopping mall. a decent place to have a coffeee nothing else and nothing special...and I am sorry I did not see any museum there...",Shacolas Tower
40,Great to overlook the city and read some history. In the center of town but you only need an hour up there,Shacolas Tower
50,"Great place to visit. Only 2 Euros per person is really worth it. Great views and short history of Cyprus is presented, if you don't have all day to visit museums, this is the No.1 place to see in Nicosia.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Probably one of the best views of the city? You access the tower, which is also a great landmark for bearings, via Debenhams. The observatory is on the 11th floor and costs €2 to enter. You get a 360 view of the city, and can see the Turkish side and mountains with the Turkish flag cut into the side of the hills.There are diagrams and points of interest marked out and a video to watch which shows the history of the city. Worth a couple of Euro and 30 mins!A free view is from the Debenhams cafe on the 5th floor. It's not 360 but it's good. And the cafe is good value too.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Take the lift to the top floor of the tower. Entrance is to the right of Debenhams store where there are some great aerial photos of the city. Once on the 11th floor, there is a €2 entrance fee and inside there is a 360 view. There are interactive touch screens under each window, so you just touch on what you are looking at and the information is displayed, very good. There is also much information on other historical aspects and a small shop. The staff were also very helpful, Suggest this is a good place to start your visit.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Ticket is 2 Euro.Best part are the touch-screen displays below the viewing windows. It has inscription of the key places of the city that you can see from the tower, even the Turkish part.You see a big building, touch the same building picture on the touch-screen panel and bingo, the description comes.It also has a merchandise section.",Shacolas Tower
30,"The view is spectacular, though the fact its at the top of a Debenhams disturbed me a bit. Plus, you technically dont have to pay the entrance fee if you just want the view, as there's an open window right before you go in. There's some interesting history, but it wasn't spectacular",Shacolas Tower
50,"In my opinion it can be very interesting to visit the Ledra museum-observatory on the 11th floor of Shacolas Tower / Debenhams Building (address is Ledra 171), and see whole Lefkosia/Nikosia from above (see pictures attached). Museum shows and explains a lot about Lefkosia/Nikosias history. A visit to Lefkosia is not complete without seeing this museum.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Great views of the entire city, amazing image of the Turkish flag on the mountain behind, a few info about places around and a small, small price.Really worth the visit!",Shacolas Tower
50,The only place in the city to observe all of the old town including the main attractions of the Northern part. Good interactive guides and a souvenir shop. On top of that the entrance is really cheap - 2 euros. A good place to start your Nicosia experience.,Shacolas Tower
40,It is a really nice place to visit. it provides with a quick history of Nicosia and a rare panoramic view.,Shacolas Tower
50,"Only €2, just go through a door to the right of Debenhams on Ledra and take the lift to the 11th floor. There are all-round views, display panels and touchscreens, and photos from the last 100 years on display. Refreshingly there is plenty of info on the sights in the Northern part of the city, and computer 3D models of some of the most impressive buildings. A bargain!",Shacolas Tower
40,"Nice and easy to get to, well laid out. Good views and very informative. Entry fee was cheap, it was clean and pleasant.",Shacolas Tower
50,"If you go to Nicosia it is well worth going up this tower. It is in the Debenhams building and costs 2 euros, money well spent!",Shacolas Tower
30,"Quite small place and I thought this something more. However, this was cheap place (entrance only 2 euros) to visit and we saw nice views.",Shacolas Tower
50,Museum gives you basic information on history of Nicosia and great 360 view. You can see both Greek part of Nicosia and occupied part. Recommending to go when air is clean and an hour before sunset.,Shacolas Tower
40,I only had a short time in the old town as I was in Nicosia on business. The tower is a great way to see where all the sites are. There are maps and descriptions to describe what you are seeing from the 11th floor windows. Ther eis also a short historical film.,Shacolas Tower
40,Rise above the commercial streets and politics and get some amazing views across the city from nearby mosques to distant mountains,Shacolas Tower
50,"This is a must for any visitor to Nicosia !Not only can you see the ancient and new parts of the city. You can also learn the history of what you looking at in a ""New"" modern way.",Shacolas Tower
30,"There is 2 euros entrance, is at leedras street, they have binoculars if you would like to see more clearly far. Audio and video with the history of nicosia is accompanied, they have screens to explain what is what. If you are local you have to visit it at least one time.",Shacolas Tower
40,"I expected a crowded place and dirty windows (you are not outside when you visit the observatory plarform), but the windows were clean, so we could make pictures, ther airco was on, and there were good information panels",Shacolas Tower
40,We have the chance to visit this observatory every time we have some new visitors. This panoramic view with explanations is most helpful and pleasant.,Shacolas Tower
40,"I have been here four times now and the views never get any less impressive. To access the observatory you must go to Debenhams on Ledras Street and make your way to the 11th floor. You must change elevators on the 6th floor in the cafe. The entrance fee is €2 and is well worth it. There are great 360 degree views of the city, although not much time is needed here - it can be done in around 15 minutes. Nice for a break from the shopping and busy high street below. Souvenirs can also be bought there.",Shacolas Tower
50,Went on a day trip to Nicosia from Aiya Napa while on holiday. I crossed the border into Turkey and managed to squeeze the Observatory in. So glad I did. Brilliant views from the large picture windows and great touch screen information systems. There's a side entrance to the lift at the side of Debenhams to avoid the crowds and takes you directly to the 11th floor. Well worth the 2 euro entrance fee.,Shacolas Tower
40,"Fine views especially across Northern Cyprus. It won't detain you long but even though crossing the 'green line' is pretty easy these days being in the centre of the town, just by Debenhams, the tower is easy to access and well worth a visit.",Shacolas Tower
30,"Had another visit there. This time with guest from Malta . Is a good way to see Nicosia from above. Is a unique point in our town , with public access",Shacolas Tower
50,"Took a friend that was visiting cyprus the other day...!! Nicosia is so unique with its walls going round it and this is the best spot to apprecitate the layout of the old town! Also i hate going to the occupied area but from here one can appreciate this aspect clearly as well. Really worth visiting! There are helpful annotations and a good audio as well. Birds eye view of 360 degrees and useful info about the history of the town!!!!A must visit!!The fee is TOO small (Eur2,00 or something!!!)It is situated in the pedestrian zone of the old town which is a must visit anyway!!! So if you are in the area DO GO UP!!!",Shacolas Tower
50,I am so glad we were told about this view point. There we were searching round for the green line and look out over the dividing wall only to find out you can now access over into the Turkish occupied side. This wasn't possible the last time I visited Nicosia so the information that you get when visiting here was certainly worth it for me to find out why and what had changed. There are computerized screens that are extremely informative and the views of all over Nicosia are amazing. I just wish we had bought our passports along so we could have gone over to the Turkish occupied side and explored further. A must visit if you are coming into Nicosia.,Shacolas Tower
50,its a must if your visiting nicosia plenty to see from this viewpoint and photograph whilst viewing the locals wandering the streets etcbinoculars are provided for the more distant views20% off in the cafe on the admission priceso worth spending a good half a hour in the viewpoint area,Shacolas Tower
50,A must do for any visitor to Nicosia. A full view of the city of Nicosia from both sides of the Green Line.,Shacolas Tower
50,"You have to go there! Its the biggest building in nicosia down town area.Is located in ledra street. From the observatory you can see the inside the wall town, the turkish occupied area as well. Is recommended to go there on a clean weather.",Shacolas Tower
40,In clean and pleasant surroundings with obviously great views...the food available was wide ranging and reasonably priced....especially the salads!Free wifi too!,Shacolas Tower
50,"It was a beautiful day, so the tower provided a wonderful view of the city. The lady guard was very helpful and friendly. I stayed longer than I expected because it was so pleasant. The film was difficult to hear, and I suggest the audio be adjusted so that it can be heard more clearly.",Shacolas Tower
50,"When the tower was first built, I didn't think I would go up more than once.But I find myself taking family and friends to see the view of ALL of Nicosia.They have audio commentary in different languages to help you understand why the capital of Cyprus is divided.",Shacolas Tower
40,Cross country buses from all the major resorts access Nicosia's central bus station.A short walk takes you into the Ledra Street area.Go see the UN crossing point.You will need a passport.Go to Debenham and up to the observation floor.Two euros each where you can see the demarcation lines clearly.Good value for money.Lots of good eateries nearby.Buses every hour 9 euros return in 2014 from Limassol.A good day out.Might be too much for kids to take in?,Shacolas Tower
50,"The Shacolas Tower is located on Ledra Street, right in the middle of Nicosia, which makes possible for everybody to see almost every important building in the Cypriot capital. The observatory have electronic information panels, making this visit an introduction to the city's complex history.",Shacolas Tower
40,"A place where you can enjoy your coffee or drink and you can also pay a visit to the small ""museum"" on the top of the tower, where for a very small fee you can have a majestic view and learn a few things about Cyprus and Nicosia history.",Shacolas Tower
50,We were told about this attraction by the hotel staff. It was definitely worth the visit. It costs €2 to get in but it was so worth it. You get the most stunning views and we were fascinated by the Turkish flag in the hillside of the Northern view.You won't want to spend long here but it was more than worth the fee.,Shacolas Tower
30,"There is a good selection of salads, hot meals, sandwiches and cakes. I had a tuna sandwich and it wasn't fresh, I have heard the same from others as well. I find it a little expensive but the place is clean and there is a view of Nicosia rooftops and the distance.",Shacolas Tower
40,"I actually stumbled across this accidentally, it is on the 11th floor of Debenhams. It costs €2 to enter and has stunning views of the city and the mountains on the northern side. Worth the cheap entry. However, it is very small so be sure to plan other things to do as you won't be there for long!",Shacolas Tower
40,"Thanks to a good guide book (Top 10 Cyprus) we headed for here soon after arrival - it's above Debenhams if you find difficulty in finding it!Interesting view of the occupied part of the city and a film giving the history of the Island - obviously biased to ward the Greek Cypriots but understandable given events since independence.This is a good place to start, with just a small admission fee.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Since we did not want to cross the borders to visit the occupies part of the city, we saw everything from the tower. I found very useful the interactive screens, as well as the photos presenting how the city was.",Shacolas Tower
20,"We read in a guide that it is a very interesting choice to enjoy the view of Nicosia. I think that 2 euros is too much for the observatory, but you can enjoy a nice view of Nicosia in a panoramic manner.",Shacolas Tower
40,"I agree with another commenter that 2 euro is too much (maybe 1.50 would be better) however I like the observatory. It is a very nice idea done with modern technology (touch screen, explanatory maps and a documentary in various languages). You also get a clear view towards the occupied cyprus. I believe something similar should be done in the other cities as well",Shacolas Tower
50,"very useful with its automatic translation in many languages... renovated, great views, very nice virtual tour... and cheap!",Shacolas Tower
40,"Located on the top floor of shacolas tower. In the observatory there is fotos of nicosia from the past. The view is amazing. You can see the walls of nicosia , on top .",Shacolas Tower
50,"The 2 Euro entry charge is good value, at the observation point you get a panoramic view of the whole city and some of its history.There are large touch-screen displays which point out some of the landmarks along with some information about what they used to be and in some cases what they are used for now, especially those over the border on the Turkish side.Well worth a visit if you're in Nicosia",Shacolas Tower
40,"We have taken many visitors here, and feel that it is very informative about points of interest in the North, even if you do not cross over the border.",Shacolas Tower
40,"Shopping , then enjoing a coffee at Debenhams Cafe and at least having the panoramic view of the old town which is divided ,with the one side occupied by the Turks after the Turkish invasion of 1974.I noticed the Ayia sofia Church and the Ledra Palace Hotel and i feel very sorry that this continue to happen after almost 38 years.",Shacolas Tower
40,"With 3D panoramic views of Nicosia, you can see the whole city. There are interactive touch-point screens at every window which inform you of the sights which can be seen. Interesting attraction.",Shacolas Tower
30,"I just wanted to mention that price is now 2 euro per person (not 0.85 as mentioned in another comment), in my personal opinion not worth it for a view of rooftops and some touch screens.Internal and external light reflections in the glasses will ruin most of your photos, you have to be very careful if you are into high quality pictures.",Shacolas Tower
50,"Since you go to the top floor you can see the nicosia inside the wall, and the turkish occupied area. the view is amazing,",Shacolas Tower
50,"An excellent place to see the view of the whole city of Nicosia. Under each windows and there is a photo of the view with explanation in each building. Moreover, there is a touch screen with an interactive map that gives you more info about each building. At the end, you can watch a very informative film about the history of Nicosia. Each viewer wears headphones and selects the desired language (many options, all the main languages). Every tourist must go there!",Shacolas Tower
