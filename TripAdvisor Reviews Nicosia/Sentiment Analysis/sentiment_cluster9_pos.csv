I expected it to be crowded although a week day but it was not. Just very few tables. Lighting is very poor and this would be one thing to maybe find negative.Way too dark. I understand it adds to the atmosphere but it is way overdone. Food was excellent! We had sea bass and chicken al pesto which were super tasty in good portions! Timing was perfect! Dessert was delicious (we had the lava cake with ice cream). Portion is very big and surprisingly much bigger than other places I had this. Maybe dessert itself it was not 10 out of 10 but nearly there (I would give 8 to 9 which makes it almost excellent). I found that food in Domus beats the desserts at least for my opinion. I will agree that prices tend to be on the upper scale especially if you have a bottle of wine but worths it! It's a place for these different, special occasions! Don't miss it!

Combine that with perfect service and you feel that you're the only table in the restaurant (which is never the case - always book in advance!). In the summertime the outdoor seating is a bit of a aesthetic compromise (compared to the interior), but this is Cyprus after all and seating outside to eat in an old part of the city is still very enjoyable.Impeccable dishes (and we made sure to try all of them on the office functions!) I'm sure the menu changes from time to time but the dishes I remember mostly were the succulent lamb shank (no knife needed it was so soft and creamy!) and the best beef carpaccio I have ever had. The friendly owner is always around, making sure everyone is having a good time. This to me is the sign that this restaurant means something more than just 'running a business'.

But it was pointed out nicely by the waitress that they had also wines by the glass. Took a nice local Cypriotic white wine.I started with the Provincale Mussels which was simple and good. Mussels slightly overcooked but the sauce nice and creamy.Main course was served quickly after starter (could have take a bit longer).The Morrocan styled Salmon was cooked perfect exactly how salmon should be to my opinion. I understand the choice of rise (why not couscous) when you call it Morrocan Salom, but it didnt fit me. I ordered it because I was curious about the Morrocan Salmon idea. Killed the curiousity, but I wont order it again.Finished with a After-Eight icecream. Tasteful abd good to finish the meal with (like after-eights).

121,40,"The 'Domus' has held its well deserved, I believe, presence in the Nicosia smart society circles for years now. The secret of its success lies in the uncrowded arrangement of the tables giving the impression of private dining experience, the impeccable service, the more than passable food and the presence of the vibrant lounge bar on the ground floor for before or afters.The first floor restaurant is divided into the many smaller rooms of the restored 19th century mansion it is housed in. The décor here is dark, baring plush red velvet similarities to a 19th century Parisian bordello, albeit of an upmarket, elegant and tasteful variety, and highlighted with touches of late 20th century design. The lounge bar on the ground floor is light and airy, avoiding all the glass and minimalist fashionable commonplaces with a clever use of a plank wood motif.Service is impeccable from the moment you arrive until the complementary liqueurs and coffee.The cuisine is a take on european fusion food, including Italian, generic Mediterranean, nouvelle French touches and with many healthy options. If I have a gripe it is that it panders to Cypriot taste rather than attempt to educate it. The table is tastefully set with tall desert glasses standing for bread baskets. After a beautifully presented amuse bouche of salmon mousse on biscuit courtesy of the chef, our starters of rocca salad, salmon carpaccio (needed more acidity/lemon?), stuffed aubergines and the exceptional pate with cherry compote went down well with my guests. The main courses received mixed comments. The rigatoni with salmon in vodka sauce were surprisingly 'al dente' but could have done with much less or the complete absence of cream. The pork fillet stuffed with wild mushrooms was well executed and tender. My friends declared the chicken Dijon to be the best of the mains. For desert we tried the chocolate soufflé and the healthy option raspberry yoghurt with ice cream.The wine list is short for such a classy restaurant and needs updating. With a choice of Boutari Moschofilero and Muga Rioja, the Domus doesn't come cheap at more than €60 per person.",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 119 Similarity,0.29346959300000003,"{'neg': 0.01, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.9892}",0.9892,pos

At a first glance you see the modern design (Kartell or similar design chairs and tables) , the luxury on the tables (Riedel Crystal glasses and cutlery) and nice location.So the first impression is nice.But when it comes to the service the things are getting really bad, especially for a restaurant of this class and of course those prices.Actually there is a very big delay in all phases of a dining night. We were waiting to be brought the menus, we were waiting for the wine, we were waiting a lot for the starter. But what it was very annoying was the time elapsed between starter and main course. It was near 45! minutes. As you undestand this is unacceptable for such a restaurant. And this happened not only to us but as far a i could understand to all tables. Also we were waiting to pay and we were seeking for a waiter for more that 10 minutes! to give the credit card/What i liked in this restaurant is the wine service. We have ordered a Merlot wine and probably for first time in Cyprus it was brought in the right temperature (15- 16 Celsius) and they kept it like this in an ice container. In most cases in Cyprus Restaurants, red wine is served directly from their storage places and wine temperature is near 25 Celsius! Also the food is really good, fresh and well cooked.Concerning prices, these are certainly high, but at the same level of all rest restaurant of this class in Nicosia. The wine again, is about 4 times more expensive than you buy it in a wine house! As i wrote again i believe that a normal price is 2.5 times more expensive.Another bad thing in this restaurant is the fact that tables in summer are installed outside on the pavement. Of course people that are walking are obliged to walk in the road since pavement is full of tables. But concerning people that are dining this is a bad environment. For example our table was behind a big chipboard of a construction company that was renovating the building next to Domus....I really expected that this restaurant was a step above the rest so called ""gourmet"" Nicosia restaurant but i was disappointed .",Domus Lounge Bar,Review 165 Similarity,0.143019388,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.7589}",0.7589,pos

I complained to your waiter who did not seem to understand what i was saying and requested to speak to the manager to which i was informed that he was unavailable.
