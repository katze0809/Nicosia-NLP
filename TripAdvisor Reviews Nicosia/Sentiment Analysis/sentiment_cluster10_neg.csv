Room is spacious with a small kitchen facility and whilst the lounge and bedroom area were well laid out there were a few drawbacks - No TV in the bedroom area, poor lighting, power going off at night (even when key card left in power switch by the door) meaning gadgets etc were not charging over night. Breakfast was brought to the room but for three days was a little repetitive.

When I was in the room it was very warm, when I was out they were off together with the electricity!Third, the place has no character and gives an unfriendly feeling.

77,10,Booked this hotel for 5 people in 5 seperate rooms. Hotel was booked for a 5.5 week stay per person. Unfortunately all persons on the eigth floor had roaches in their rooms and one person had to be moved. Any requests to speak to the hotel manager were not honoured and staff was terribly rude to the point where one guest was told that they didn't believe that he had roaches in his room and if he did they were probably from his collection????. Fortunately(or unfortunately) the night that one guest was moved he had CAUGHT 4 roaches under glasses to show the management......still has received apology! Totally unacceptable for a business suite hotel which caters to the business proffessional traveller. Left the hotel and found another for all people staying there two weeks into the 5.5 week stay.Will never stay there again and feel sorry for those who do!,Almond Business Hotel,,,"{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.008, 'compound': -0.9482}",-0.9482,neg
89,10,"My husband took me here for our anniversary, and unfortunately it was terrible from the beginning till the end. We had a reservation, but when we arrived there was no one to serve us. After a while someone from the kitchen came to give us some menus, and told us we had to wait for the waitress. No problem there except that we had to wait for the waitress to return from Carrefour with the steaks “imported from France!”The menu was just plain white printed A4 paper where a lot of liquid had been spilled over so it was very difficult to read. The waitress tried very hard, maybe even too hard as she had clearly no experience whatsoever, but ok, everybody has to learn. But explaining us every dish on the menu (what we don’t need since we are from Belgium and we don’t eat anything else but the French kitchen) and explaining it wrong as she did not know where she was talking about, was quit annoying.So far the service… unfortunately it didn’t stop there…The salad with warm goat cheese was just 2 leaves of lettuce with 4 small bolls what you can get from the freezer in a store (probably also Carrefour) as a party snack!The main dish was not properly cooked and the sauce was shifted…Last but not least, the bill was way too high even if the food would have been good.Carrefour may be a French chain; it is still no excuse to say that the food is imported from France!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir,Review 219 Similarity,0.493914581,"{'neg': 0.132, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.9702}",-0.9702,neg

Average quality that you get at lower budget restaurants. Fries were great.Wine (a French Riesling) was served at the wrong temperature. I know is difficult to keep wines cold enough during summer (especially in Nicosia) but at least you need to have the right tools to do this, I would suggest to get proper ice buckets with water.Overall service was ok but slow... the poor girl was running up and down to serve 7 tables (around 20 people).For 1 Quiche, 1 Onion soup, 2 portions (750gr) mussels and a bottle of wine we paid 90 euro which I believe is not value for money if I take into account food quality and service.Things to consider:- Chairs are not comfortable.
