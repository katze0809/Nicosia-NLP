29,20,"The rocket salad consisted of limp green leaves drowned in oil and sun-dried tomatoes that were inedibly tough. Very disappointing. The spicy cheese (tirokafteri) spread had been kept in the fridge so long that it needed to be cut with a knife. Very disappointing. Pork chop was tough and oily. Very disappointing. The service was very good though! However, I will not visit again if the sound situation is not solved. It is impossible to have a conversation because of the noise. The decor leaves a lot to be desired too... A lot of tables and chairs thrown hickeldy-pickeldy in a large plain space.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi,,,"{'neg': 0.188, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.9359}",-0.9359,neg

45,20,I’ve been there with a big group of friends and I wasn’t impressed by the food or the atmosphere. The food did not taste bad but it was not interesting. Because I’ve been to other syrian restaurants in nicosia the other ones had much more tasty food. And the atmosphere has nothing that says “syrian”. Nothing arabic in it. So not my favorite syrian restaurant in Nicosia.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club,Review 58 Similarity,0.472455591,"{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.3564}",-0.3564,neg
87,20,"After visited other Syrian places we found its food poor...Their vegetarian meze (9 euros per person) had only 2 salads, 5 dips, 2 falafels, 2 cheese sticks and the some pitta... The pitta was not fresh, the dips you couldn't tell easy what they were as they had very mild taste and wasn't something special...their falafel wasn't something special also, we had much better elsewhere... In overall, for such a vegetarian friendly cuisine, their meze was very poor and not great...Another thing we didn't like it was that when you sit they bring you a bottle of water, for each you pay for it later (2 euros), without ordering it or want it...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club,Review 141 Similarity,0.412478956,"{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.6284}",-0.6284,neg

The waiter was unfriendly. 2 menus for 5 people. We were basically ignored for much of the meal. And to top it off, my wife had glass in her dessert, I guess it was the manager whomcamemto apologize and tell it that such things happen. Well maybe in Syria they do.

177,10,"This used to be one of my favourite eateries; but over the last 5 years years, the quality of food has declined enormously.
