All male staff seemed to have the same obnoxious non-helpful attitude. The room smelled of moist - hence no ventilation. The aircon heating didn't really work (cold rainy days in Cyprus in February this year). The walls are thin - lots of noise from other rooms and the hall way - especially from the teenage camp installed on the same floor. The in-room breakfast order form didn't work - four of them in the room, but apparently the hotel doesn't use them anymore.

8,30,"Booked in here for 4 nights. Room very basic, no tea or coffee facilities in room, no bottled water provided.Interrupted sleep from racing motor bikes which started up each evening around midnight. Room very warm and no air conditioning this time of year “ It is winter, madam! Was the only explanation we were given.“ My room was unbearably hot as it got the sun from first thing in the morning and for most of the day. Could not leave the window open at night because of the traffic noise. On our third night there the hotel was invaded by a group of 55 teenage school children from Greece and their teachers. They spent most of the evening running up and down the corridors and stairs, banging doors, shouting and laughing. They even knocked on my bedroom door and ran away laughing and screaming. After complaining they were quiet for a short period and then it all started up again. This carried on on and off till 2am.The next morning after once again complaining to the receptionist we were told, “ Well you are checking out this morning,” . Unfortunately as far as we were concerned we knew we had one more night booked as we were told we were booked there for 4 nights. The receptionist then informed us they were fully booked that night and had no free rooms. We had to then pack our bags quickly before leaving and went off to complete our business whilst other arrangements were made. We were then informed that the hotel admitted they had made a mistake in the booking and offered us an upgrade to a suite room in a separate part of the hotel away from the school party. Here we had an excellent nights sleep in a suite that had tea and coffee making facilities, plenty of bottled water and very comfortable surroundings and more importantly was quiet and we got a good nights sleep once the motor bike race had competed for the night.The food in the evenings we ate in was very good and Janis looked after us extremely well. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment as the cooked food, despite being set over heaters, was cold, including the scrambled eggs! The toasters took an age to toast the bread and needed to be put in the moment you entered the dining room so that it was ready by the time you had had some cereal, fruit, yoghurt etc.For business it was fine apart from the teenage school children, although if you are distracted by traffic noise this might not suit you.

10,20,"This has been my favourite hotel since a few years but this time it was a disaster. The hotel is as good as it always is, clean, tidy, service at reception and by the manager most professional, breakfast very generous but a) side reading bed lights are both on, so if one wants to sleep do what I did, unscrew the bulb. Asked reception to fix it but nothing happened, both reading lights are on b) a leaflet in the room welcomes you and offers 20% discount on any food etc. However when we had a snack and drink at the Plaza cafe, they said to our great suprise that this is not valid !!! c) worst of all, on Fridays and Saturdays though this is an inhabited area just before midnight several huge motorcycles apparently without any silencers challenge each other at highest possible speeds and the noise is beyond any description. You feel as if 50 tanks are speeding around the hotel. Called reception at 02.00 hours he said there is nothing to be done. Called police at 03.20 (after midnight) he said a patrol car would be in the area. Half an hour later the same situation the tank battle with disturbing sounds that one could hear miles away continued all through the night till morning . It is surprising that others have commented on this yet the police obviously couldn't care less. On Saturday night we bought some ear plugs, but this was a terrific night worse than the previous one. Just horrible .. Lastly, when we arrived there were no bath towels in the room...The hotel is not responsible for the racing noise but they have the obligation to demand action by the police.

12,20,"I'm very dissapointed with the reception service. I asked for a room on the back side, and receptionist said I have no luck, there was no free one. I asked him just because the street is so noisy in the night caused by street car and motorcycle racing. Receptionist told me that it is rarely, and to keep the windows closed. It was noisy again and too hot in the room, and rarely - every night. Rooms are too small, and average clean. Under our window were big garbage containers, so very bad smell came to our room. We booked a tripple room and got 2 beds and roll away bed. On my complain, receptionist answered that they don't have tripple room. Only wiht extra child bed. But on the invoice, surprising but expected, they have. They charged me full price for roll away bed as for normal one!!!!First evening I asked the receptionist to call a cab for us 5, and I told him which company to call. First he didn't understand that we needed the cab at 7 p.m. He ordered for next day at 7 a.m. Then he refused to call Taxi cab (the best one) telling me that they have theirs. After 20-25 min cab came but normal car for 4 people. We all managed to sqeezed in a car. One problem solved. Than came the other one. The driver doesn't speeks english, only russian. The third problem was that he didn't knew which way to drive to asked address. I gave him my cell phone with google map, We were very happy when we reached our destination.Breakfast is pretty good, but the coffee was awful.

Basic amenities, old fashioned rooms, basic breakfast etc.What I wasn't comfortable with was the cleanliness of the room which I was not 100% sure of. There were some vague stain on the sheets and the overall feeling of the room was that it was not spotless. The piece de resistance, was a hole on the floor which was neatly covered by the carpet. Unfortunately this was discovered by my wife who was in high heels at the time- she was not happy about it! Another issue for me was that the minibar was locked and I only discovered this in the early morning hours when I woke up and needed some water.As I said, the hotel, for a 3 star is OK. However the price (special offer at EUR100 for one night), I thought was ridiculous, especially as I had recently paid slightly more to stay at a 5 star beach resort in Cyprus.
