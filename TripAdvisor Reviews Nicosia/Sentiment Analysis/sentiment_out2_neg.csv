This is the worst hotel stay I’ve ever experienced and I travel a lot. I don’t get it.

3,20,"Many things to report about this hotel. Unfortunately most of them are bad: Upon late night arrival ""greeted"" by an inhospitable receptionist. All male staff seemed to have the same obnoxious non-helpful attitude. The room smelled of moist - hence no ventilation. The aircon heating didn't really work (cold rainy days in Cyprus in February this year). The walls are thin - lots of noise from other rooms and the hall way - especially from the teenage camp installed on the same floor. The in-room breakfast order form didn't work - four of them in the room, but apparently the hotel doesn't use them anymore. The breakfast was mediocre and repetitive - they turned off the heat under the ""hot"" food half an hour before closure leaving luke warm food for the last guests. The wifi is super…",Europa Plaza Hotel,"{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.902, 'pos': 0.017, 'compound': -0.7168}",-0.7168,neg

10,20,"This has been my favourite hotel since a few years but this time it was a disaster. The hotel is as good as it always is, clean, tidy, service at reception and by the manager most professional, breakfast very generous but a) side reading bed lights are both on, so if one wants to sleep do what I did, unscrew the bulb. Asked reception to fix it but nothing happened, both reading lights are on b) a leaflet in the room welcomes you and offers 20% discount on any food etc. However when we had a snack and drink at the Plaza cafe, they said to our great suprise that this is not valid !!! c) worst of all, on Fridays and Saturdays though this is an inhabited area just before midnight several huge motorcycles apparently without any silencers challenge each other at highest possible speeds and the noise is beyond any description. You feel as if 50 tanks are speeding around the hotel. Called reception at 02.00 hours he said there is nothing to be done. Called police at 03.20 (after midnight) he said a patrol car would be in the area. Half an hour later the same situation the tank battle with disturbing sounds that one could hear miles away continued all through the night till morning . It is surprising that others have commented on this yet the police obviously couldn't care less. On Saturday night we bought some ear plugs, but this was a terrific night worse than the previous one. Just horrible .. Lastly, when we arrived there were no bath towels in the room...The hotel is not responsible for the racing noise but they have the obligation to demand action by the police. As it is today, it is impossible to sleep and I am not exaggerating.",Europa Plaza Hotel,"{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': -0.8261}",-0.8261,neg

55,30,"The hotel's location makes it very convenient for a business trip in the area with nicosia's embassies and business centers. One which is further from the city center and reachable by taxi or by feet (a twenty minutes walk). So depending on the purpose of the visit you might hate it or find it very convenient. The rooms are decent and offer a basic comfort - not impressively good nor unbearably bad. Very clean and polite cleaning service. The staff is always willing to help. The breakfast offer is average, but you can have a plentiful breakfast. The restaurant also offers good dishes at decent prices. It is a hotel i don't have anything against, but which also didn't positively surprised me. A minus might be the poor control of room temperature, as the nights were quite cold and couldn't heat properly the room.

60,20,"I had to stay in Nicosia for business as this is not a holiday/ weekend break destination. I picked the hotel as it was the nearest to a funciton I had to attend.The hotel itself, I believe is a 3 star and for a 3 star it is ok. Basic amenities, old fashioned rooms, basic breakfast etc.What I wasn't comfortable with was the cleanliness of the room which I was not 100% sure of. There were some vague stain on the sheets and the overall feeling of the room was that it was not spotless. The piece de resistance, was a hole on the floor which was neatly covered by the carpet. Unfortunately this was discovered by my wife who was in high heels at the time- she was not happy about it! Another issue for me was that the minibar was locked and I only discovered this in the early morning hours when I woke up and needed some water.As I said, the hotel, for a 3 star is OK. However the price (special offer at EUR100 for one night), I thought was ridiculous, especially as I had recently paid slightly more to stay at a 5 star beach resort in Cyprus. Furthermore the receptionist insisted that I should prepay the whole amount instead of paying upon my departure which I thought was strange.My low rating has more to do with its price rather than the actual hotel.",Europa Plaza Hotel,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.039, 'compound': -0.7447}",-0.7447,neg
