While finding our way to and inside the old town and then a safe parking was not exactly easy (no indication), the Buyuk Han, an old caravanserail converted into a handicraft and tourist centre, is definitely worth visiting (and the Selimye mosk, or former Agia Sophia cathedral, is next door). Off season there were few tourists but all the 1st level handicrafts/demonstration shop were closed. Plenty of tourist shops in the courtyard but we would recommend the Havva Senol (first shop on the left on the same side as the Sedirhan restaurant) where we had a smiling welcome and were offered coffees and seats while the owners were getting stamps for us from the post office. They spoke good English which is quite rare in North Cyprus (apart from imported staff from Asia or Africa...) and makes communication difficult.

662,50,"I've stayed at the Cleopatra several times on business over the last few years and decided it really is time to leave some feedback!This is certainly a very compact hotel and the bedrooms are on the small side. However, this minor inconvenience is outweighed by the many good points this hotel has. Although small, the bedrooms are very nicely appointed (make sure you book a refurbished room though as the others are dated and worn). The furniture is smart, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean and modern and the air conditioning is efficient (and fairly quiet when on a low setting at night).Admittedly, the small size of the room (and balcony) means that you won't want to spend hours in it but then why bother coming to Nicosia if you're going to stay in your room?! (Honeymooners excepted of course).The bar is very nicely designed with comfortable lounge seating or tables/chairs if you wish to dine. The lighting is low and sometimes the TV is blaring out in Greek but just ask Costas (the bartender) to turn your lights up and the TV down - he's a fabulous guy who will go out of his way to accommodate your needs.The restaurant is cosy with the usual buffet breakfast n the mornings (nothing special but perfectly acceptable). I've never had lunch or dinner in the restaurant as there are so many great places to eat in Nicosia so can't comment on the food.The pool area is pleasant with a pool bar (staff are friendly as they are throughout the hotel) and at night the pool area is set up for romantic, candlelit dinners (again, I always go out and so can't comment on the food).There is a gym at the back of the hotel which I find excellent as Nicosia doesn't really lend itself to going out for long runs - the gym is a little hot but not enough to use as an excuse not to use!!Wifi is available at a charge in your bedroom but is a good speed - for cheapskates out there, you can borrow a cable and access free internet in the bar if you wish.The location of the hotel is just perfect for exploring Nicosia and eating out at night. Within a ten-minute walk you can either be in the heart of the old town, eating at the numerous tavernas, cafes and restaurants (or Wagamamas, McDonalds, TGIs etc for those less adventurous) or exploring modern shops .Please note that being in such a central location, this does mean that there is traffic noise at night if you wish to leave your balcony door open. However, when closed, the sound -proofing is excellent.Although a short drive in a taxi, I strongly recommend the Aegean restaurant - situated at the back of a bookshop in an older part of the city, the food and ambiance are both first class (book ahead and get an upstairs, balcony table). The restaurant is in an open courtyard so you can watch the stars as you eat some of the best Cypriot food in Nicosia.

The gentleman in charge of the bar is very nice and attentive and the cleaning staff are professionals too.Things to improve:Breakfast: the table sets are rarely cleaned. On the first day, I had to ask one of the restaurant staff to remove the brown table sets (which were full of bread and stains) and also remove and change the white table cloth which was also full of stains. He was pretty rude and changed the table set with a smirk.On the second day, it was the same. This time we informed the restaurant manager and only after he told the staff, they really started cleaning the tables!As for breakfast itself, this time it was not like before. It seems that for example they don‚Äôt wash the cheese plates from one day to the other. You see finger prints all over the dishes.Swimming pool:The pool opens at 10 and exactly at the same time, the hotel staff starts reorganizing all the tables and chairs ... tons of clashes between chairs and tables every single day. On one occasion one more senior staff started shouting at a junior one! These tasks can perhaps be done the night before or earlier in the morning.Also the pool seems to be open to public. There is no shower, so people just walk in and enter the pool. It seems to be a popular place for children and their parties, but there is absolutely no code of conduct. Children are left to their own devices while their parents fill the pool area with smoke - literally. There is no such thing as conversation. To communicate with their children, parents shout from one side of the pool to the other.So if you expect some relaxing time or a proper swim, you will be disappointed.

776,20,"I stayed in Cleopatra Hotel for ten days in February. It is supposed to be a 4-star Hotel. I understand that there are some facilities available to justify the 4-star, but overall I would say that this is at best an average 3-star Hotel.In particular, some positive comments are:1) cleanliness: As far as I remember, the room was cleaned every day,2) location: It is situated near the old town of Nicosia and other than that in a very central and convenient location.Some negative points are:1) The most important was the quality of breakfast, which was mediocre at best. There are indeed some choices to select from, but they are not of top quality. For example, the Hotel offers the typical small packed marmalades. Instead they could have offered home made (or similar) marmalades in jars. The same is true for the butter, honey, etc. They offer the same eggs and roasted bacon every day (the same bad quality of bacon every day). They could offer some fresh products or typical of Cyprus, like pies, to transform their breakfast in a traditional flavour experience. This breakfast is just the typical breakfast offered in the Hotels throughout Europe twenty years ago, and fortunately is not served anymore. The only positive thing was the fresh fruits.2) There were tea and coffee facilities in the room, but the tea-bags were not replaced every day.3) The rooms are not soundproof, and if your room is situated from the side of the road, you may encounter great problems with the noise.4) The Hotel gives an overall impression that it needs renovation.5) I have also a personal complaint. I did encounter a problem with the payment via my credit cards and it did seem that I had paid twice my bill (which was indeed true). I did ask for assistant from the Hotel reception. Although they did offer the assistance required after all, I had to send some mail reminders and to wait three or four days until they did send me the specific info I needed. I believe that this kind of service is unacceptable for a 4-star Hotel, especially when considering such a small, but important matter.Overall, I would say that for the rate of this Hotel (approximately 100 euros per night), you do not get what you pay for.

Its rates were somewhat more economical than many hotels in the area and breakfast -- a very lovely buffet breakfast that included eggs, meats, cheeses, fruits, cereals, fresh bread, coffee, tea, juice -- is included in the price. The hotel is in a nice neighborhood with restaurants, banks and shops nearby. Old town Nicosia is a 15 minute walk away. Right now there is a construction site adjacent to the hotel and noise from that, which seems to start in-between 7-8am -- can be difficult for a good night's sleep. Hotel decor is dated (closet doors and carpets are slightly worn) but the room was clean and spacious enough by European standards. There are stairs leading up to the main entrance that would be difficult for a disabled person to climb (I was traveling with a colleague on crutches, and had to help her up the stairs). The lobby and restaurant have old world charm. The rooms include a mini-bar fridge with enough space to store a few of your own things (I am vegan and being able to store my own food is important to me). The room included a blow dryer and someone told me the hotel has guest laundry rooms available for use (I wish I would've known that earlier on in my stay, I would've used it). Sometimes, on the way up the stairs, I could smell smoke in the hallways. I think smokers use the stairwells -- which separate from the main hallways where the rooms are located by double glass doors -- creating the odor. There is an elevator that could help guests avoid the unpleasant smell but I know some people are bothered by cigarette smoke. My room had a small balcony with plastic lawn chairs and I'm certain, when the weather is warmer, it would be nice to sit outside. Outside the front of the hotel there is a wicker sofa and chairs off to the side, and it was a pleasant place to sit while I waited for taxis to arrive. The hotel has air conditioning. WiFi was okay (and free) but in the evenings the signal could be a bit spotty. Overall I had a good stay and I tend, on my own dime, to prefer hotels like this with ""character"" vice luxury hotels which cost an arm and a leg. I would stay here again, most definitely.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 70 Similarity,0.46013135899999996,Review 24 Similarity,0.06872081299999999,"{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9915}",0.9915,pos

785,50,"I enjoyed a very pleasant two-night stay here, on a recent visit to Nicosia. I had booked an executive room, and was upgraded to a suite (Room 118) on arrival.The suite was extremely spacious, and extremely comfortable. The main sitting room was comfortable, with sofa, chairs, and large television screen. It was stylish and contemporary, with very effective air conditioning. Adjoining this room was a small outside balcony. The separate bedroom was also very spacious, with comfortable king bed, decent pillows, desk, and a small table and chairs. A separate and effective air conditioning unit here ensured agreeable temperatures in the city‚Äôs high summers. The bathroom was also of a decent size, with large soft towels, and good toiletry products. Overall, it was a lovely room. The suite had a security safe, and a minibar (at additional cost, naturally). The maintenance on the room was good; it was generally devoid of marks and scratches, though the bedhead had some signs of wear. I was really pleased with the overall appearance and serviceability of the room. The wireless connection and strength were good. The room did not contain a full length mirror, nor an iron and a board, though ironing facilities were available in an ironing room on the third floor (but keep in mind it‚Äôs only available until 18:00 or 19:00).My only comment about the overall standard of the hotel‚Äôs appearance is that the public hallways to the bedrooms really need a refresh, to reflect the standard within the room. They were tired and dated, and could do with a repaint, new carpet, and some contemporary artwork on the walls.A decent buffet breakfast is included in the room rate. There‚Äôs a good selection of fresh fruits, cereals, pastries, breads, cheeses and cold meats, as well as hot breakfast items (fried eggs, bacon, sausage etc). On the first morning there was a presentable selection of traditional Cypriot breakfast items; I enjoyed sampling these more so than the standard hot breakfast selection. The coffee, however, was fairly ordinary- just a jug of brewed coffee rather than a barista style offering. There‚Äôs a couple of good coffee shops across the road if you are hankering for a double espresso. However, you won‚Äôt starve at the hotel and should leave well-fed!The hotel is not located within the old town area of Nicosia (that is, within the Venetian walls). However, it‚Äôs an easy (and directionally uncomplicated) walk of no more than ten minutes to the start of Ledra Street within the walled old town.Reservation was easy via the hotel‚Äôs website, and the first night‚Äôs charge for my stay was taken at point of reservation. The hotel represents very good value; my room rate per night was ‚Ç¨xxxx. Coming from London in the UK, where hotel rooms are extortionate, this was much to my liking.The hotel has a pool, but I did not use that.The hotel staff were helpful and efficient, polite and professional.I could not have asked for a better stay.

791,20,"This hotel advertises itself as a four star hotel; I couldn't disagree more. My overall impression was that guests' needs come after the needs of the hotel staff. I will give some examples:1. I asked for an iron to be delivered to my room on a Sunday evening at 6 PM. The front desk told me that the part of the hotel that could deliver an is closed and I will have to wait till 7 AM the next day to get an iron. This is an iron-not a masseuse, not a neurosurgeon to treat my migraine- an iron!!2. The hotel has a lovely outdoor pool. Unfortunately, the pool is only open from 10 AM till 6 PM. In addition, In order to get to the pool, you have to walk through many different corridors of the hotel-there is no lift to the pool. When you exit the pool you cannot go back into the hotel. You must instead go on the street, walk a bit, and then enter back to the hotel's main entrance. You better have a towel to dry off because otherwise you're walking in your bathing suit on the streets of Nicosia.3. The Cleopatra Hotel has a very nice gym. They apparently offer gym memberships for residents of Nicosia. As a hotel guest, you're permitted to use the gym. The hours of the gym on the weekends end at 6 PM. They advertise themselves as a four star hotel, but I don't believe closing the gym at 6 PM on the weekend is really four star treatment.4. Almost every hotel that I've ever stayed and has a nicely bound guestbook which explains all of the policies of the hotel. There is no guestbook at the Cleopatra Hotel. Instead they have several xerox copies of the various policies that they have in place at the hotel. This seems rather unprofessional.5. Referring back to #4, the list of rules for the pool alone, for example, is 30 items long. The warning prohibiting topless sunbathing is mentioned twice-I guess they had a problem with this. My favorite rule,however, is # 11- ""spitting or throwing garbage inside and outside the pool is prohibited""6. The Internet sign in & password were not offered on arrival. Having to call the front desk after realizing the password was not supplied was less than 4 star customer service.To prove that I am not a totally negative reviewer, I must mention that the breakfast is quite good with lots of variety. The Internet is fairly fast. The pool is excellent as long as you arrive between 10 and 6 PM. Ditto on the gym. The location of the hotel is quite good and I am told that each room has its own balcony.In conclusion, this hotel really needs to step up its game and train its staff on customer service.",Cleopatra Hotel,Review 167 Similarity,0.39277666,Review 57 Similarity,0.03827795,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.9686}",0.9686,pos

As no passport, no crossing!When on the Cyprus side, I was just waved through before I had even got my passport out, then when in ""no mans land"" which is effectively a wooden shed making up a tunnel that takes you to the Turkish side, you will wait a good 10 minutes, as they do check your passport (though do not stamp it, they put your details into the computer).Pretty surreal, as for only a few yards, the difference is night and day! On the Greek Cyprus Side its pretty much the feel of the rest of Cyprus, but as soon as you pass the Turkish passport check, you suddenly get a VERY Turkish feel to the place.Seems to be that getting from Cyprus to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus takes a lot longer than on the way back, as did the return journey in just a minute or so.All in all, not as off putting as it may sound/look, and the northern quarter does have a nice charm to it and good to walk around.Watch out for customs on the way back, as I heard stories at the football match later in the day of people getting stung for import tax for taking cigarettes across the border.",Ledras,Review 25 Similarity,0.46549616,Review 66 Similarity,0.453742606,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.9333}",0.9333,pos

Once you find the border crossing (which we stumbled across by chance) it is very easy to cross. Just walk through, pass the rather charming hippy peace camp until you get to a passport booth, fill in a white slip which you will find at the front of the booth (just push in and grab one) so that your passport isn't stamped, then continue into north Nicosia. There was no fee to cross, I didn't see any time limit for coming back, and most places take Euros on the other side (2TL=‚Ç¨1 April 2012) all rather simple really.
