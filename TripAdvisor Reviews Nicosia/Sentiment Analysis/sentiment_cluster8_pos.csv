0,30,"The Centre of Visual Arts and Research (CVAR) is both interesting and somewhat disappointing. I expected to find contemporary (or modern) Cypriot art, but CVAR contains art mainly by British and French visitors to Cyprus from the 1800s to the present. It shows Cyprus through the eyes of those who visited, and those who marketed the island as a travel destination. It also contains a collection of costumes and accessories and details how they were influenced by both Eastern and Western fashions, and its collection of memorabilia includes the last flag that flew over Government House, various bric-a-brac and items from the camps where the British interred illegal immigrants who had survived the holocaust and were trying to sail to Palestine (then under British Mandate). The latter was an interesting find as I have not seen any evidence of these internment camps anywhere else in Cyprus in the twenty years I have been visiting. CVAR's research library also contains thousands of books on the history and art of Cyprus, as well as a large number of newspapers and magazines.Overall, CVAR was not at all what I had expected. Anyone seeking out contemporary Cypriot art needs to find the National Gallery for Contemporary Art at No. 1 Kritis Street in Nicosia. CVAR, on the other hand, offers what I would describe as a colonial gaze upon Cyprus. However, it is well laid out and easy to follow. I would recommend it on the proviso that visitors know what they are getting before they arrive.",Centre of Visual Arts and Research,"{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9542}",0.9542,pos

I have reviewed each separately, as they all warrant a visit in their own right, for different reasons.It's certainly worth a visit if you are interested in architecture, and the history of Nicosia and its Venetian walls (as I am). It's a bit of a walk from Ledra Street, and is located in the east of the city next to the Caraffa bastion, not far from the Green Line where it crosses the Venetian walls in the east.It's a squat, solid stone gate, built in the 1560s, and is the largest of the three gates in the Venetian walls. It's also well preserved, being restored in 1981. It's so named because it opened onto the road which led to the important harbour town of Famagusta. I didn't think it's the most visually impressive of the gates; my choice there gores to the Kyrenia Gate in Lefkoşa in the Turkish occupied north. Apparently it's a copy of a gate in Heraklion in Crete.It consists of two gates which are connected by a vaulted tunnel passage. There's a domed room in the middle of the tunnel to let light in. During the Ottoman occupation its said that Turks / Muslims could ride on horseback through the gate, whilst everyone else had to walk.Today its used as a cultural venue, for concerts and venues.

So unfortunately it fits with much of the negative stereotype of bland, healthy vegan food. It's ok to try and be healthy, but they could make the food tasty at the same time and a bit more decadent.We had the vegan lentil moussaka which was very bland and the burgers, which I'm sorry to say were probably one of the worst veggie ones I've ever had. Even the lemonade was disappointing, there was no sourness or taste of lemons in it, just bitterness from the lemon seeds.The only nice thing I had was the apple pie, the vegan 'ice cream' that came with it, was no ice cream at all, more like flavoured ice.It's a real shame that as the only veggie/vegan place in Nicossia, they serve such bland food, I feel it would put most people off ever becoming vegan or veggie, if they associated this food with that lifestyle.Better to brand themselves as a health food place, and not a veggie/vegan place, as I feel they are hurting the cause. Otherwise try to add more richness and taste to the food.Sorry for the harsh criticism, but I am passionate about good food and equally about veganism(, to help the animals, for the environment, for our health etc)so I really want to promote that vegan food can and should be delicious and not just healthy.",Ingas Veggie Heaven,"{'neg': 0.135, 'neu': 0.707, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.7696}",0.7696,pos

189,40,"I read about this unique restaurant in TripAdvisor, and as we were looking for a change to our meat based diet; we considered this restaurant as a good choice.The restaurant is an old house located at the edge of the old Nicosia area, and although the streets are very narrow; there was ample parking space.The reception was wonderful and warm; we sat in the outdoor area surrounded by flowers and the Crafts Center; it was hot but bearable.The Lady was doing the cooking and also offering the Menu on a blackboard that she brought to our table. As this was our first time to this restaurant she offered us to have a small portion of every item on the Menu; it was a great idea.The Bread was very fresh, the Hummus was good, the Mixed Salad with dry figs and pine seeds was tasty but not very fresh, the Eggplant and Feta Lasagna was average, the Curry Cauliflower Stew with rice was superb, the Vegan Asparagus Quiche was fine except that the crust was very hard to cut, the two Veggie Burgers were unique and tasty, the Cabbage Rolls were extremely delicious.The service was excellent, and the prices are very reasonable.",Ingas Veggie Heaven,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9846}",0.9846,pos
190,50,"As a Food Critic I consider it a rare find as it differs from other restaurants.I am always searching for the very best and this humble little restaurant captured my heart from the first bite.Unique in its kind with owners two adorable ladies, Inga and Itala who work with passion and love behind their cuisine and it is this love for excellent taste that they want to share with us, their customers.Located in a quiet neighborhood of the old city, a little out of the centre, but still not that far from the main Ledra Street. Easy to find as it is part of a Craft centre. I was coming from the Cyprus Hilton however, so I was dropped by taxi here for €6.00.Humble and minimalistic interior. Space inside is limited, 3 or 4 small tables the maximum, but customers can enjoy their meals out by the patio at the flowery little garden. The yard is surrounded by several interesting Art workshops which by the way, I urge you to visit while there. Personally, I found them interesting.**Have in mind that portions on my photos are not the normal. I am mostly nibbling and trying the cuisine.FOOD OPTIONS:I had the opportunity to try a few of the dishes starting with the Raw Vegetable Soup that is served cold and is way too refreshing and super tasty. Ideal for the warm days of summer!Salad accompanies each meal and portions are huge. The Mixed Salad I had included dry figs, pinecone seeds and avocado and it was a delight.MAIN COURSES:I tried the super yummy Lasagna and Inga’s hearty Spring rolls which are not similar not even in shape to spring rolls we come across in other restaurants. It is a nutrient roll in a way full of flavour and taste.Be sure to try the Vegetable Burger topped with guacamole. It is way too popular here. Succulent and colorful a burger that I bet you will enjoy and return for more.If you love Indian food, try the vegetarian version of Curry. I tried Inga’s Vegetable Curry Korma and it was a delight. Definitely another dish to be considered!DESSERT:The restaurant prides for its super yummy desserts.I asked for something light to have with my coffee. The owners recommended the Vegan Lebanese Coconut Cream and it was the perfect choice. Mouthwatering and tempting. (€2.50).Of course one can choose from Chocolate Truffles, Ginger biscuits and homemade Muffins and a couple of more.IN ALL: In this tiny cute and picturesque little restaurant I experienced new tastes, made friends and enjoyed every minute of this “Taste Journey” as I like to call it when I am out trying new flavors. I highly recommend this business, and by all means you don’t have to be a vegetarian to visit it, only because there is something for everyone. Come here even for coffee and try the amazing homemade cakes, and sweets!",Ingas Veggie Heaven,"{'neg': 0.007, 'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.246, 'compound': 0.9992}",0.9992,pos
