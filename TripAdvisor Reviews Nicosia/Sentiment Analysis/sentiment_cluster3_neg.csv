17,30,"Let's start from the pro:- slighltly cheaper than the nicosia average- 24h reception- free parking (around 5 places)- comfortable rooms (a bit small but fine for the price)- air conditioningThe cons:- 20 min on foot from the city center- wifi only in the main hall- no safe in the rooms- awful breakfastSo the recommendation is: ok if you don't find anything else better and tou are ready to eat out in the morning.A special note about the breakfast: at 9 they were not refilling the food even if supposed until 10, the personnel (not even saying hello) had no idea how the toast machine was working. Coffee was disgusting and food of poor quality (and always the same), fruit almost rotten. I would have given a general higher rate if they hadn't provided breakfast at all for the same price.",Averof Hotel,"{'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.142, 'compound': -0.1432}",-0.1432,neg
32,10,"Booked for location and family run Cypriot friendly hotel. NOPE. Miserable, terrible hotel damp and very unfriendly building and people. Uncomfortable bed didnt sleep a wink and no hot water. Planned a two day trip one night over in Nicoisa as staying in Polis to explore the city. This ruined our trip we could not wait to check out, parking up for the second day and used the car rather than the room!Dont bothers its not cheap and the breakfast was laughable margarine, bread and 1 glass of awful orange juice. Never met such unhospitable Cypriots as in this hotel.",Averof Hotel,"{'neg': 0.14, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': -0.7354}",-0.7354,neg
36,20,"I stayed at the Averof Hotel with my father during my visit in Nicosia for research purposes. The hotel is overall bad, even for the comparatively low amount of money paid. Hotel is old, incredibly tacky decorated (the web site claims that to be'traditional' decoration, but this is just an excuse for a tasteless decoration). Breakfast is bad, with very limited variety (i never understand what kind of coffee was the one available at the 'buffet' comprising by two tables). The Hotel has two floors but NO LIFT (without any relevant warning in the website) so is not recommended to anyone with mobility problems. Rooms were fairly spacious with balconies. TV broken, AIR-CON ADDITIONALLY CHARGED (5 euros per day), towels provided only for the one of us and we had to ask for more, they were never changed within 4 days (neither the bed set), generally, CLEANLINESS IS A BIG PROBLEM as the hotel is dirty throughout and there is a constant feeling of dust covering everything, from reception to bath tubes. Staff is ok. Location is very peaceful which is nice but is not as close to the city centre as someone can assume reading the rest of the reviews.",Averof Hotel,"{'neg': 0.172, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9792}",-0.9792,neg
39,10,"This hotel was the worst ""hotel"" ever imaginable and I am surprised they are still in business. There was no water to take a shower and the place was filthy. I would recommend going to Classic Hotel or the Cleopatra. Don't waste your money on this hotel (which is very shady).",Averof Hotel,"{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': -0.1451}",-0.1451,neg
2,10,"Hotel is well located for reaching the tourist district. Otherwise dreadful.I recently booked to stay at the Crown Inn Hotel in Nicosia with my husband, adult children & grandchildren. On our arrival to the rooms we were not at all happy with the cleanliness of our rooms - beds had hair on the pillows & one bed had dirty bedsheets, the floors were not vacuumed nor mopped & the hallways were also dirty. We demanded & received a full refund & went elsewhere. No apology for the state of the rooms & no offer to clean them. We booked this hotel based on its location & the glowing reviews on all travel sites however the state of cleanliness needs to be brought to the attention of other travellers!!!",Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': -0.8471}",-0.8471,neg
5,30,This was my third time here and itâ€™s gone down hill. Grubby around the edges even though they have painted the rooms new mattress but very thin problem getting second pillow sockets hanging off ceiling rose hanging down broken shower 2x toasters but not working food poor and not cheap any more shame as it was good and could be again,Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.738, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': -0.7598}",-0.7598,neg
8,20,"The worst bed I have ever slept on, you could literally feel the springs. Trying to get a drink was ridiculous, no wine, no tonic, no soda. Breakfast wasn't edible.

39,20,"The reception staff Ms.Sophie and Mr.Harris, nice of them to refund one night's stay and let me leave early. The breakfast was satisfactory. The proximity to the bus stop, the availability of parking space. The Hotel is very shabby. The room was depressing so stayed in the lobby chatting with the evening receptionist Sophie which we thoroughly enjoyed. The bed was very uncomfortable with the mattress in poor condition and sinking in in the middle and the bathroom sink faucet were leaking.",Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.126, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': -0.25}",-0.25,neg
63,30,Hotel outside the city center in the quiet neighberhood. 20 minutes walking from the old town. Rooms not very pleasant - old furniture and very noisy refigerator. Very small bathroom. Breakfast ok but nothing special. No wifi in the room.

64,10,"I was placed in this hotel, as most others seemed to be full, due to the EU ministerial gathering. The room (No 113) was tiny with two single beds. The bed-covers had the most disgusting, huge and varied collection of stains one could imagine!! I felt like throwing them out of the balcony... The shower room was equally tiny and its door would bang the second bed when you tried to open it more than half way. One of the bath towels was near the state of complete disintegration (if you'd rub hard, it may fall apart completely). The bed was very hard and small and the tiny pillow filled with hard lumps. I could hardly sleep all night! There was a small fridge with half-broken shelves and a squeaky door that made a lot of noise. Decor and beds old and seriously unattractive. Dust was obvious everywhere. The front desk lady was pleasant (unlike the manageress/owner (?), whose portrait decorates the dimly lit dining room). Breakfast seemed OK, but I was in such a hurry to escape, I could hardly bother. AVOID, please!",Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.5101}",-0.5101,neg
