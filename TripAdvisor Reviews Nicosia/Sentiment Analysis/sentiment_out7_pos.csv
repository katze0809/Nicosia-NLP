Well, unfortunately for them I am going to urge you all to try this place as a must visit restaurant if you are in Nicosia (indeed, Cyprus - it is worth the trip). Unexpectedly one of the best burgers I have ever had, washed down with some Paulener Weissbier - another surprise on the menu.I was told by Amalia, who served us very well and was the perfect host, that the menu changes regularly with seasonal produce and new creations from the head chef, Evagoras. The burger, however, has been on the menu from day 1 (two years ago) and I can see why.If you are looking for excellent food in a cosy, informal and local atmosphere then I cannot recommend this place highly enough.",Cook Shop,"{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9701}",0.9701,pos

You know what I am definitely going back, maybe not during the hot months though. Let's start with the Starters. We went for a smoked aubergine salad with halloumi, unique taste and not at all heavy. Word of warning it is a starter not a full blown salad. Accompanied with 1/4 of mussels. They were superb! In terms of Mains, we all had something different. From a beef burger (chips are difficult to resist) to sea bass on beetroot mash, to seafood risotto and finally my dish, salmon cooked in a mango sauce served with asparagus and the most amazing rice which had a subtle almond flavour. Even though we were rather full we thought we'd try the desserts. Only two on the menu, brownies and rice pudding. Two different proposals. Loved them both. The distinct flavour of coconut milk and berries jam on top of the rice pudding. And a light creme brulee flavoured whipped cream accompanying the brownies! All that cost around €100 including water, soft drink, 3 small bottles of wine and tea/coffee. A very good deal!

All was cooked well, except I was surprised not to be asked how we would like the lamb to be cooked.
