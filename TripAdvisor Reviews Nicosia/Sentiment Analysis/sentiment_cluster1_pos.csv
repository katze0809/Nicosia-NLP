I am all for giving a place second and third chances but the haphazardness of the quality of service must be noted as it ranges from excellent to very bad and everything in between. The food is good, nothing stellar but decent if you do not have many expectations for a sushi place in a taste and experience- wise super-conservative country. The prices are ok -- we paid 25 euros per person (group of 4) for a shared starter plate, main dish and one bottle of wine. It is not great but everything is overpriced in Cyprus so I am noting this in context. The location is also good as it is very central and there is plenty of parking. The outside part is also nice in the summer-- it is cosy and the feeling of being on top of a building adds atmosphere-- although it could seriously use some fans on a hot and humid night, which are the majority of summer nights in Nicosia. Where this place seriously lacks is the quality of service. The staff is nice but, even if one excuses their not knowing Greek, it is hard to excuse their lack of knoweldge about the dishes. They were willing to find out of course but we got the feeling that they just did not want to be there and we simply created trouble for them. We had to ask for water several times, they kept forgetting to bring it. and the extra ginger we ordered never came.

A rare combination if you ask me.Normally you might have your favorites if you order different maki rolls but what surprised me was that even though we tried many different dishes on the menu … all of them tasted as a minimum ""good"" and most of them were super tasty! The chefs are clearly trying to push the boundaries. Yes; you can go with the 'safe' options but i really encourage you to be a bit more daring ….. go off the beaten path and order something different. You will not be disappointed! Who could ever imagine that a Mango-maki or deep fired crab stick and smoked aubergine maki (yum!) could taste so delicious :). Or the Black Rain. It is all delicious, freshly prepared and portion-sizes are generous.And you know what the best thing is? I've only spoken about the sushi part. Where i think this restaurant really excels is on the hot plates. Especially the hot starters taste amazing! Pop Corn Shrimp, Peking Duck spring rolls or the Pork Buns .. all were yummy! We were so happy we were with a big group so we could try them all.In summary: Akakiko clearly tries to make you taste something different, something new! And whereas some places go over the top and create dishes that are not well balanced, here the balance is totally right. You wait in anticipation what the next dish will deliver. And you get to enjoy a nice setting where service is professional and friendly. So if you feel like sushi; don't miss out and find your way over!",Akakiko,Review 275 Similarity,0.40824829,,,,,"{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.71, 'pos': 0.263, 'compound': 0.9984}",0.9984,pos

82,10,"Wow, an award of excellence. They must be going cheap these days. I visited Akakiko for my birthday with a group of friends based on the recent huge advertising campaign for this place and other oriental restaurants being fully booked. When we arrived we had to actively encourage the service to find our reservation as they stood at the till talking, or just kept walking past us. Once seated we again had to ask for the menus after sitting there for roughly 20 minutes. When the food arrived, the starter platter of sushi was plentiful but I experienced something that I had never before seen (or smelled) anywhere. I don't eat sushi myself but my circle does, and it has never stunk before and I don't think that is normal. For myself I ordered various dumplings, one of which was supposed to be lobster. Either they were the blandest lobster I ever had (and I'm big on the lob) or they were a faux-lobster made of blended crab sticks with prawns. When the mains arrived most seemed to be quite bland and were not adequately hot (as in temperature, not spice). My plate of beef with broccoli was served in the water run-off of the meat and the broccoli was a foul frozen and boiled mess which retained the broth in the head and tasted like.. well I'll just say disgusting. Any beef was rump or a poor selection of tough meat and not suitable for stir fry. It was supposed to be a wok stir fry which I can make in two minutes at home for 5 euros with fresh ingredients, rather than a horrible mess of cold, yet melting vegetables and sparse and tough meat. The white wine we ordered was warm, the staff did not serve it, and at the end of the night, we practically had to beg for the check from the two girls, yet again, gossiping at the till. The best part of the evening was my cake, which we brought from a fantastic local bakery. Oh, and people were allowed to smoke indoors, which is against the law but the management clearly does not care.

The food was fresh and bursting with flavour and arrived at our table very quickly. If you are new to sushi and want to try it for the first time, this is a good place to start .

We dined without the kids, which was our first double date in Cyprus! (I think Prof and I should do these more often.)Our friend told us that a Korean who lives in Austria owns the Akakiko restaurant franchise, but someone in Cyprus brought the franchise here. Our friends are frequent patrons of this place, and we were treated like kings and queens at lunch.They offered several things on the house. It first began with jasmine and green tea served in clear teapots and teacups. The hot tea was a flavorful blend, which reminded me of my college years when I could fully appreciate tea drinking.The server brought another dish on the house – four bowls of miso soup. The miso soup had seaweed, sliced green onions, and tiny cubes of tofu mixed together. Knowing how much our kids enjoy miso soup, they would have devoured all four bowls if they were at lunch with us.We each ordered a plethora of bento boxes and hot dishes that satisfied our appetites.(Photos Above: Bento box with Bulgogi, Hot and spicy chicken (with go-chu-jang sauce), and Chicken with sesame seeds. Can you see Korean-themed elements in Akakiko’s food?)And when things couldn’t get any better, I received a dessert we split in celebration of my birthday.Second Lunch DateThen the following day, we made plans to eat lunch with another family from Piano Man’s school. Our friend suggested Akakiko for lunch, not knowing that we had already eaten there. Because Piano Man wished to dine at Akakiko, it was a natural fit to eat there for a second day in a row.Our friend ordered several amazing dishes and a huge sushi/sashimi/cali roll boat platter. There was enough food to feed the masses, so we ate until we could not eat another bite.Our friend’s hubby made it out to lunch for a quick bite from a busy day at the office, and we thoroughly enjoyed spending more time with them. They truly know how to enjoy life to the fullest. We talked about Indian, Korean and American culture, food, and everything in between. While I would have to say we ate more hot foods on our first visit, the second visit was about eating colder dishes like sushi and sashimi.I don’t eat sushi or sashimi, since I like my food cooked until it’s burned to a crisp, but our friend encouraged me to try it. It turned out to be pretty good, not too fishy or gooey as I would have imagined, but I think I still prefer my food cooked through.Our RecommendationAkakiko’s menu is filled with pages and pages of dishes. You could eat a different dish every night of the week and say you’ve never tried every dish on the menu. I wouldn’t recommend trying every dish on the menu because your waistline (and mine) would expand as far east and west of this side of the Mediterranean.I am pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant where you can eat some Korean food in Cyprus. We thought we would only be eating Korean food at home. And remember earlier when I mentioned that our friend said a Korean started the Akakiko franchise in Austria? If you know anything about how many of the Japanese restaurants are run in the U.S., you know or will find out that many of those Japanese restaurants are owned and run by Koreans. So it wasn’t all that surprising to know that Akakiko has many Korean flavors aded to their dishes. Just a little food for thought.By the way, after reading some reviews on Tripadvisor, there are mixed reviews about Akakiko. Some say the sushi/sashimi is frozen, which Prof said was true. Others have also said they ordered sushi for delivery, which turned out to be a horrible experience for them, but that just sounds like a bad idea to me. I don’t think any restaurant would be willing to give substantial proportions for take-out or delivery when they much rather you dine-in, at least that’s been our experience at some Japanese restaurants in the States. However, if you’re in Cyprus and have a hankering for Japanese food with a little Korean influence, then Akakiko is the place for you. Just remember to dine-in at Akakiko.We wished we had known about this place sooner in our journey in Cyprus. Wagamama is still a favorite in our household, but we have now added a new favorite Asian restaurant to our mix.

Although the menu was rather exciting in content, with a great variety of dishes, all the rest were just ok. We ordered both sushi and oriental dishes so we got the chance to try a bit of all categories, but no excitement in terms of taste! Everything just average with nice presentations.Service was okeish too, with kind staff but disorganised as we ordered a bottle of water to 4 different people and took them more than 15 minutes to bring it!!The dessert menu had a couple of choices, we ordered chocolate bites with coconut rice which gets excellent for presentation and creativity but in terms of taste was a bit plain.In terms of decoration the restaurant reminds nothing of asian/oriental as the decor is rather plain and mixed up!

Pillows are on the thin and hard side.Room 2/5 - spacious enough, no mini-bar to store stuff, clean, but not luxurious. There was a nail coming out of a bathroom tile - a potential danger. Poor noise isolation so you can hear neighbours. That said, they weren't a bother and I slept well, but it's potentially a problem. Despite booking.com stating I'd have a double bed, I ended up with a single bed, though it was big enough.Shower 3/5. Bathtub + shower (I prefer cabins). Weak water pressure, but plenty of hot water.Internet 2/5 - fast when it works, but drops every few minutes - very frustrating to use. If you rely on it, this is a potential deal-breaker.Food 3/5 - breakfast was simple but nice with good coffee. Very limited menu for evening food, but ordering out is easy.Location 4/5 - quite central, but city centre and old town are just out of walking distance. There's nothing within the immediate vicinity however. The area is quiet, and there's a mini-market right next door. Bus stop is close and taxis are affordable. Speak with hotel before arrival if you want help with airport transport - there's a cheap minibus which will take you there directly.Overall impressions:If you can get a good price, I'd recommend the place. I'd say it would be better value if they fixed the bathroom nail, water pressure and Internet (which should have been done as these aren't expensive investments). It would be a great place worth if they sorted the noise isolation, though that would be quite costly so I can't see that happening.It's far from perfect, but I had a pleasant stay and would stay again for the right price.

I arrived back at 12:00 AM after dinner with my business partner to hear alot of commotion outside the room and the room pounding from the music in the function room. Saying to myself this will not go on for much longer I tried to sleep but it was impossible and too late at night to move rooms. Eventually it must have finished at around 2 AM. I later found out that this was a graduation party. Next problem was that I was awoken at around 6 AM with bright sunlight pouring into the room as the curtains would not close properly. Not a good start to a business trip.Food is very good and Executive facilities also good with nice snacks and a 2 hour happy hour for HHonors and Exec room guests.Although didn't use the other facilities the pool did look very inviting.

Our limo-driver was arranged via Hilton Front Desk Mgr-Mr. Pambos S.- and was waiting for us !Highy advisable IMHO to arrange taxi via Mr. Pambos for pick up and return to Larnaca Airport as this guarantees reliable driver and correct price ( paid 55 euro LCA-Nicosia and 50 bck to LCA).Drive takes about 40 minutes from LCA airport to Hilton Park Nicosia .Hotel is located in quiet residential area , road in front of parking area does not create disturbing noises during night so even in room facing road sleep is not disturbed .On arrival at hotel :Entrance hall and large lobby are clean , airy and nicely designed. Good first impression ;)) No OLCI nor on line choice of room possible before arrival .Check in proccess on arrival at 02:00 AM was very efficiently done by very friendly staff member! We had received pre-approved upgrade as HH Diamond members but night receptionist really made us feel welcome and appreciated !!Second impression got even beter as there is a bell service present 24/7 and Yannis took us upstairs to our exec. room #205 !!Bell service was fast and informative for services in the hotel ... We requested delivery of international english newspaper- NYTimes- in mornings to room but only Cyprus Newspaper in English is available on site ; NYT is to be purchased by guest accross the road at off site newsstand .Room : executive room had nice lay out, 1,5 bath plus bedroom. We could easily unpack and store our clothing in cupboard with sliding doors , lots of hanging space and 3 drawers as well .Inside cupboard there is also safe as well as usual mini bar .Exec. Lounge :in all our Hilton stays as HH Diamonds this is first time that an Exec. Lounge -which is confirmed on Hilton website for this hotel -is actually not an enclosed lounge area with restricted key access . It is IMHO fantastic that managment here decided that Diamond / exec level guests at this Hilton can order without charge any non-alcoholic drink during the day or night in Amalfi Lounge Bar as well as outside at Sorrento Pool Bar !!From 6 til 8 pm there is also free-pour for alcoholic drinks which are to be served by staff from bar.There is no self-pour for alcohol as is usual in most European EL's but we do not drink any alcohol so did not try the ""happy hour"" .Choice of EL food :This is the only minor point we had during our entire 6 night stay :Executive Lounge Breakfast is only served in Olympia restaurant buffet style (plse read my review of Olympia Restaurant on Tripadvisor for my comments on breakfast buffet )There is a menu in Amalfi Lounge Bar with special page for EL guests which is presented instead of usual EL offerings.This menu provides only 4 cold choices : plate with cheese , plate with meatcuts , mixed plate with meatcuts and cheese or plate with smoked salmon . There is also a small plate with sweets as dessert.There is no usual EL ""Afternoon Tea"" serving sweets (cakes, pies..) nor savoury sandwiches between 3 and 5 pm . After we mentioned this to several members of staff Mrs Eleni Z., executive housekeeper ,offered us savoury sandwiches and fruitplates which we received on wednesday and thursday afternoon at 5 pm.This exec. lounge is also sadly missing the usual choice of hot food,salads ,sandwiches ,bread,fruits etc offered between 6 and 8:30 pm in a regular exec. lounge at other Hilton's and according to Hilton standards .This adds about 30 -50 euro per day to the budget, paying for dinner for 2 .We have paid in Amalfi Lounge Bar for our own club sandwich and philly cheese steak sandwich on our last night as we were fed up going out to eat our dinner in restaurants around the Hilton ! Both items were delicious, very well prepared by the kitchen staff !It is a shame that the GM does not yet offer these and other hot food items on a daily, rotating base to his EL guests who choose to stay at the Hilton Park Nicosia instead of the Hilton Nicosia. The other Hilton in Cyprus however does have a full EL with afternoon tea and with evening food offered according to Hilton EMEA Guidelines!The lack of normal Executuve Lounge food choice for the Diamond /executive level guests is the ONLY reason this Hilton Park Nicosia does not get a perfect 10/10 - or higher- score from us .We can only hope that the GM , Mr. Evros S. , and Louis Group as Hilton franchise holder, does tweak the food offerings in the EL a bit before our next stay in September ;))Pool area : big , well kept pool with life guard on duty from 09:30 till 6 pm .Lifeguard also provides the bathing towels to Hilton guests so if you swim before or after the hours that a life guard is present you have to take towels from the room !Non-guests pay their entrance fee to these life guards who seems to have a hotel room list with names of residing hotel guests. We guess that last week about 85 % of the daily pool guests were locals from outside the hotel but there was always enough room to swim and sunbathe without any problems.Bar service is at Sorrento Pool Bar : we went to the bar for our order and carried it ourselves to our chairs , the staff is friendly and seem mostly to be seasonal workersHousekeeping :in one word : FANTASTIC ! This department gets the highest score from us as the rooms are perfectly clean on arrival and even inside the drawers there is not one speck of dust ! Cleaned under beds and sofa, cleaned on the terrace and even the ashtray outside got emptied almost every day !!We already complimented Mrs. Eleni Z., the exec. housekeeper , in person during our stay but she and her housekeeping dept. really deserve our extra mention as they kept our room perfectlycleaned during our entire stay !!!! Score 12 out of 10 !Check out :as HH Diamond's we got late check out at 1 pm ( instead of 12pm).Quick and friendly check out with correct review of our bill with front desk clerck,Great stay which gave us a good first impression for this Hilton which we certainly will use again as our ""residence"" when we return to Nicosia for a 2 week stay in September.",Hilton Nicosia,,,Review 459 Similarity,0.402270223,Review 169 Similarity,0.31814238100000003,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.9982}",0.9982,pos

Drinks are free for the diamond and gold members from 6pm-8pm/18.00-20.00. The hotel lounge was just like the lobby: lots of natural light with modern decor.

Same for the staff at the front desk and at breakfast. 2) The gym is spacious and exceptionally well equipped, probably because it’s also used by locals. Fantastic!

I feel bad for forgetting their names but a special mention goes to the 'lady in charge' of the bar and breakfast, the young barman and an older lady at the reception.Lovely pool area with extensive and well kept gardens and a lovely contemporary wellness area with indoor pool, steam bath and sauna (Check it out! It's worth it but many people don't seem to know it's there...).The building is a bit older but the lobby and common areas have been renovated recently in a contemporary style. We liked it! The lobby is quiet impressive and unexpected when you arrive at the hotel.The breakfast was incredible and the staff kept on bringing us little treats. The ability to enjoy our leisure breakfasts outside on the terrace with the view of the gardens and pool was so nice. A large choice of quality foods and I loved the 'local products section' because this gave me the opportunity to taste local foods that I otherwise wouldn't have had the chance to try (I loved all of them!).

Thankfully the process didn’t take long and we got to our room in no time.The rooms were clean and comfy. The bathroom, though small, included the essential. We asked for extra soap twice.We opted for the breakfast buffet and it was nice and eclectic. There was a section that included traditional Cypriot food like olives, pastries, halva, etc.I thought the hotel was well located, though it was 15 minutes away from the conference center that I had to attend. There’s a McDonald’s right next to the hotel, a mega supermarket a little further, and if you keep walking there’s a Papa Johns Pizza and a Jamie Oliver restaurant. There are also coffee shops and restaurants across the hotel. We didn’t try any of those food outlets but rather opted to dine at the hotel. We had dinner once at a Cypriot/Greek restaurant attached to the hotel (you need not go outside as there is a door from inside) and on the third night we tried the Asian/Japanese restaurant also at the hotel.

They were able to provide me with everything that I requested with great pleasure, and trust me I can be very demanding :)We had a few meetings before the wedding so as to finalize all the details of that day.When the day arrived, we went to the hotel after the church. Members of the hotel staff were waiting for us at the door to take us to our room provide us with everything we needed and guide us on what exactly will happen through our day. Mr Christos, was with us through the day, guide us to the pool reception, provide us with drinks during the reception, direct us back to our room and then to the wedding dinner. He was always there from the first moment until the very end of that beautiful night and he was always able to provide us with anything we needed in no time.Our guests enjoyed both the cocktail and the dinner menu and we got astonishing comments for everything.Thanks to all the staff we had the MOST amazing experience on our wedding day. That day will remain unforgettable to us FOREVER!Needless to say that I haven’t visited or requested offers from any other venues in Nicosia.I believe that the most appropriate venue for a WONDERFUL wedding in Nicosia is Hilton Park, book it and you will not regret it!I had the wedding of my dreams and I could not have done it without you!!Thank you all for everything!!",Hilton Nicosia,,,Review 633 Similarity,0.302613766,Review 373 Similarity,0.13074409,"{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9917}",0.9917,pos

The staff plays blasting, Ibiza night club-style music all day long around the pool, starting from the morning, even before they open. They made sure they have enough speakers around, no escape. When you ask them to lower the volume, they ignore you completely. I addressed this at the reception desk, I got a lot of rolling eyes and a standard answer (probably I will receive for this review as well), 'thanks for bringing this to our attention, we will have a meeting with the staff'. The next day, next week, everything is the same, loud music, ignored by the bar staff. When I e-mailed them about the same, they never answered my e-mail although they read it 53 (!) times - thanks gmail mailtrack -, only after I sent a reminder that I am waiting for an answer. The answer was meaningless, 'thanks for bringing it to our attention ... '. At the end I moved my membership to The Landmark and I am happy there, the Staff is professional and they have a good idea about customer expectations. Please note, I never stayed in any of their room in Hilton Park Nicosia, I only had a membership and visited the place daily for 4 months until I gave up. Perhaps the rooms are nice and the beds are comfy - and if your room does not have a window to the pool or you can ignore the loud music, I am sure you have a chance to relax in the rooms. Location is mediocre, it is definitely not 'in the heart of Nicosia' as they advertise it - don't take my word for it, google maps will tell you. The center of the city is indeed close enough, after all the city is a small city with 250.000 residents - like Chandler in Arizona or Norfolk in Virginia - so how far anything can be? The Landmark is in the city center, or Cleopatra is even closer to the center, I recommend those ones before Hilton Park.

The beds and linens were great, the room size was generous and had lovely views of the pool and surrounding area. The wi-fi could be much better, not acceptable in this day and age.My favourite part was the outside area. A large pool interspersed with tree and flower sections was very pretty. There were plenty of beds available although when we arrived mid Friday afternoon, most loungers and their accompanying tables had left over cups and glasses from previous guests. It was very warm but the sky was looking stormy so not many guests were outside - hence the pool staff would have had time to put in some housekeeping activities! Disappointing. However, the next day was bright and sunny and all the areas were well prepared and attended to regularly. There is a shaded children's pool with a guard attending at all times. The outside bar is very pleasant with cocktails and a variety of drinks available plus good quality light meals. Plenty of shade available if the weather's too hot. The salads were excellent. An area off to one side (away from the pool area) was being prepared for a wedding. It was beautifully laid out and all the gardens around, well manicured.The lobby area is large and airy and the staff pleasant.

John was fantastic and really made us very welcome and couldn’t do enough.Breakfast is really lovely with lots of choice and special added touches like the Cyprus corner and a drink or food product of the day/week.Rooms are modern with big tv on wall and very clean.

Good pool, friendly staff, good location with a short drive into the center. I have also stayed at the Hilton Nicosia on several occasions and while that hotel has the same facilities and a dedicated exec lounge I enjoyed the overall experience more at the Park which often has slightly better pricing. There is now a kind of exec lounge which is part of the bar and was previously missing from the hotel but it is a bit confusing as to what is on offer compared to other standard lounges. I suggest this should be made clear at check in or by the staff/notice in the bar on arrival to avoid any confusion. Paid WIFI is still an issue at Hilton hotels but if you are a member they are now offering it for free. Maybe the chain will wake up to the fact that all guests expect this in any hotel as standard these days but that is their corporate decision and not that of the individual hotel of course.

The atmosphere is what you expect from a chain-style restaurant, shabby-chic-rustic, clean and well organized. We had the three course set menu lunch and it was more than enough food and the price was good. I really had no complaints but I think that some people are expecting something that Jamie's isn't; a Michelin star restaurant where Jamie himself cooks. It's a nice place to eat, on par with The Hard Rock and Friday's, with good food and good service and decent prices.

986,10,"I visited the restaurant with a friend as we were curious to try it out. We arrived, gave the name of the reservation and were immediately seated outside. At the first instance, what my friend and I said is that the outside area was too noisy. We could hardly hear each other. The waiter came and politely gave us the menus while announcing tonight's special. What I had noticed from the menu is that the selection of items is small but adequate to satisfy most tastes. I chose the spaghetti nero (black) with seafood and in fact pointed to the food with my finger when the waiter was taking the order. My friend had the burger which she requested well done but the waiter said it only come in one way (the chef's way apparently). When the food came some time later I noticed that my spaghetti was white, not black. I called the waiter back to say that I had ordered something else and his response was 'I repeated the order to you'. Indeed, he had but it was so noisy I could not hear him and never actually said that the order was fine (my friend had, I just commented that I had no idea what he said due to the noisy background). I then politely asked if I can send the wrong order back and he said the kitchen is too busy right now! So I asked him, what am I forcibly having then? He replied fresh crab spaghetti. I like crab so I said ok although I was disappointed as I really wanted the black seafood pasta. From the first bite I could tell the pasta was too dry, it was so dry it stuck together! I presume they must have cooked it in advance and it got stuck. Overall, I was far from impressed, could have cooked better pasta at home. Then when the bill came I noticed the crab pasta was more expensive that the one I had ordered (and pointed!). Not only did the waiter bring the wrong plate without apologizing, he didn't even offer us dessert (as compensation) or at least allow me to pay the price for the food I had initially ordered!

1004,30,"Having the privilege to live and study in the UK for almost 6 years, i was daily 'slammed into' the world of the most beloved British chef; Jamie Oliver. Seriously he was in abundance like baked beans. Literally though he was everywhere and he kind of passed his ideology on food to most British i knew. Don't get me wrong on this ok, i often catched my self watching him on youtube for hours. But enough with the intro lets get down to his 'temple' of Italian cuisine. First of all Jamie's Italian as a franchise does really well both in the UK and in Europe. However here in Cyprus it was well adapted in our culture and for me it lacks this Italian finesse; not in the atmosphere, which i rate it 5 out of 5, but in the food. I know as Cypriots we are a demanding sort of people. But hey, this is after-all an ITALIAN restaurant. Get rid of the steaks and burgers and the chicken fillets. Go on with some crazy panzerotti, or calzone, more pizzas or even crack on with some stews (which are not authentic Italian recipes but they can better serve you than a burger); and to be honest if i wanted a burger i wouldn't bother coming to Jamie's Italian. In any case, service is quite moderat but quite smiley hostesses make your way to the huge and awesome dining area and make you feel warm, as it should be. Speaking of budget, dishes are a bit overpriced, especially when it comes to antipasti. Come on its a salad, a tasty salad, but still a salad. Same goes for pasta which is tasty as well, impressed by mezzaluna, but a bit overpriced. Finally i would like to give my best credit to the subtle detail given to children's food which is rather impressive and i respect that.Overall, a moderate dining experience for the name of one of the most infamous chefs worldwide.",Jamies Italian,,,Review 101 Similarity,0.263523138,Review 209 Similarity,0.260377822,"{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.9957}",0.9957,pos

While the interior design was lovely and the food was fine, the overall experience was disappointing.The initial vibe of the restaurant was more TGI Fridays than sophisticated and classy. There were many large families with loud and disruptive children, their squeals echoing around the hard floors and artisan interior design.Our experience was not helped by the fact we were located on a small table in the middle of the walkway of the restaurant next to the bar. This meant that we had a constant stream of people walking by us and putting their butts in our faces and dinners (including the staff). There were other tables in more quiet and relaxed positions but alas we were not so fortunate to get seated there.I did really love their artisan bread box and glad to see the excellent local Zambartas wines on the menu. Our mains were perfectly fine but certainly nothing to rave about. The service was average too, serving our dinner within about 2 minutes of ordering it so our whole dinner experience finished in about 1 hour.When our mains were served we were keen to get drinks to accompany them. By the time we managed to get the attention of our waiter, order drinks and have them delivered we had finished our dinner. They then asked us for coffee. Not sure I know of anyone who enjoys their coffee with a cold glass of white wine.Keeping in mind this is a local restaurant for us, would we go back?!

Alas when seated we noticed that there was a speaker above us blaring out Country and western music (well that is what it sounded like to me) . I had to ask twice to have the music turned down. Maybe I am fickle but I would expect Italian music in an Italian restaurant. There's wonderful pop and folk music produced there just as I would expect Indian music in an Indian restaurant..The food generally was OK. i ordered Chicken Milanese. I didn't have a clue what I was ordering and unlike the others who went for the steak(they said it was OK) I chose something at random. I'd describe it as cardboard dipped in flour, egg and crumbs. Maybe it was overcooked or was cooked twice. Even I can make a better chicken schnitzel. I was forced to break the fried egg and spread it to make it palatable. The green salad had no dressing. The other chicken dish was average. I am use to going to a wonderful Italian restaurant in New Zealand where Jamie is hoping to open a restaurant in Wellington. La Strada has recently closed in Whanganui. The proprietor had to sell it for health reasons. A pity as it set the standard by which I judge other Italian restaurants by now. I must say that the tattooed young lady who served us was a wonderful host. I still think that restaurants should have quiet spaces in them where conversations can happen.

The latter proved slightly expensive for Cyprus standards, but it certainly beats the commercialized meals offered at any other renowned chain restaurant. All meals were well-presented, portions were adequate and more importantly, served in a timely manner. Highly recommended is the Black Angus steak, chargrilled with truffle butter, shaved truffle, balsamic onions, drizzled in a creamy wild mushroom sauce.

The restaurant in my opinion is not in a great location and took us a long time to drive through all the traffic lights from Debenhams (about 30 minutes) and this was at a quiet time of the day. However, interior of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful, a lot of money has been spent on its appearance.I had the meatballs which did not remotely compare with those in UK - these were made from pork and were dry and tasteless. We had to ask for parmesan.Good to see both Italian and Cypriot wine on the menu although it is overpriced - a rather mediocre white at Euro 6.5 per 175 ml glass is more than we normally pay in decent restaurants in Cyprus.Staff were pleasant but some looked rather confused; training is still in evidence.Hopefully things will improve and we will give it a few months before visiting again.",Jamies Italian,,,Review 378 Similarity,0.27386127899999996,Review 203 Similarity,0.0,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.7814}",0.7814,pos

1114,30,Today 5/12 was my mum's birthday.She made it to 90.So I decided to give her a treat thinking that Jamie's Italian in Nicosia might be a good choice.That was about the dumbest decision I ever made because the evening was a disaster as a result of the staff's incompetence and their inability to offer restitution.But let's start the whole sad story in chronological order.Three days before the event I went personally to the restaurant to pick a table.I was well received by a pleasant girl at reception and was offered the table I requested.I was quite pleased with myself but quite oblivious of the tsunami of blunders that were to occur on what was to be a special evening for mum on her 90th birthday. Cocktails arrived a little late but they were invigorating and tasty.As we were preparing to savour the vegetable antipasti platter we had ordered a young waiter arrived fast and furious bearing the main course of one fillet steak and Gennaro's chicken.We asked about our antipasti only to be told that there was a cock up in the kitchen. He then made the absurd suggestion to bring the antipasti later.We cancelled the veggies and concentrated on the maim course .Mother was struggling with her 30 Euro steak when I realised that a steak knife was not issued. We asked for one and the knife arrived promptly.But our torture was to continue.I soon became aware that the ''funky'' chips I had ordered were not so funky because they looked like roast potatoes.They got that one wrong as well. In a while they brought some soft and oily chips in an odd-looking container. I concluded they were the funky ones .I ate one or two and went back to the roast potatoes thinking that they were the better deal.We desperately tried to save the evening by ordering two glasses of wine.But they were nowhere to be seen.We were half way through our dish and no alcohol in sight to comfort us.The wine finally arrived following our protestations. All of a sudden a young man approached us and tried to offer what appeared to be an apology by waffling and saying nothing substantial.I gave him a piece of my mind but he continued quite undaunted by my negative commentary of the restaurant.I could not but smile in the end and that encouraged him to come up wit this priceless gem. .''Sir when you leave this restaurant i would like you to wear your best smile''. I could not believe my ears and responded with a vengeance.''The only thing that would make me smile would be if you step on top of our table and performed an oriental dance.''What a memorable evening!,Jamies Italian,,,Review 111 Similarity,0.226455407,Review 240 Similarity,0.0,"{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.786, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.3251}",0.3251,pos

1155,50,"I've visited Elliniko many times in the last 6 months. I waited until now to write a review because nornally all new restaurants try their best at first until they are established and then they try to cut costs on the expense of the quality and quantity of the food. This is not the case with Elliniko. For six months I noticed that the food was improving while the prices were not changing. For example the smoked pork was a bit salty and gradually they managed to control the amount of seasoning. Additionally the quick lunch menu was a nice surprise with a variety of dishes, meat, salads, poultry paying aproximately 9 euros per person and have a full meal.The food is really not expensive. The secret is that you have to be careful about the amount of food you are ordering. The menu has an incredible variety of dishes and it can be confusing. First time I visited the place with my wife I paid around 30 euros per person and there was plenty of food left untouched. I had them pack it for take away and my wife and I had it for lunch the next day and there was still leftovers. Next time I visited, I asked the waitress to help me with my ordering and the bill was approximately 15 euros per person and still had a small amount of food left on the table. Bottom line ASK THE STUFF TO HELP YOU.The stuff is mainly young people acting exactly how I like to be treated as a customer in a greek taverna. Friendly but also professionals. Attentive but also discrete. Well done boys and girls!On the downside the place can be really noisy and crowded during the weekends and people who like peace and quiet should prefer visiting the place during the week. Additionally they should consider adding more options for desserts.Overall I believe that this is a restaurant that fits my needs and I hopefuly they will continue maintaining their high standards.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio,,,Review 198 Similarity,0.36597765600000004,Review 41 Similarity,0.39056673299999994,"{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.9525}",0.9525,pos

As part of our wedding we therefore wanted to organise a dinner (a day before the actual wedding) at To Elliniko for 60 of my friends. Spoke to the owner beforehand to discuss a budget and gave him freedom to create a menu that would suit locals and foreigners.From the moment we entered drinks arrived at the table and soon after the food came out. It was simply delicious. The starters to share were so good .. my friends kept on raving about them! Then the mains arrived and again people were so happy. The quality of the meat was sublime ; not dry at all and perfect in taste! The chef has really taken the Greek cuisine and put his own mark on it without losing any of the traditional elements. He must be so talented.What surprised me most of all was the consistency of the dishes and the way how logistics were handled. Every dish arrived at the same time at the table, looked stunning and tasted the same....for me it is mind-boggling how the chef and kitchen managed to deliver such high standard for such a big group of people.I can't thank the waiters, staff, chef and manager enough for adding such a special touch to our wedding!I will return , maybe not with such a big group :)) ...

1195,20,"The location is easy accessible. Plus it's a positive fact that it is not directly adjacent to the main road and parking is easily accessible and free which is not the case in Nicosia anymore as many parking spaces are unfortunately privatized. The interior design is suitable for a Greek mezze place, the waiters are polite and attentive and there is a good display of gourmet products to purchase if desired. However it would have been nicer if there is a bigger variety of products focusing more on Greek produce or from Thessaloniki region which directly relates to the food instead of yet another place that also sells Cypriot produce. A further speculation and study on the products provided for purchase. In regards to the food which explain the poor-rating is that the portions are very sufficient for a mezze but the quality of food is very average. We would rather pay the same price for their dishes, but have a smaller portion and invest more in the quality of the ingredients used. The flavor component needs a lot of work to be satisfactory. We felt that it was lacking a lot on seasoning, the use of Mediterranean herbs and good olive oil. We also felt that some of the components of the dishes were prepared a lot of ahead of the serving time and were just assembled therefore not as fresh before they are to be consumed and for the amount of people in the kitchen this did not justify it. They were well executed in presentation but the quality has a lot of faults. It has an interesting menu and an interesting choice of dishes put up together so we would really like to try out more of the dishes but for the meantime we won't be going back until we hear from word of mouth that the quality and freshness of food has elevated itself. Also if we compare to a lot of the new pop up local restaurants in Nicosia, for the price we paid, we can get better food, better quality and more quantity elsewhere. We couldn't finish all the dishes because they were huge portions for mezze and at some dishes it was unnecessary to have such a large portion especially when it's a dip as a starter, and this didn't give us the chance to get a more variety to try because of the expense and portion size of every mezze dish.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio,,,Review 206 Similarity,0.282528966,Review 77 Similarity,0.201007563,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9888}",0.9888,pos

It was always my understanding that mezze are small dishes, hot or cold, spicy or savory, similar to Spanish tapas. The operative word is “small.” The dishes I ordered were anything but small – but humongous!Before ordering, I was given bread and a small complimentary dish of potato salad with a light mustard dressing. I normally do not like potato salad with mustard dressing, but I found this version to be quite tasty and would order the appetizer version listed on the menu (€5.50) if I were come again.For what thought would “small” dish appetizers, I ordered the Armenian pastourma - highly seasoned, air-dried cured beef (€5.50) and an order of pan fried fresh mushrooms with cognac and balsamic vinegar (€6.50). This would be followed by my “main course” of horiatiki – a country style salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, olives and feta cheese (€7.00). I also ordered a 650ml bottle of domestic Keo beer .When the pastourma arrived, there were 8 pieces on top of a huge amount of what appeared to be politiki – a cabbage salad with carrot, celery and red peppers. This was surely enough food for 2 or 3, after all, I expected this to be an “appetizer.” The pan fried mushrooms were hot and very tasty. I would have ordered another if I didn’t already have the pastourma and the horiatiki salad was still to come. The horiatiki salad, like the pastourma was quite large, enough for 2 persons sharing.The offerings were tasty and the service was fast and efficient with no mistakes in my order. I could only finish the mushrooms as the two other plates were large. My waiter offered to put the remains in a take away container.

The food on offer is generally traditional dishes with a contemporary/imaginative flair.A tomato and green chilli dip comes with the complimentary slices of crusty country bred.The Village Salad is crispy, properly dressed and comes with very large slices of excellent fetta cheese (creamy and fresh, not the variety that curdles your stomach). Our starters were delicious - cheese baked in filo pastry and drizzled with honey, fried courgette balls (kolokithokeftedakia) oozing with Greek aromas and fresh mint, served with a yoghurt dip.We were so full that we shared a main of grilled calamari.
