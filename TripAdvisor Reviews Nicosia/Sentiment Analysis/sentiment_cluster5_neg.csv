0,30,It's one of those strange things that some of make a point of visiting the sites of horror around the world. It's fairly clear that a terrible event did occur here many years ago. The museum is very small and not really easy to find. It's best to employ a taxi driver to find the location. It makes no pretense that it is presenting a balanced view of what occurred there - I don't think that they feel the need to do this. It does simply present information about an historical event and then allows us to make up our own minds based on whatever information we currently hold or are able to garner from a range of sources. Go and have a look - it is definitely worth it.,Museum of Barbarism,"{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.2553}",-0.2553,neg
2,10,My father was the British RSM RAMC that was in charge of bringing the bodies out of the house. He said that it was so quiet if a pin had dropped there would have a horrendous uproar and he does not agree with the story written here. He read it in the daily telegraph many years ago and was upset as it was not written as it was and he was there. This affected him more than Burma,Museum of Barbarism,"{'neg': 0.123, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8446}",-0.8446,neg
3,10,"This 'museum' is located in one of the busiest and trendiest streets of the Turkish speaking part of the city. It is a crime scene of a family whom were killed in the shower by Greek speaking soldiers during the Cypriot Civil War in 1963. The building is currently under Turkish Military control, and has a lot of biased information on the war (whitewashing what the Turkish speakers did and putting all the blame of the war on the Greek speakers). There is a similar museum in the Greek speaking part of the city with a lot of biased information and propaganda too (this time putting the whole blame on the Turkish speakers and whitewashing what the Greek Cypriots did.).

One of his colleagues then said, because I look Chinese and the “floor manager” still refused me at the table.Then I asked him: “You are refusing me play here because I look Chinese, so this is racism and discrimination”Your so-called “manager” couldn’t properly deny my accusation.In short:- I'm not being refused on grounds of being aggressive, disrespectful, rude or disturbing to anybody- I'm being refused only based on my looks, not my nationality.

33,20,"I've been coming to the hotel restaurant for several months because the food is excellent, the staff is very friendly, and the prices are very economical. Today, however, I have had the poorest experience yet, and it had nothing to do with the aforementioned positives.A man appeared to be very upset with something, and started berating the staff loudly, throwing a temper tantrum with his (apparent) very young daughter at the table. My colleague and I were tempted to go over and step in to calm the irate man down, but decided to eat our food instead.After we finished our lunch, and when leaving through the lobby, we saw the man sitting at a desk by the front counter. We approached him to talk to him, but he apparently did not speak English. We spoke to the counter staff instead, who informed us that he was the owner of the hotel. This made his actions previously even more deplorable in our eyes, as it appears he was actually berating his staff for some perceived slight.While he is of course entitled to deliver feedback to his employees regarding mistakes made, or procedures not followed, to do so in such an aggressive, loud, obnoxious, and unprofessional manner in public, in front of paying customers does not add much to his credibility as a manager. I would suggest that any future potential customers avoid upper management as much as possible, as we have never had any problem with the frontline staff. If this review is ever brought to the attention of the owners, I say, put a sock in it, and treat your staff with respect, and they will do the same for you.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino,"{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.7362}",-0.7362,neg

They just do not care if you lost thousands or hundreds, do not sit on their table more than 30 minutes. In any case generally customer service is crap.

The rooms are beautifully-appointed with comfortable beds and large bathrooms. The food in the hotel is delicious, both breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet is full of delicious foods--amazing. Unfortunately, no one in the hotel speaks English, and the service is terrible.The first morning I was there I ordered breakfast through room service. Scrambled eggs were on the menu, but what arrived was some kind of bun with a some kind of smoked meat stick. I tried to tell the room service person, and she became very upset because she did not speak English. The hotel refused to give me the conference rate (i was invited to be a plenary speaker at a conference, which was why I was there) unless I got a letter from the organizers stating I was at the conference. When they finally agreed to give me the rate, they cancelled my original reservation, which caused Booking.com to charge me 95 Euros. I asked them to email them and explain what happened and they refused. I never got my money back. Staying at that hotel was one of the most stressful experiences I have had traveling. Restaurant service was unbearably slow, and often the order was wrong.
