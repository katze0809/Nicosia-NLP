61,40,"If you do a tour of the Old City of Nicosia, make sure to pass by the Famagusta Gate, one of the gates of the Venetian Walls still standing today. It has been transformed into a cultural center where you have events and exhibits. There were none when we visit it but the exterior of the building is the big deal. You can still see the souvenir of the fights Nicosia knew in its history (bullets inside the walls).",Famagusta Gate,"{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.935, 'pos': 0.021, 'compound': -0.4404}",-0.4404,neg
78,50,This old gate was a little bit tricky to find and no one seemed to have heard of it either which was rather surprising when asking for directions. It stand in a road rather isolated with businesses and building work going on around it and now looks a bit out of place. It is still very much in tact and the largest of the gates by far.,Famagusta Gate,"{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.031, 'compound': -0.4062}",-0.4062,neg
83,20,According to our guidebook it should have been opened at 4pm but they did not. Some German guys with their guidebook also faced the same situation. From the outside it is nothing special (cf. picture).,Famagusta Gate,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.438}",-0.438,neg

114,30,"not overwhelming! Interesting to see Sultan the Magnificent's Signature on the top, but apart from that, not more impressive than many other gates of its kind. Ok, we were not there at the right time to go through the tunnel to the other side. Maybe some other time;but overall Nikosia (or Levkosia, as the Greek call it), is run down, disappointing; to be a divided city does not help, for sure.So much renovation necessary; re-unification would surely allow the city to bloom again, for both parts.

Especially as the narrow entrance from the outside part of the wall, widens to become three large halls with 3 separate exits into the old city.Most of the time you will find an expo going on, be it photography, artworks or even books.Beside this gate, there's another one, more modern that hides behind it the statue of the Poet by Varotsos, which was given to the city of Nicosia by the artist.

142,10,"I was expecting a bubbly veggie moussaka, crackling with energy and smacking of flavour - there was none of this with the meh offering served up by the uninterested staff. It was the last wedge of the tray that had lasted days probably (given the lack of customers) and the microwaving only made it hot. The salad was tired and had little in the way of dressing (and no extra was offered). For 11.90 euros I expected a lot more. The women on duty were only bothered with gossiping together in the kitchen. It was long way to walk and to fork out a small fortune for such a miserable lunch.",Ingas Veggie Heaven,"{'neg': 0.146, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.018, 'compound': -0.9136}",-0.9136,neg

178,10,"Having read a good review in a newspaper, I decided to give Inga’s a try, as I was in my vegetarian week and also in that area. I went for an early lunch, short after midday. Either bad food choice or bad day, but my experience was negative: tasteless food and food poisoning! My symptoms were dizziness for several hours and mouth sore. Inga’s oral menu doesn’t have many options. No written menu, only some dishes names and price on the blackboard inside, and among them, some they didn’t have. From the 2 or 3 oven-cooked dishes, I chose shepherd’s pie (peas not cooked enough, lentils etc; also pie not heated enough). The salad that came with the pie didn’t have walnuts – the lady forgot to add them. No soup (apparently, the reason was the hot weather in that particular day). Juice was ok. While I was there and just before paying my bill, it was only one person cooking, taking orders and serving at tables – multitasking that obviously didn’t work well. I’ll never go again.This was my experience and I wrote this review on the same day I dined there, but didn’t have time to up it.Inga’s veggie “heaven” (what a joke!) is located inside the walls, in old Nicosia, on a narrow street, easy to access by foot from Famagusta Gate corner (Melina Mercouri Hall) where you can park the car.",Ingas Veggie Heaven,"{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.9317}",-0.9317,neg
