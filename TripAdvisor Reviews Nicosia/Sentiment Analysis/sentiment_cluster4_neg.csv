I am sure if i had ignored it and took a bath or used the jacuzzi (it was a jacuzzi-bath) the leak would go all over our room and outside of the suit. Because of the late in the hour that we realized this we didn't request for a change in the room but we notified them the next day and they said they will check it.Since we stayed only for one night we didn't have the chance to see what they would suggest we do (change room etc).Nevertheless after this experience i don't think i would ever take my chance with this hotel again because i highly doubt that the leaking first occurred on our visit since as soon as we opened the water, water started coming to the bathroom floor without any delay. This is not something that the cleaner could ignore during their regular cleanings of the bathtub, the cleaner should have realized that it was heavily leaking and either ignored it or told the responsible person about it but instead of them to arrange for it to be fixed, they just let more people to stay there.
