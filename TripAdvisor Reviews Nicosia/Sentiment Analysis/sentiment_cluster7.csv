0,40,Located in Nicosia. You can find make almost your own burger with serval options available and also they served other plates and different kind of salads. The service was good and the waitress was friendly. The burger with gruyere cheese and onion was tasty and juicy. We paid around 16 euros per person including soft drink.

10,30,"Entrees: 4/5 - these were done well. I had the turkey-brie entree salad which was large and delicious. The only negatives were it had almost no brie (why not just say it includes brie along with the other of many ingredients rather than call it a turkey-brie salad?) and that there was a small turkey bone present. My fiancée had an artisan hamburger and called it one of the best they have had. The side of fried vegetable chips was also nicely done.Dessert: 2/5 - we were both excited to order the 'brownie hamburger' which was supposed to be brownie with vanilla ice cream. Most places do this combination very well, but it was an utter letdown here and more of a basic ice cream sandwich. The brownie was a frozen cookie and both parts were far from fresh. Aside from the fact it wasn't what we expected, we have honestly had much better frozen supermarket desserts.Service: 2/5 - not really sure what went wrong here. Very slow service who would not check on us for absurdly long periods of time despite it being fairly empty. Language may have been an issue, but it did seem like a fairly English-speaking location. In any case, after taking and providing our initial drink orders in a friendly manner, it was a long wait for meal orders, and after that we were never asked how the food was or if we wanted more drinks (we did). After a very long delay we had to wave them down for dessert (which seemed to be a surprise) and we decided to skip the bottle of wine. When dessert ended up being a letdown, we told them the entrees were lovely but dessert was not. The response was a bit chilly and indifferent, so we decided it was time to ask for our bill (which again took forever to get).

37,30,"We visited this restaurant for a Sunday lunch and predictably it was full of families. The décor is very indifferent with subdued colours and light wood that would be more suitable at an office than a restaurant. The menu as others have said is made up of burgers, salads, a few starters of the kind of chicken wings and stuffed mushrooms and what is described as alternative burgers which includes vegetarian, chicken and seafood burgers. We skipped starters as we saw how huge the burgers going to the other tables were and ordered burgers and sides of potato chips and onion rings. The burgers were delicious and cooked medium as ordered. The sauces were nice and the vegetables fresh.They were in a brioche type bun that was not fluffy enough. Brioche buns go stale really quickly and should be baked several times in a day.The onion rings were very thickly cut and came under cooked, the onion was practically raw. The potato chips were fresh but average as they were not really crispy. A side sweetish sauce that was offered was indifferent and I am not sure what it was meant for, as it was not suitable either for dipping the fries or the onion rings. My main criticism was the price of the drinks. It was sky high and much higher than in any bar, never mind restaurant. Euro 5. 80 for half a litre of Stella is ridiculous (incidentally the menu refers to pint but in reality is a half litre which is about 15% less than a pint) and it is irrelevant if holders of certain bank cards get a discount. That discount should not be subsidized by other paying patrons. I had a look around and most people had one drink each and nobody lingered after finishing the meal as obviously ordering second drinks would break the bank but also maybe in part due to the place not being very cosy.

Simple but well crafted. In the center, there is a bar and there is also an extensive outdoor seating area.I have been at Artisans about 5 times and suprisingly the quality and the flavours are better every time. At the beginning the burger toppings were modest and the fries were soggy. In my last visit, the burgers were perfectly cooked, the toppings were abudant, the fries were crisp and the salads were fresh and flavoursome. Were a group of 6 and we chose burgers number 1, 2 and 9. Burgers range with unusual toppings such as pancetta, caramelized onions, gruyer cheese, spicy mayo, blue cheese, figs, goat cheese, roasted peppers, rucola, wild mushrooms and more. The result are about 10 signature burger proposals with a fresh take on burgers. The meat used is of the highest quality. Simply delicious.Not of the same quality, the fries are average. Sometimes the ratio of crisp to soggy ranges. When the place is packed, it so happened the fries were soggy. Last night, they were ok. Besides burgers there are side dishes, salads and some other alternatives (chicken, fish etc) for the non burger fans.Each burger inclusive of a side does not come cheap: €11-15. Inclusive of drinks and maby a shared starter expect to pay €20-25pp. Overall this humble staple deserves its price.

127,20,"My previous review of Artisan's was glowing. Unfortunately, now the novelty has worn off, I have to address some shortcomings. We visited yesterday, a party of 3, ordering two chicken burgers with guacamole and one veggie burger and delicious (because cheese) portobello mushrooms for appetizer. The veggie burger looked too black, as if it was fried, and was merely unappetizing. The chicken burger was dry, only saved by the guacamole texture (but not flavor), which might as well be store bought. We wanted to get a jacket potato as a side, but for the 4th consecutive visit were denied, since it is the ""only"" thing on the menu they don't have. When you don't have something for 4 visits, please take it off the menu. When we asked what red wine they had, they didn't bring out a menu, but told us the name of two wines, a French and a Cypriot. I asked again what kind of wines those are, and got again the names of the wineries. The Cypriot wine ended up being another variety than that we were quoted (cheaper and lower quality), so we ordered the French, which was a Merlot. Now who likes Merlot? The choices were minimal, either cheap Cypriot Cabernet Sauvignon, or French Merlot. I tend to like their Beef Burgers, but this time I went for the healthy choices, and it was not worth it. Also a decent wine menu would greatly improve our wine choosing experience. I want to like this joint, but yesterday's experience was particularly eye-opening.

157,20,"I will be frank. I liked this place. But not really! This is because the persons that owe it (not the gkarsons) have never heard of the sentence 'consistent quality'. I will explain you why:When it first opened this place I was among the first ones to visit it and try what they offerred in hamburgers and other plates. I was amazed by the hamburgers but, most of all, it was the handfried french fries that did it for me! They were the best, most tasty frenchies I had tasted: and they shouted 'HOMEMADEEEEEEE'. My second visit was equally good with nicely selected burger and still the best fries on the country. Take note of my third visit though: I ordered Burger No. 5 (pesto/brasil I think) and I was very much looking forward to have my excellent fried - instead of getting what I used to what did I get? Pre-fried french fried!!! Like the kind you buy from the supermarket!! I didn't say anything, nor to the gkarsons, nor to my wife. I just finished my meal, paid (my god, the prices!!!) and left.I gave them one more chance: I went there 3 weeks after and ordered the burger no. 7 with fries. AGAIN PRE-FRIED!!!!!!!!! And the worst part? The couple next to me where having the HANDMADE type, the one I feel in love with!!!!!!!!!!!!! I asked them to try one of them and they allowed me: it was them!!!!!! I made a complaint but the lady gkarson couldn't help me as she said that that's how they came out of the kitchen!!!!!!! I can't understand why a simple matter as that of the quality of a side dish cannot be upheld!!! Why did you accept to compromise your standards when people from all over Cyprus where visiting you on occassion of your lovely fries? Well, I have news for you people: LITTLE DETAILS SYNTHESIZE THE BIG PICTURE!!I'm sorry to be so frank but I had to warn fellow eaters so that they know the 'before and after' situation of your fries. In such difficult times you either do your best or you dont have the right of asking the customers to be regulars. Forewarning: shape up and return to your roots.

161,40,"Visited this restaurant on a Saturday late afternoon. As expected there were only 2 tables and we were the 3rd one at the time. This made service really quick. But in addition the 2 waiters working at the time were really helpful and offered to help us with the menu and they were really friendly.i am only noting the above to make it clear that my review on the service is clearly related to the time we visited.The food was quite good. The burgers and the salad we tried were really really good. it's been a long time since we have tried such a tasteful burger.Three issues that i would like to point out, hoping that they will be adressed by the management are the following:1. the side dish(french fries) were of really low quality. Over cooked and really oily. This messed up the whole burger flavor. Simple detail to take care of, but essential to the whole dining experience.2. the outside table that we were seated was covered with dust. I understand the whole concept of outside seating in a hot city like Nicosia, but there should be some extra attention in keeping the tables clean for the customers.3. We ordered a grilled chicken salad dish. Unfortunately the chicken was boiled and then grilled so it had that taste of chicken soup in it. I have seen that happening in many places in Cyprus. I guess that's a way to save time and keep chicken tender, but this has to be mentioned on the menu. When a customer orders grilled chicken this is what he must get. Not pre-boiled short-grilled chicken.Anyway, the overall experience was good. The prices are really reasonable and one could even say they are cheaper than expected.I would definately go back and highly recommend it to anyone. I expect that the minor issues above will be adressed.

After our recent visit last week I realised the reason why we hadn't visited all these years..We called them for a reservation since it was Saturday night and they told us that they only had tables outside, but we agreed since we were planning our visit long ago. Indeed, the place was full and we were offered a table in the corner of the outside seating area.We had to wait about twenty minutes to place our order, since we were waiting for them to come to our table and eventually we had to call them ourselves. The options in the menu are adequate even for those who don't like the classic beef burgers. The waitress was friendly and helpful and proposed to take a starter or replace our extra sauce with the onion rings which included the same sauce (the difference in price was only 70 cents) and take them as a starter, since they had a lot of orders and it would take a while for our mains to come. We agreed to the second option since we were very hungry.The onion rings were tasty, and not long after, our burgers arrived. Their impressive presentation whetted our appetite for them even more. However, once we had our first bite, we got a bit disappointed; the caramelised onions in mine were not that good and the cheddar cheese sauce spoiled the flavour of the whole dish. Also, my grilled vegetables (as a side included in the price) were a bit raw for my taste. My boyfriend was not that happy either with his burger; the crispy pancetta could be barely eaten.Overall, the burgers in this restaurant are not that special, so their excessive price cannot be justified.",Artisan's Burgerbar,Review 263 Similarity,0.272165527,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.4224}",0.4224,pos

You also get to choose the bread although this is no main attraction unless you are super concious of your diet in which case just dont go there.I believe that the menu needs a stir though but overal is a great place for an expensive burger.

263,40,"I quite enjoy this burger bar and have dined various times when in Cyprus.The burgers are a little bit expensive but the food is good and well presented. I must admit that they make a very acceptable effort but I would like to see some more exquisite flavours after all they claim to be a 'gourmet' burger bar! why not try White truffle oil with truffles topped with a little foie grass for instance? or a surf and turf style burger with langoustine with pure Aberdeen Angus beef ...or with a whiskey pecorino infused cheese! or a shrimp wasabi burger! The ideas are endless..My favourite has to be the crispy pancetta and gruyere cheese with BBQ sauce with mash potato and creamed parmesan because most of the other burgers involve feta and halloumi. This is too Cypriot and needs a little more class in it's flavours NOT ENOUGH CREATIVITY OR INNOVATION! The other nicely balanced burger which is tasty I found must be with the caramelised goat cheese, roasted bell peppers, thyme and chill mayo.I did not like that every single burger is topped with tomatoes and after travelling to this country so many times found that Cypriots put tomato literally EVERYWHERE and are obsessed with this fruit. No doubt tomatoes are delicious but many dishes can do without! Why not decorate the plate with a few plum tomatoes instead, as topping them up this way constantly only ruins the presentation and can make a burger look soggy and unrefined.I did also not like the menu which uses only numbers, I would like to have seen beautifully descriptive ones instead! I believe this is due to the lack of waiters intelligence to remember which burger each customer is referring to....The biggest let down here are the deserts which are ALL accompanied with another Cypriot obsession; ice cream!The cocktails are terrible and even the apple martini is made with apple liqueur and non of them use any kind of fresh pulp!This is a place to go when one desperately misses a different kind of burger but not to be impressed.Overall it is better than most places in Nicosia and I would urge you to give it a try when in town...not much else to compare this category.",Artisan's Burgerbar,Review 164 Similarity,0.105409255,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.9817}",0.9817,pos

Not this place.

I always order my burger medium rare, so once it came medium to well done and another time half of it was medium rare and half of it was literally rare.The decoration is simple but modern, a clean environment which lets you enjoy your burger. Even the toilets were literally spotless.I would easily rate 5 stars if not for the price. It doesn't come cheap. The price range of $11-16 in the TripAdvisor description is very optimistic. If one wants to order the cheapest burger, fries and a coke it will cost $22.5Of course it's understandable that good ingredients and rent cost, but a coke at 2.9 euro, 6 times more expensive than on a supermarket shelf is ridiculous.

But then, as we have ordered chicken with cashew nuts he said that this specific dish is not very nice and that he ll bring us something else (a sizzling chicken dish which was more expensive! thankfully it was tasty).We ordered an appetizer starter which consisted of 5 different appetizers which reminded more of indian cuisine rather than chinese.

Only dish that needed that extra punch of salt was sweet n sour chicken. Otherwise everything was deli. Service was exclusive of course since we were only people there. However, since quality of service is a word that the restaurant industry in Cyprus just doesn't get I would like to point out that the Philippino Greek speaking waitress was immaculate and so was the Greek waiter gentleman. Hey, they even treated us with fried banana and ice cream in the end courtesy of the restaurant. Employees of the month? Yes! Best Chinese in town?Yes!

We rang a French restaurant in the town, and the owner told us they were closed, but highly recommended Sawa and said this is where she and her husband go for the best fresh food in Nicosia. A recommendation from a restaurant owner seemed reliable, so we booked a table and went this evening.We had a fantastic time. Everything was superb: the food was all freshly prepared, plentiful, and extremely tasty. A particular hit was the fried aubergine, which was melt-in-the-mouth. The mushrooms in breadcrumbs stuffed with feta were fabulous, as were the cheese pastries. It was all terrific. Wine was also very reasonably priced, and high quality-we drank local wine, which we enjoyed very much.Another real bonus was that they bake their own bread in house, and we were lucky enough to be seated next to the bakery area. We had a great time watching the Baker, and he responded not just with delicious bread but, at the end of the evening, two pittas in the shape of hearts!This gives some indication of the really outstanding feature of Sawa - its staff, who were among the best restaurant staff we have ever come across in a long history of dining out around the world. Not just the Baker, but both men who waited on us were professional, friendly, and generous at all times. They made it a real pleasure to be there in addition to the fabulous food.

642,30,"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed with the Venetian walls of Lefkosia (Nicosia). On any map of the city, the circular but slightly odd star-like (or snowflake-like) shape of the wall lulls you into a sense of thinking that the walls something magical, a great stone construction that defines Nicosia and provides an amazing tourist attraction to its visitors.The walls form a border around Lefkosia’s Old City, and were built by the Venetians in the 16th century. They were built of mud brick, with only the lower part buttressed by stone. When the Ottomans occupied Lefkosia, they repaired the walls and covered the upper part with stones. The walls were fortified by eleven heart-shaped bastions and protected by an 80-metre wide moat. Five of the bastions, Tripoli, D’Avila, Constanza, Podocataro and Caraffa, are in the southern sector of Nicosia (Lefkosia). The Flatro Bastion on the eastern side of the Old City is occupied by Turkish, Greek Cypriot and UN military forces. The remaining bastions, Cevizli, Musalla, Cephane, Zahra and Kaytazağa, are in North Nicosia (Lefkoşa).The reality of the walls being a major feature of the city is somewhat overstated, from a tourist point of view. Whilst the walls are still largely intact (apparently), they are in places really difficult to see and appreciate, and carparks. the bus station, and various constructions seem to blot out the grandeur of this fortification, (or example the new modern entrance to Ledra Street at the D’Avila bastion where the Town Hall, and a curious glass sculpture, is located. You can’t walk around the walls in its entirety, as the Green Line and the eyesore that is the buffer zone prevent a complete circumnavigation of the wall. There are no crossings on the wall between Lefkosia and the Turkish-occupied north. The moat no longer exists, and is now used for playing fields and carparks.In Lekosia I followed the road on the top of the wall as far as I could, from the Pafos Gate in the west, to the Green Line in the east, just beyond the Caraffa bastion. The best spot to really see and appreciate the grandness of the construction was on the stretch between the Podocataro bastion and the Caraffa bastion, where you’ll find the Famagusta Gate. Here, the sheer height of the wall, and its solid construction, are clearly evident. Walk down Plateia Archiepiskopou Makariou, so you can look back up at the walls, as it’s a really good spot to appreciate the sheer strength and enormity of this Venetian construction. The walls seem to be really well preserved here. The two ‘gates’ which I’ve mentioned - the Pafos Gate beside the Kaytazağa Bastion, and the Famagusta Gate at the Caraffa bastion deserve more than a cursory glance, and I’ve reviewed them separately. The bastions are built upon, with public buildings, mosques, and the occasional grand statue (the Liberty Monument on the Podocataro bastion is interesting).In Lefkoşa (the occupied north) it was even more difficult to get decent views of the Venetian walls; I saw a stretch by the Kyrenia Gate which was nicely preserved.See what you can, and enjoy!",Venetian Wall of Nicosia,,,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969,pos

681,50,"(May Allah have mercy on his soul) is a local researcher and a great admirer of Nicosia, his hometown. In his book “Nicosia of Yesterday and Today” he skilfully and accurately describes the historic walled city, her neighbourhoods, ancient monuments, old houses and gardens etc while he paints a vivid and detailed panoramic view of the modern present day Nicosia.Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, who bought Cyprus from the Knights Templars, who had bought it from Richard the Lionheart, brought many noble people from Europe and Jerusalem to the island to whom he allocated land that belonged to the Orthodox Christians of the island. The indigenous people became serfs under the feudal system introduced by the Frankish rulers, with hardly any rights. Nicosia was proclaimed the capital of the Kingdom of Lusignans. In due course the ruling class amassed a huge wealth, a great part of which was expended to develop the city architecturally. A lot of palaces, mansions, monuments, hundreds of churches including Saint Sophia Cathedral and monasteries were built. The Lusignans also surrounded Nicosia by walls with gates as the part of the fortifications of the city. However the Venetians were not impressed by what the Lusignans had done for the city as they wanted to control Cyprus for purely military and economic reasons. The island’s strategic position enabled them to dominate all eastern trade routes and Cyprus was also a rich source of good timber for shipbuilding, an important asset for a maritime state. So the Venetians were more interested in increasing the defensive capability of Nicosia in case it was attacked by the Ottomans. Therefore they destroyed a large number of the original Lusignan buildings including about 80 churches to construct new fortifications which they thought would stop the Ottoman army from conquering it.During the Lusignan rule when a group of pilgrims were on their way home from the Holy Land they came to the island as well and visited Nicosia. The King was very welcoming towards them and he provided them with decent accomodation and also gave them a gift of one hundred fowls, twenty sheep, two oxen, four vessels of a very good red wine, four skins full of a very good Marboa wine and plenty of very good white bread. The French nobleman Orient D’Anglure notes in his memoirs that four days later, on 9th January, the King sent them presents again including one hundred partridges, sixty hares and five wild sheep. The generousity of the King is an indication as to how rich the city had become albeit at the expense of the local people.Although Nicosia was surrounded by walls it had many gardens that were planted with citrus trees such as lemons, oranges and pomegranates; grapes, vegetables and potates etc. The gardens were irrigated with water drawn from wells. A large amount of land was also available to grow grains such as wheat and barley. The walled town abounded with cypress and date palm trees. However the wealth of Cyprus in general and Nicosia in particular decreased by a substantial amount during the Venetian rule as 2/3 of the tax revenue was sent to the Republic of Venice. The state of the city was not any better during the early years of the Ottoman rule. Although the Turks built a number of inns, baths and fountains and new bazaars and introduced improved handcrafts such as weaving and leatherworks that helped the town to continue to be a commercial centre it actually took many years for the city to re-capture its glorious Lusignan past.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia,,,"{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9951}",0.9951,pos

The walls were never quite completed and the city fell to the Ottoman siege in 1571.Since English colonial times, the walls can be crossed over in many places, unlike when they were built when everything was esoteric, and walks in the inner city are truly picturesque, to say the least, revealing of the rich layered history of the most continually inhabited city in the world, of over 4500 years.Of the original gates, the most visually attractive is the Porta Giuliana - or Famagusta Gate having been preserved and restored in its original glory.To be able to see the whole circuit of the city walls and float in and around the 24 Parishes of the mixed culture and religious native history, you will have to cross over into either the Republic of Cyprus sector or the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (internationally unacclaimed but nonetheless real) so have your passport ready.Points of interest in the inner city vary, whether you are into architecture (eg. Famagusta Gate in the South sector, the Frankish 11th century St Sophia Cathedral known as Selimiye Mosque in the North sector, or churches and restored houses and mansions in both sectors, to name just some of the many worthwhile structures), museums or churches/mosques, sightseeing with scenic routes of narrow streets, or small shops and cafes/restaurants.Planned routes can be found in either side's tourist information offices, but make sure of the opening times beforehand.",Venetian Wall of Nicosia,,,"{'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9925}",0.9925,pos
