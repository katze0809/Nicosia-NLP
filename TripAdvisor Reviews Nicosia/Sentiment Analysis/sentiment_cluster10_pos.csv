The ground floor of this place doesnt have many tables ... most of it is on the first (internal) level, which I found very interesting as it reminded of a loft of some kind. We opted to sit upstairs and immediately the very gentile waitress came to suggest an aperitif, which we took. A kir royal. Which was not bad at all but could have been better if it contained a tiny bit more of crème de cassis. But that is just a matter of personal taste.The wine we had was a anju, 100% cabernet franc, rare in the wine world, but a variety I personally prefer.Starters: onion soup gratinee (for my wife) frog legs (for me) and a salad with warm goat cheese and bacon (for both). The last one was meant to be kept for the main course too. All of them 3 plates were satisfying. My wife absolutely loved the onion soup and she could not help picking some of my delicious crunchy frog legs in garlic sauce. Salad was good, nothing out of the ordinary... I had better.Main course: Steak tartare. Me and my wife, are steak tartare lovers and it is plate I usually prepare at home for her, rather than the opposite. I had a speical request for the owner which she so kindly accepted. To bring me all the ingredients and let me mix the meat with them, so I could control the exact amount of quantity I wanted for my tartare. Meat quality was good but not excellent, but I have to admit is difficult to find good beef appropriate for steak tartare in Cyprus. Most of the time I get it from wholesale merchants from New Zealand, Uruguay and Argentina.Overall I would give 75 out of 100 for the eating experience (of the particular plates I had) at this establishment. To be honest I got more than I expected and I will surely return back to have some more of the dishes on the menu and have a better and perharps more fair idea for the place.The only negative thing I found was the price...

The salad was plain romain lettuce cut in stripes with the knife with 4 pieces croutons with chevre cheese gratinated with parmesan and some cubes ham. The cheese croquettes were more like potato croquettes you could roughly taste the cheese inside. The frogs legs where nicely cooked, but with no taste.

Corner shop on a small neighborhood, nothing special as far as the looks and the view is concerned.We were welcomed by the owners. Great couple, happy and really friendly. We immediately felt comfortable.We got the kir royal to drink through the reading procedure. Really nice way to start a dinner. The owner helped us a lot with the menu even though she was busy with other tables.We got French snails and the salmon quiche for starters along with a salad. We expected more taste from the quiche but that's all. Everything was very good.For mains we got the duck confit and the beef bourguignon.My wife really liked the beef. Great taste, it looked good and the portion was quite good.I was a bit disappointed with the duck confit. It's served with potatoes cooked in the duck's fat that delivers an explosion of taste in your mouth. But that was it. A plate with a piece of duck and some potatoes. I was expecting some more eye satisfaction to be honest. The duck was cooked perfectly and I totally enjoyed it but the dish lacked imagination.We of course got deserts. The creme brulee and the cheesecake, and we were not disappointed. Try any of the 2 or both for sure!Prices are quite good for a French restaurant. We didn't get steaks or mussels or expensive wine so the bill was fairly good for what we had.Overall I can easily say that it is a great experience and we will definitely return once the restaurant moves to its new location.I had some reservations for giving 5stars but the great service, the help we got with the menu, the relaxed ambience and the eagerness of the owners to suck feedback from the clients reassures me that my comments were and will be heard.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir,Review 125 Similarity,0.339556515,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.733, 'pos': 0.232, 'compound': 0.9977}",0.9977,pos

The onion soup although fresh almost seemed like it was from a tin probably because something was missing in the recipe to create the unique french style my case buds are accustomed to...for Cyprus standards I must admit it is very good overall especially when they host Opera nights and stimulate the ambiance...makes a classy change from listening to annoying silly Greek music everywhere I go most ridiculously in Sushi bars.This restaurant keeps a higher standard than most.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir,Review 86 Similarity,0.317011479,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.7, 'pos': 0.226, 'compound': 0.9915}",0.9915,pos

This is not a problem if you get the set menu, but individually I believe it is. I am not disappointed at all, but I think they could be a little bit bigger (e.g. octopus)2) In my opinion ceviche should be cured/marinated a little longer in citrus juices in order to get the texture right. Other than that, I enjoyed this plate to the maximum!3) Orzo should have been cooked 0.5-1 minute less. Again it was fantastic as it was.4) It would be nice to update your menu provided online in order to match the actual menu on site.5) Please don't take my comments/recommendations as bad.

It was a lot for two people though so better go hungry or order less :) One negative comment I have is that even though we booked well in advance-almost 20 days-we were given a choice of two not well located tables-I realize they wanted the central ones for larger groups but still, an early reservation should guarantee a better spot....",Vino Cultura,Review 135 Similarity,0.0,"{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.212, 'compound': 0.9548}",0.9548,pos

426,20,"We were recommended Vino Cultura by a friend. We went at around 8pm on Saturday night. When we walked in we asked the guy at the front of the door if we could eat he asked sternly ""Do you have a reservation?"" to which we replied ""No"" he response ""The Bar"" and pointed. Charming. The restaurant was around 20% full and did not get any busier whilst we were there.The bar staff whilst being very friend were very slow and it took a long time just to get a drink. We looked at the menu but after the way we'd been treated we decided to leave and go somewhere else.The venue it's self is very nice and I am sure you could have a nice evening there if you're allowed to actually sit at a table.",Vino Cultura,Review 208 Similarity,0.0,"{'neg': 0.009, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9511}",0.9511,pos
