Paid for by work and I wouldn’t have been happy if I had paid for it.The staff were accommodating but communicating to them wasn’t easy.If you want a short and sweet visit, one or two nights, I’d recommend this hotel.

The room was perfect, it had a nice double bed, a desk, wifi, a bar fridge, big closet, a balcony, and air-conditioning, everything I needed.The lobby has a nice large breakfast area, there food was included in my booking. I ate there a few times, but there is also a nice taverna around the corner (large chicken kebab is about the size of my head and the Swordfish was awesome.) The area is slightly out of the downtown center but it was 5 minutes from all my meetings by cab, so as a business traveller it served its purpose well.The staff where so friendly, even when the kitchen was closed, they got up, turned on the lights and made me food. I never had such a friendly experience from people, usually they just tell you its too late, but these guys where great. I particularly liked their Cypriot coffee, they know how to make a good Cypriot coffee. Walking distance was a corner store, pharmacy, hair cutter, and a restaurant.There is a little balcony with chairs that catch the evening sun set on the mountain range and has nice wicker chairs with cushions to sit on, such a pleasant place to have coffee and a puff of a small cigar. I slept fantastic, because there is no noise in this neighbourhood, its quiet and really a lovely find for a work-traveller.I actually returned from my trip in May and decided to stay again.

Albeit not luxurious, the Crown Inn had everything we needed and nothing was too much for the team to organise for us. Harris prepared a tasty lunch and Svetlana set a lovely table. Internet access in the rooms was much appreciated as were the services of the electrician, who restored the lights to my room after a mighty thunderstorm. I'm already looking forward to coming back in the future.",Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.9436}",0.9436,pos
58,50,"We found the hotel by looking for good prices for an unscheduled stay. Was pleasantly surprised on every level. Exceptional value, great facilities, good location. They even have adapted some rooms for the disabled. This meant my elderly father was able to be comfortable, safe and independent in his own room. Loved the fact that absolutely every room has a balcony and nice views!The staff really couldn't be more helpful and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The manager is very hands on and is supported by happy staff with a can-do attitude.The biggest surprise of all was that this is only a 2 star hotel - in the UK it would be 4 star. Can only guess that it may be because they don't have a gym or offer full board? That said, they produce hot or cold snack meals all day which is surely what most visitors to a capital city want!",Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.729, 'pos': 0.242, 'compound': 0.9881}",0.9881,pos

66,30,"I paid 45 euros in off-season, early March 2012. The woman on duty Sat. night and Sun. morning was a treasure house of information, clearly conveyed in good English. She was terrific. Breakfast was excellent, a nice choice offering eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, etc. A full breakfast in a very pleasant room. But--the room was small and tightly arranged. Bathroom by contrast was huge. (However, there was the hazard of a slanted-up entry of a few inches into the bathroom, tiled the same as the bathroom floor. I put a T-shirt there, to remind me, or I would have tripped repeatedly coming or going--as I did the first two times; not safe for old people.)Very quiet place in a very quiet suburban neighborhood (at least one taxi driver couldn't find it on his own). I left after one night because it is so very faaaar from old town, which is where everything is located that a tourist would want to see. You either waste a long time walking back and forth, or spend at least 15 euros round trip for a taxi. Better spend that money on a centrally located hotel, such as Centrum or Rimi, both of which I stayed in next and enjoyed them both.",Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9738}",0.9738,pos

71,30,"I was made aware of this hotel from a list provided by my conference organisers. My stay did not begin particularly well. I arrived at noon on a Saturday to be told that it was the chef's day off so had to manage on his pre-prepared sandwich (lunch) and Greek salad which I stored in my room fridge for dinner. Breakfast was very basic as well with the only major ""fresh"" options for much of the time being eggs (scrambled) or eggs (fried--sunnyside up) in addition to cereals, cheese, cold meats etc. Food that I ordered separately was well made and in good quantity.The staff is generally friendly and obliging especially in calling organizations/entities that do not converse in English on one's behalf.The rooms are very basic as well with the linen clean but old. The bathrooms are tiny with even less space in the shower section. The TV carries mostly Greek channels. I loved its very intimate baclony where two people could sit at a squeeze which gave a good view of life passing by.Prospective visitors are advised to take a good supply of drinking water Like other hotels in Nicosia (including the /4/5 star hotels) one has to buy bottled water at rates that are higher than the market rate.This is on the whole a homely inn for visitors with small budgets.",Crown Inn Hotel,"{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.9592}",0.9592,pos

It was in decent shape, everything worked well, it was clean, but the furniture seemed to be a little older (incl. canopy bed) and the room felt a little muggy.
