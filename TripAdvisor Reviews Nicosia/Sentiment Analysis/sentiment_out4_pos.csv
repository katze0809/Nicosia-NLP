24,50,"The church of Archangelos Michail Trypiotis, a three - aisle Franco - Bysantine basilica, is located within the Walled City, in the south part of Lefkosia, in a quarter which had been rich and important before the division of the city. The church was built in 1695 and the beautiful wooden carved iconostasis dates back to 1812. Constructed with clearly cut stones, the church has distinguished internal features and very important icons. Most impressive is the big icon of Archangelos Michail, protector of the city from flooding by the Pedieos river, dated 1634. Exceptional is the 15th century small rectangular icon of Mary with baby Jesus in her arms, between her parents Joachim and Anna. This is the most ancient icon in the church. Very interesting are the two doors on the southern and western external walls, since they follow different architectural styles, such as romanesque, gothic and renaissance.You may visit the church early in the morning or afternoon at about 5 o´clock and certainly every Sunday morning before 10 to attend the orthodox divine liturgy. The best season to visit Trypiotis and the other 10 churches, orthodox and catholic, of the south part of the Lefkosia Walled City, is Easter time, especially on Good Friday.",Archangel Michael Trypiotis Church,"{'neg': 0.009, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9844}",0.9844,pos
