It's really on its own in a residential and business area so actually very easy to drive to and park. Watch out the location on TripAdvisor as it was wrong as on 15 June (reported). The correct address is Vasileos Pavlou 7, 1096 Nicosia near the Ministry of Economics and runs off Grigoriou Afxentiou.It's a relaxed, friendly and easy going place with great service. The waiters are super helpful and happy to help with any recommendations. The food is all local with a nod towards a modern twist here or there.
