734,10,"I've been in Nicosia for business purposes, and stayed in hotel for three weeks. Main impression - staff is very unprofessional, never would rate them as a 4* hotel. TWICE my personal belongings were TAKEN OFF BY HOTELL STAFF (minorly valued, but still that shouldn't happen in any hotel)! After both time I threat that I will call the police they returned them, otherwise I doubt that they would do so !!!When I approached the guy at the reception with my complains on this - he laughed in my face ?! ?! ?! On the top of the above - my company paid to the hotel more than 5500€ for their ""services"", so I can only imagine how they treat the customers that pay less ! Very very UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE which I wouldn't recommend to anyone.Beside these things with plunder of my personal belongings, there are other ""minor"" things I didn't like in this hotel:1. Half of the hotel is NOT REFURBISHED, so usual case is that you initially always get the room in the non refurbished part, so if you don't complain you'll be stuck in THE ROOM FROM MIDDLE '70s (again, we are speaking here about 4* hotel)2. BREAKFAST is every day the same, so after two weeks I stopped go there. Best thing they offer for the breakfast are the watermelons, but as nothing in this hotel is as it should be, they peal one water melon, and when it is eaten they don't refill the plate, so you have to go very early in the breakfast if you want to catch the full meal. This is the case with almost everything offered for breakfast (at least for decent stuff).3. STAFF that works in the dining room is mostly consisted of young men's (I'd rather say kids 15-20 years old ?!), who don't know how the service in a 4* hotel should look like, so when you ask them to bring you something (i.e. coffee, tea, etc.) they first turn around their eyes making ""a face"" and then go to do what you asked for. After I saw this is the usual case I stopped asking anything from them in order to avoid spit in my coffee or something4. BEDS ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE! Generally there are no twin beds but rather two single beds placed next to each other acting as a twin bed. When you sleep they know to spread apart and you can find yourself on the floor. Beside this they are very uncomfortable, so many mornings I woke up with the pain in my neck, my back and in my shoulders.Bottom line is that I will certainly avoid this hotel in the future, which I recommend to the other as well, because for the price which is equivalent to the prices of 4* hotels in London for instance, this level of ""quality"" and ""service"" is at least 20 levels below!Finaly, after my initial comment on TripAdvisor website I was threaten by the hotel owner that they will press charges on me for my negative rate and my comment ?

Sadly it only has a small number of these and the reality for most is a 1980's style bedroom. I had 2 rooms on this visit due to a broken door. The first had a modern bathroom but the 2nd had an old fashioned affair with a cracked toilet and a shower that had to be hand held to have any chance of the water hitting my head. The air conditioning unit left much to be desired - roaring and banging through the night. Like many Cypriot hotels this one has an ironing room. Sadly it is closed between 7pm and 7am - which is of little use to a hard working business traveller. I had to fight for it to be open after 7pm on my 2nd night after being reduced to nothing but my pyjamas as everything was too creased to wear.

1836,50,"The Paphos (Pafos) Gate is one of three entrances which were built into the historic Venetian walls which enclosed the old City of Nicosia The other two gates are the Famagusta Gate at the eastern end of Lefkosia, and the Kyrenia Gate in Lefkoşa, at the northern end of the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia. I have reviewed each separately, as they all warrant a visit in their own right, for different reasons.The gate, constructed in the 1560s, was so named because the road from this gate led to the coastal town of Paphos in the west of the island. If you’re within the walls of Lefkosia, walk east along Rigainis or Arsinois, past the Tripoli bastion, and you’ll come to the gate. If you are visiting the Cyprus Museum, you can’t miss the walls and the gate looming as you walk up Mouseiou from the museum. Architecturally it’s probably the simplest of all the gates - no more than an opening in the stone walls roofed by a barrel vault. It’s merely a pedestrian passage these days; part of the Venetian wall beside it was opened up to allow traffic to pass in and out of the old city. At the time of my visit you couldn’t walk completely through the gate; to see the statue of Markos Drakos and to get to the Cyprus Museum (both outside the walls), you had to follow the traffic exit.But to me it is its surroundings which make it a really interesting place to visit. It’s at this gate that the Green Line and the Venetian walls intersect, though you cannot cross the Green Line here. Entering along Rigainis you’ll see the stone walls on your left, and as the road dips, what looks like an unused observation / control box on the right. It all looks a bit intimidating, a bit forlorn, but there is no problem continuing down the hill to the gate on the left. The intimidating feel continues as you look at the gate; there’s the graffiti-covered Paphos Gate police station on the top of the gate, and a forbidding, desolate barricade of blue and white concrete drums. Turn around, and with the entrance to the gate behind you, you’ll see the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church on your left. You can visit the church. Whilst it’s interior is fairly unremarkable, what is particularly interesting about the church is that its facade and front entrance is in Lefcosia, but the body of the church juts into the Turkish controlled occupied north. Apparently the church can continue to operate as long as the back door is kept firmly closed. As you exit the church, look to your left and you can’t miss the barricades of the Green Line.Enjoy you visit here. It’s a good insight into the reality of a divided city, And in many respects, there’s no ‘gate’ here which actually signals a unified city.",Paphos Gate,,,,,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.908, 'pos': 0.043, 'compound': -0.3103}",-0.3103,neg
