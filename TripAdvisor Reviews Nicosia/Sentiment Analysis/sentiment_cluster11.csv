We have also travelled to it, both by car and on foot having crossed at the Ledras Street crossing.Every time has been a really personalised experience. On an island crammed full of massive resort-style hotels, there are few places that give a really traditional and intimate experience. The Swallow really is one of those that does. It is a very good place to stay for exploring both sides of Nicosia.Special mention must go to the breakfasts, which are some of the finest I've had in Cyprus.I am 100% certain that the next time we are in Nicosia for a weekend getaway, it will be the Swallow we stay with again.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.938, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.8258}",0.8258,pos
5,50,"Cypriot Swallow Hotel is situated in a superbly renovated building and has 3 rooms that open onto an internal courtyard. The whole interior is bright and cheerful, it has been charmingly decorated, is full of plants and interesting objects and feels very homely. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean. We had the Bougainvillea room - the room itself was not huge but there was a good sized wardrobe and drawers and we also had a small private entrance lobby which gave us quite a bit of extra space. There was a fridge, kettle air con, hairdryer etc - everything you need. The double bed was comfortable and the wifi was good. The bathroom was well equipped and plenty of hot water in the shower. There was a little noise from the street during the evening but it stopped about midnight and didn’t cause us any problems. Service was good although we only met one member of staff - Dudu gave us a great welcome, plenty of advice, and helped us find a parking space for the hire car. There was no private parking and we had to park a couple of streets away so were sllightly worried about the hire but everything was fine. It was no problem to leave our luggage for a few hours after check out and come back for it later. The breakfast was amazing - a traditional Cypriot array of different cheeses, jams etc which were all freshly prepared and we could choose what time we wanted it. It is served in the courtyard if the weather is good or in the inside breakfast room if not. Location is good - it is inside the city walls in the northern Turkish part of Lefkosa; 3 minutes walk from Kyrenia Gate, and is close to the historical centre and the main attractions. It is close enough to the Ledra Street border crossing to walk even with a lot of luggage. It is easy to find when driving as long as you have a good map. Other people have complained about the area but we did not have a problem with it, it was poor but old and authentic and the people were friendly. The price was more than we normally pay but comparable with other properties so no complaint. We only spent one night here as a stopover before crossing to the south for the second half of our trip but would love to come back and spend longer another time.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel,"{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.751, 'pos': 0.165, 'compound': 0.9915}",0.9915,pos

7,40,"First please do not be put off by a recent Belgium reviewer because I find it incredible that anyone booking a hotel in N.Cyprus could be unaware of the turbulent history of Cyprus which has resulted in this divided island. Secondly I do not think it is unreasonable for any hotel anywhere to not refund for a booking if the booking is cancelled on the day of arrival and I think that the delightful owners had every right to do so.When we arrived in the area we were a little apprehensive because it really is in downtown N.Nicosia but when we turned the corner there was the hotel looking just like the photographs. We were assured that our hire car would be quite safe and it was. We were greeted by very friendly lady who served us with a very welcome cup of tea ( no alcohol served on premises ). I believe there are only 3 or 4 rooms in hotel and we were given the Jasmine room. Nice size with fridge & tea making facilities. Bathroom good size too but beware of door stopper sticking. Only complaint was because of the heat a sheet rather than duvet would have been more suitable and, as is quite common abroad, there wasn't a plug in washbasin. The aircon is quiet enough to leave on during the night. There is a lovely courtyard where smokers can imbibe, not so good to sit in if you don't. Breakfast is traditional Turkish and most people would find something that they would like, breakfast can also be requested to be served at particular times.

They will ask a fortune for that. We had to contact the hotel by pohone but each time youion may turn have to pay an international call, so a cheap hotel night will cost you very expensive.

We were flying out of Ercan on a 6.30 am flight, so booked a night at the Cypriot Swallow to allow for an easy 20 minute cab to the airport. We loved this place from even before we arrived at the front door. We walked with two large wheeled bags from the Ledra Street Border Crossing and it's do-able - but a taxi could have been warranted. The neighbourhood, like much of Nicosia is a bit grim - but the hotel is beautifully plastered, painted white and has teal accents - easy to see even from a distance. We received a warm welcome from Tudu on Reception and she made us lovely tea and biscuits, showed us our room (which was thankfully ready early when we arrived at 10 am), advised that the water, snacks and juice in the fridge was included in our rate, booked our 4 am taxi and offered to make us a sandwich and put it in the fridge so we didn't entirely miss out on breakfast due to our early departure. Phew - friendly efficiency at its finest. When we returned from sightseeing a few hours later, sandwiches were there as promised. The room was not large... two people, two bags, cabin bags and there was just some room to move about. The bathroom was actually half as large as the room. The beds were comfy, the linens nice. A lot of effort has gone into the clean, fresh, modern decorations and we appreciated it. A friend from the UK spits chips if she doesn't get a hairdryer and a full length mirror (even in developing countries where she's paying 20 euros a night). She would have been ecstatic here with dryer, mirror etc. The water had excellent pressure and was piping hot. We don't normally pay more than 40 euros a night to stay pretty much anywhere... so 60 euros was a bit extra for us - but - the inclusions, the warm welcome and flat out great service made the rate worth every penny. The taxi that Tudu arranged arrived spot on the dot of 4 am, was a clean and well maintained Mercedes with an excellent driver and the ride to the airport took exactly 20 minutes.

43,50,"Anyone reading through the previous reviews for Gul Hanim will be in no doubt that this is a very desirable place at which to stay. I can only endorse those sentiments: it's wonderful. But first you have to find it. My advice is to make for Kyrenia Gate, which is a key entrance point into the old part of town. From there, simply ask for the street name: Celaliya Sokak, which is a minor street off the Square. If the locals in the Square don't know it, ask staff at one of the cafes or shops adjacent to the Square, or in the Information Centre, located in the Gate. They can supply you with a map, and Gul Hanim is marked on this; the guesthouse is a distance of about 150m from the Square.Selay is a wonderful host: vibrant, knowledgeable and ever obliging. After I arrived,she spent quite a while pointing out on a map possible places to eat, and suggesting places to visit. Subsequently, she was also extremely helpful in directing me to buses, and transport nodes.The room I occupied was very comfortable: lovely furnishings, good bed, an excellent bathroom, good lighting. The adjacent courtyard is filled with succulents, as well as a couple of fruit trees. It's a delight just to sit here, and relax. Breakfast is laid out in a nearby kitchen - itself a beautiful room - and offers a good range, including superb homemade jams. However, there are no cereals, which I would suggest should be added to the offerings.

68,40,"The Kyrenia Gate (it may be noted as the Girne Gate) is one of three entrances which were built into the historic Venetian walls which enclosed the old City of Nicosia. It’s located in the northern part of walled quarter of Lefkoşa, the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia. The other two gates are the Paphos Gate at the western end of Lefkosia, and the Famagusta Gate at the eastern end of Lefkosia. I have reviewed each separately, as they all warrant a visit in their own right, for different reasons.It's a little squarish, squat construction, built between 1562 and 1567 from stones of the former medieval wall which the Venetian walls replaced. The little square tower on top, and the dome, were added in 1821. There's a stone panel on the building which records the date of its construction, and also a table inscribed with some verses from the Quran.It was a part of the continuim of the Venetian wall, until the British demolished sections of the wall around it in 1931 to facilitate the flow of traffic. What a shame, as the gate now stands isolated in the middle of a dual carriageway. The surrounding space has a number of significant statues, and is a bit of a focal point for gatherings and political rallies.Today, the gate is put to use as the Tourist Office of Nicosia Turkish Municipality. It was thus named as from this point the road led north-east up to Kryenia (now Girne).It's very pleasing to the eye, and looked beautifully grand in the afternoon sunlight, with the trees behind and the mountains beyond. It's certainly worth a visit if architecture and local history is of interest to you - that's why I went. If you are visiting Lefkoşa (the norther quarter of Nicosia) from the south, you'll need to head north from the Ledra Street Crossing, through Ataturk Square, and along Girne Caddesi to the gate.
