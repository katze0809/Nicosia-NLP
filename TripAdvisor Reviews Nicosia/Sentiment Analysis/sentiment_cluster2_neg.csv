1,10,"the Asty is a bad bad bad hotel. without a doubt the worst ever. My night stay there was an ordeal in keeping my sanity as one thing went wrong after another. we called our travel agent on the phone and they were not surprised at what we told them. The area of town is very shady; esp at night. Guests or ""customers"" are going in and out of the rooms at all hours of the night ; there must be an hourly rate for the rooms. The A/C didn't work at all and the place smelled so bad it made me sick to my stomach. Yes the price is cheap - but you are getting what you pay for and the dump rates only 1 1/2 stars. Oh what a wonderful feeling it was to get into that air conditioned cab and pull away from the curb of this nightmare.",Asty Hotel,Review 326 Similarity,0.236066843,Review 262 Similarity,1.0,"{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': -0.6347}",-0.6347,neg
3,20,I had the night from hell as we came in very tired from a long bus ride and the lobby was filled with cigarette smoke which lingered in the halls. The hotels overall image was not as they had advertised and I couldn't wait to get to Limasol to get some rest away from the rude staff. Yes I say rude when they argue with guests. They seem to have the impression that it is the best hotel in Nicosia. Well the pipes in the showers made this howling noise before dirty water came out if you tried to use hot water. Our overall feeling was after being woken up three times during the night that we were getting what we paid for and was beyond exhaustion to argue with the staff anymore.,Asty Hotel,Review 361 Similarity,0.206835076,Review 276 Similarity,0.507833375,"{'neg': 0.157, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.9099}",-0.9099,neg
8,20,"We were in shock to find that this low priced hotel is also of low quality - - I would go so far as to say it is a dump with a foul smell in the halls. All I wanted was a quiet sleep and not to be worried about noise and safety concerns by hourly patrons making good use of the hourly rate. When I think of all the places I have stayed on Sales and Study trips - the ASTY will live forever in my mind as the one where I was fooled by head scratching reviews. At first it seemed like a run down but quiet inn - our room was a bit in disrepair but you get what you pay for. Then as night fell - noisy ""couples"" started to check in and out. Our shower didn't even work properly (kept going from cold to colder). The only thing good about the place was that there was cabs waiting to take me out of town and away from this place. Too bad they had to toot the horn all evening and keep us awake.",Asty Hotel,Review 292 Similarity,0.22140372100000003,Review 266 Similarity,0.47387910200000005,"{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': -0.6464}",-0.6464,neg
25,20,"we have been one night for business trip, and we took the recommendation of the hotel from theTripadviseor as always.Unfortunately and although Hotel Asty was recommended as number 1# in Nicosia (as the last week of July 2012), we found a very old and basic hotel. the rooms have a weird smell, room are furnished with old carpet and the mattress was very uncomfortable.the mini-bar was empty and our request to fill it up was denied because they do not fill it up ever.the gim room is equipped with old devises and the air condition did not work at all.breakfast was less than basic and the food was less than any standard we have seen.The description on the web-sight does not match the reality, for example there is no room service.I wonder why is the deference between the visitors. maybe not all the rooms are in the same condition..the good part is that the staff was very polite and you can use the hotel bicycles for fee.",Asty Hotel,Review 332 Similarity,0.332351495,Review 202 Similarity,0.410391341,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.035, 'compound': -0.3818}",-0.3818,neg
129,10,"Was greeted by the reception by a very unfriendly person. Gave me the keys and without apologising or even looking at me told me I had to change the next day from room again.Nice staff from Bulgaria/Rumania. Breakfast is overlooked by a bouncer. No a la carte menu in the evening, just food of the day. Our food was paid for by the client so they saved on ingredients (judging with what other tables got) Seems they also sell rooms per hour.Rooms are big, but old fashioned sometimes broken airco, strange smell, torn walls etc.For the same rates you should be able to get better (and more near the centre).",Asty Hotel,Review 393 Similarity,0.354245954,Review 182 Similarity,0.245255736,"{'neg': 0.123, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': -0.6163}",-0.6163,neg
