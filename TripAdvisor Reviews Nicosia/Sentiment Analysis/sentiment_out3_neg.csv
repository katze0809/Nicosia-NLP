39,10,"They destroyed my evening , the manager/ host is racist. We made reservations for 3 people outside, nobody informed us we will be seated right next to exit with wind and no heaters. Was very cold so I went to manager/host with request to move us inside as soon as someone else will leave. He was very rude and he said that we will not seat in side and nobody will not leave!!! I came back to the table, he came after me and was complaining to my greek friends in Greek about me !!!! I asked him in English and he put me down and keep talking in Greek. This is unacceptable I have sent a letter from my law agency to Cyprus tourist organization to see this case in the racist background.After 15 minutes other table left he did not move us there, then next table left so we get up and seated there.When we ask to remove some ingredients from the menu we got answer “you are not allowed “ I’m sorry if I don’t like mussels why can’t I remove it?That means they must have ready dishes, here was again attitude from the waiter.The place has high prices and I’m fine with it, but I expect service and quality, here I haven’t got anything. On top of that place was dirty, I even saw a disgusting part of the store room and made pictures. The worse part is that I have destroyed my evening and all we were very upset allNight for such stupid reasons :(Don’t go there is you don’t want to finish the same",The Gym,"{'neg': 0.149, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.9864}",-0.9864,neg
51,10,Went here tonight and have to say what an absolutely dreadful night. Customer service was horrendous. They have no idea about allergies and what to expect when someone with allergies comes into there restaurant. I told them what im allergic to and are that clueless they put the most dangerous things I couldnt eat on a plate.

87,20,"-Went to The Gym for brunch after looking at their online menu and we were informed that they don't have a brunch menu. Ended up ordering off the lunch menu, food was OK.-Service was terrible. The restaurant was almost empty and we hardly got any attention and/or service within reasonable time.Even worse, a couple stepped in, got a table and ordered coffee. 20 minutes after they made the order (they were still expecting their coffee...) another customer stepped in claiming they will be bringing about 20 people in and the waitress made the couple move to a different table, even though there were other tables to merge instead of the one they were occupying. Not only they made the couple move, they were very rude about it, and (I'm glad) the couple decided to leave (they didn't even get their coffee).As they were walking out, the same waitress said ""I didn't do anything wrong"" out loud, which was just overly rude to do, especially after her rude and unreasonable request.That being said, the atmosphere is nice if you exclude the service, but wouldn't return there for the food.",The Gym,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.019, 'compound': -0.7695}",-0.7695,neg
90,30,"Nice place, have been a few times, drinks and service good, but the food a bit lack lustre.Lunch today a nasty dry burger and a reasonable seafood linguine.The menu is a bit boring, nothing really to whet the appetite.

108,10,"We went to The Gym for lunch yesterday and the service was pretty bad. My partner ordered a Caesar salad, which doesn't usually have mustard seeds, although this one did, and she is allergic (mustard/mustard seeds were not listed as an ingredient on the menu). We asked the waiter to check if this salad indeed had mustard seeds, which was a debacle in itself as he did not seem to speak Greek or English. When we asked if they could make a new one without dressing/with a different dressing he said 'just swap meals'.

151,30,"Visited for dinner and drinks with friendsThis place was really advertised for it's fine cuisine and signature drinks.We ordered the gin and tonic of the house. Simply stunning!!But then we ordered our main course. Once we finished the appetiser, the waiter came to pick up the plates. We tried to hand in our forks and knives but the waiter said, no, just the plates, so in effect we had to eat the main course with dirty cutlery!!The main course comes in. The portions were so small, we thought we ordered from the kids menu. However the prices were for adults!!Am so disappointed, really. Taste wise it was OK, but if you want to feel that you had a proper dinner, maybe you should order double. And pay double of course!!",The Gym,"{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': -0.5405}",-0.5405,neg

Very unprofessional behaviour and the food isn't great either as they have small portions and not a great variety and above all very overpriced ...if in the neighbourhood try the market , or Mouson as this place is a major disappointment!",The Gym,"{'neg': 0.215, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.029, 'compound': -0.9636}",-0.9636,neg
187,30,"Go for the drinks, not for the food. The food is mediocre and bland, and overpriced for what you get. The salmon carpaccio came with a lot of grated carrot (!) which hid the taste of the salmon and made no sense whatsoever. The chicken with the manouri filling was tasteless and boring and at 13 euros, i expected a bit more from a dish that i could have prepared better at home. The sea food pasta was average, and the pasta was undercooked (not al dente. Undercooked).The service was not good as well. Over a dining floor with more than 25 diners, there was often no attending waiter (which meant that we had to catch their attention while they were serving drinks to the bar clientelle). Only positive, was the gentleman in charge of the wine who was helpful and knowledgable.Its a shame that such a place with such an ambiance and such a good menu (on paper) is not delivering.",The Gym,"{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.6017}",-0.6017,neg
192,10,Had to wait for 55 mins after ordering to get served. Had to buy the water in 500ml i.o. 1L (of the same brand) because they have a surcharge for the glass bottle of latter!!! Only 3 slices of potato wedges were served and when asked for some more the reply was that they ran out!!! When we complained to the manager about the delay the reply was that 40 mins lead in serving is normal....,The Gym,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.921, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7326}",-0.7326,neg
196,50,Modern place and an excellent service. Very tasty menu but in my opinion very expensive restaurant. Cyprus wines starts from 20 euro and i think its something not reasonable during the economical crisis. Only main dishes prices are reasonable. As a conclusion you need 90 euro for a dinner for 2!,The Gym,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.043, 'compound': -0.68}",-0.68,neg
207,20,Decided to go there with some friends for a drink. unfortunately the menu for the drinks (e.g. cocktails) was really small and i had a difficulty what to choose since i couldn't find anything to drink. i decided to have a cocktail which was the WORST cocktail i've had in my life. Also the stuff was really rude. however i have to admit that the atmosphere was really nice. oh and also the prices are high,The Gym,"{'neg': 0.156, 'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': -0.7125}",-0.7125,neg
