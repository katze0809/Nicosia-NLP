But the most important Factor about the renovation is the increased parking space which has been a problem since it was built. I think now with double parking spaces. However it is still not resolved the problem with the congestion. I have not researched it completely but I think there are no new entrances into the parking areas. Also, it would be good to be able to get some piece of paper from each parking spot so that you don't lose it as now they are too big.

102,30,"Visiting the Mall of Cyprus? Well, as a tour guide I sometimes need to stop at the mall as part of the tour's itinerary. The location is easily accessible upon entering Nicosia from the main highway. You just take the exit from the main road and you reach a round about. Take the third exit and then take the first exit on the next round about. You will see the Nicosia General hospital to your right. You will reach another small round about and take the first exit again. If you are traveling with a private car then park on the underground parking so you avoid the hot sun and the heat. Go through one of the main underground entrances and up the escalator. By one of the underground main entrances there is a shoe repair and key shop. There is more traffic and less parking space after 3:00pm daily and after 1:00pm on the weekends. Upon entering the mall you will find two levels: The ground floor, filled with shops, small bakery, an MTN store, a watch shop and other department stores. The top floor has some sport shops, electronics, art shops, and stands selling various goods such as nuts, tea and other items (which are just expensive).On the west part of the upper floor are the cafeterias, the cinema and the restaurants which are well known franchise brands.Now the biggest issue here is the bad acoustic. The actual structure of the mall has no sound absorption and the sounds multiplies. I know some younger ages won't mind because they want to be where the masses are, but when we visit with a tour and there is people with hearing devices then this causes discomfort. I suggest avoid the cafeteria and restaurants section, or make a quick visit and choose to seat on the large veranda outside. You will see it between the Starbucks and TGIF. The only negative thing there, it is a smokers area. So you will need to deal with that issue too. So if you want, you can choose the quiet cafeteria situated on the easter upper floor, for a quick coffee and a drink.More and more malls are being build in Cyprus. My concern is if the consumer's comfort and well being should really be taken under consideration.So my advise is: avoid the cafeteria area unless you really have to go.
