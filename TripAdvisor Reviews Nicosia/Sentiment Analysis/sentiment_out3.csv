As a concept the salad was good, the taste was actually dreadful as it was absolutely drowned in an extremely sweet beyond belief dressing. It was practically inedible it was so sweet. At one point we started to wonder if they misinterpreted the salad for a soup as you could almost scoop out the dressing. Had it not been for the dressing, it would actually have been a nice salad. You have been warned. Stay clear of the spinach and anari salad drowned in super sweet dressing.Why I gave this place an average rating when the majority of my comments were negative?

It took at least half an hour for someone to come and take our drinks order, which was slightly frustrating as there was not even water provided on the tables, our cocktails eventually arrived and were actually very good, our table was then laid as we were drinking and our order taken for food.We shared a spinach rice dish for starter which was really very delicious, my friend and I had the beef and our other friend the lamb. All were excellent cuts of meat, cooked beautifully, the only downside is what they were served with. The beef fillet was sat on an entire plate of mash with a few mushrooms under the meat, it was delicious but there was way too much mash and a few green vegetables would have made it perfect, the lamb was at the other end of the extreme, served only with a few vegetables and nothing else, we had the fruit platter for desert which was really lovely and beautifully presented.
