The security services at the parking cannot give you any assistance and you must go to the service point to take a wheel chair.

21,40,"I have to give 4 or maybe less because of the parking. Went on a Saturday afternoon, and there were cars parked on the roundabouts, on the kerbs, on the approach roads. I was shuttled into a muddy field to park, and thought I might not get out of this space later. Anyway, when we did decide to leave, i was impressed that at least they have outside lighting, so while I had to walk a kilometre to find my car, at least I could see where I was going. I don't think I will ever go on the weekend again.Onto the shops, great choice of shops. A Mall for average people, not the super rich. Plenty of each category, unlike other mall we can mention. plenty of beauty shops, and shoe shops and handbag shops. Shops I haven't seen in Cyprus like Wallis. Lots of sports shops.Onto the coffee and restaurants. Not many seats to get a coffee and sit down. We went to Costa coffee and grabbed a table someone had just left.
