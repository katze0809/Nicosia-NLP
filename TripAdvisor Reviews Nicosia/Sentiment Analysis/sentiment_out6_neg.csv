4,40,"Still my favorite mall in Nicosia. Good variety of shops and restaurants. Nicely renovated, but restrooms can sometimes be dirty and tacky looking. Bulky soap dispensers make it difficult to wash. They too need a renovation now..",The Mall of Cyprus,"{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.705, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': -0.4939}",-0.4939,neg

Absolutely disgusting. Very disappointed in this since they seem to make little effort to clean and there is absolutely nothing in place to stop birds from scavenging.

30,20,"I am from England and was visiting Nicosia for the day so decided to swing-by ""The Mall of Cyprus"" on public transport a local Bus from Nicosia Bus Station to the Mall.On arrival getting off the Bus, you walk via an underground car park then past Ikea to inside the Mall.I was soo disappointed as not that many shops. Even more disappointing was the ""Swarovski"" store upstairs - the prices being a lot more expensive than the Swarovski UK store so I left empty-handed.I visited on a Saturday which was ultra busy with locals at the Cinema and eateries. There is nothing special at this Mall and it is very gloomy inside. I did spot Debenhams and a few well-known stores, but I was not fussed abt them. I was searching for classy stores, sadly you will not find a touch of class at this Mall.I stopped by the Information deak downstairs, and staff was helpful to me giving directions to the main Coach stops back to Ayia Napa (cost only 9euro return).The Coach stop is located outside the big Hospital.",The Mall of Cyprus,"{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.057, 'compound': -0.538}",-0.538,neg

86,30,"Having visited Ikea I popped into the mall for a look around... It took ten minutes! Very small, limited shops and restaurants but suppose it's handy for any last minute items you may need. Although small, it is a well kept mall and nice to mooch about. The worst part was the car park....it may be the most disorganised car park I've ever visited. It doesn't flow easily, all the signs are in Greek, people park like complete buffoons and there are numerous dead ends which go nowhere! Sometimes you'll be in a lane and there is room for two...then there is only room for one car so someone has to reverse...miles back! It's just poorly designed and has not been thought out at all. People park in the road... Blocking the limited access you already have and it is not managed at all by the mall.",The Mall of Cyprus,"{'neg': 0.156, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.057, 'compound': -0.9567}",-0.9567,neg

102,30,"Visiting the Mall of Cyprus? Well, as a tour guide I sometimes need to stop at the mall as part of the tour's itinerary. The location is easily accessible upon entering Nicosia from the main highway. You just take the exit from the main road and you reach a round about. Take the third exit and then take the first exit on the next round about. You will see the Nicosia General hospital to your right. You will reach another small round about and take the first exit again. If you are traveling with a private car then park on the underground parking so you avoid the hot sun and the heat. Go through one of the main underground entrances and up the escalator. By one of the underground main entrances there is a shoe repair and key shop. There is more traffic and less parking space after 3:00pm daily and after 1:00pm on the weekends. Upon entering the mall you will find two levels: The ground floor, filled with shops, small bakery, an MTN store, a watch shop and other department stores. The top floor has some sport shops, electronics, art shops, and stands selling various goods such as nuts, tea and other items (which are just expensive).On the west part of the upper floor are the cafeterias, the cinema and the restaurants which are well known franchise brands.Now the biggest issue here is the bad acoustic. The actual structure of the mall has no sound absorption and the sounds multiplies. I know some younger ages won't mind because they want to be where the masses are, but when we visit with a tour and there is people with hearing devices then this causes discomfort. I suggest avoid the cafeteria and restaurants section, or make a quick visit and choose to seat on the large veranda outside. You will see it between the Starbucks and TGIF. The only negative thing there, it is a smokers area. So you will need to deal with that issue too. So if you want, you can choose the quiet cafeteria situated on the easter upper floor, for a quick coffee and a drink.More and more malls are being build in Cyprus. My concern is if the consumer's comfort and well being should really be taken under consideration.So my advise is: avoid the cafeteria area unless you really have to go. Seat on the outside area for a meal or a drink.Happy shopping!",The Mall of Cyprus,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': -0.7155}",-0.7155,neg
105,30,"If you happen to be in Nicosia and the weather is too bad to enjoy the outdoors, head to the Mall of Cyprus to kill some time. It's not a huge mall, but there are some decent shops (including Zara, Debenham's, Next, Swarovski etc), plus there are some fast food places (McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut), a supermarket, cafeterias and a cinema. IKEA is located right next to the Mall.",The Mall of Cyprus,"{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': -0.5394}",-0.5394,neg
