12,10,"We tried t reach the hotel, but as it is in the invaded part from Cyprus, taxis from the cypriot side cannot cross the borders and you have to take a taxi from the turkish parts Very hard to find the hotel because there are no indications, thouth they claim it is very close to the border.. They will ask a fortune for that. We had to contact the hotel by pohone but each time youion may turn have to pay an international call, so a cheap hotel night will cost you very expensive. Also they earn money not allowing to cancel the reservation, since lots of people may desist like us. Foreign people do not have the real idea of Nicosia situation before they know the city. So my husband came to the hotel with bags over my wheelchair (I waited in the cypriot part) , the lady does not speak english, he explained our difficults to get there with luggage and wheelchair,but she did not care, did not offer help to bring us to the Turkish side and we prefer to cancel. It was cheaper and more dconfortable to loose this reservation and rent on the other side.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel,"{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.8222}",-0.8222,neg
84,50,"In 1878 the administration of the island was officially transferred to the British Empire. Nicosia became the colony's capital. During the British occupation Nicosia developed not only within the walls but also outside the historical centre. When the British took over Cyprus they entered Nicosia from the Kyrenia Gate. During the Ottoman period there were gate wardens. Horoz Ali (Ali, The Rooster) was the warden of the Kyrenia Gate and lived in the room on the second floor. Horoz Ali, was allowed by the new administration to carry on his duty of closing the doors at sunset and opening them after the morning Azan was recited. He continued his job until he died in 1946 at the age of 121. From then on the worn out doors of the Kyrenia Gate remained open at all times. In 1931 the walls on either side of the Kyrenia Gate were knocked down to create a road after one of Nicosia's first buses turned out to be too high to go through the original gate.",Kyrenia Gate,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.031, 'compound': -0.4767}",-0.4767,neg
