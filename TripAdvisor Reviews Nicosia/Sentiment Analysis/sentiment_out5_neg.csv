71,10,"Based on the others good reviews, we went and regretted so much. We went as a family of 4, 2 small girls who barely eat much adult food. We wanted to order 2 portions, but the owner insisted to have 3 portions. The portion is small for a typical Cypriot tavern, because we eat out a lot and we always order 2 portions till now and usually can't finish the food. The so-called 3 portions are actually smaller than the 2 portions that we got elsewhere. For a family of 4 including two young children, paying 60 Euros for a casual dinner including 1 water and 1 beer is a bit too much for the crisis Cyprus now. Also location is a bit of in the middle of no where, parking is for 1-2 car. The worst part for me is the salty food - even one of us is Cypriot who is used to salty food, agreed the food was too salty. We will think twice now by choosing a restaurant based on the good reviews by others!!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': -0.8331}",-0.8331,neg
