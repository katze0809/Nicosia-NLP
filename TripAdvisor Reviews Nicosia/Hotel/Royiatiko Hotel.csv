10,"We stayed in Royatiko hotel for a weekend. It was our worst experience by far. We called them the day of check in, asking for the price per night via telephone and they charged more upon arrival, just 4 hours later.The manager was very rude when we asked the reason for the overcharging. The room had old furniture. The sheets had holes on them. The kettle was dirty. The fridge had a sandwich from the previous resident expired a week before. The balcony was very dirty with pigeons' poop. The corridors were also dirty with spiderwebs and hair hanging from the curtains.I would recommend find another place to stay when visiting Nicosia.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"I stayed at this hotel (always for business) a few years ago ... not much time after it had opened. I was rather surprised because I found that the hotel has undergone no renovation at all. That’s a pity ... in fact the location is perfect (very close to Ledra street -the core of Nicosia) and some improvements will definitely change a lot the rating. Rooms are ok, nothing special but what you basically need when you travel for business. Clean, I appreciate the pleasantly perfumed towels but terrible mattress ... soft with the springs entering your bones ... I tried to change room but -as a matter of fact- all rooms have that type or mattresses ! My suggestion is to change them straight away ...There is a nice pool close to the lobby where you find a bar with a sort of terrace where you can have breakfast too. Unfortunately it is infested by pigeons all day long: they come from everywhere to drink the water and it’s dirty all around (... in 10 days I have never seen anybody bathing in the pool !). Breakfast is reasonable and the staff very friendly.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Royiatiko Hotel is in a nicely located just a block off of Ledra Street. Immediate area is quiet, but not very scenic. The bed was comfortable and the room had good aircon and wi-fi. Breafast was very good with scrambled eggs and meats every day and yogurt and honey available. Hotel staff were very helpful with any questions that we had. Pool looked very nice, but we never found the time to use it.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Easy to find. Clean areas, comfortable bedroom. Change of towels and cleaning of the room daily. The breakfast area by the pool is very welcome. The breakfast buffet has a variety of fresh items.Only problem is the parking.",Royiatiko Hotel
10,"We booked for two nights during our trip to Cyprus. During our stay, the service staff was quite friendly, sharing with us the history of Cyprus. However, upon entering the rooms, the experience was totally different. The furniture in the rooms were dated. When we pulled open the sheets, we noticed the blankets were all stained and they look like they haven’t been washed for months. The shower was also stuck. It made the whole experience very unpleasant.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,Excellent location 25 metres from ilforno on ledra streetGreat priceAmazing staff very accommodatingSuper breakfastSafety deposit box which was not listed as a facility on booking .comLoved the poolCould do with full length mirror in bedroom but really cannot be faulted in relation to value for money,Royiatiko Hotel
50,"I've really enjoyed my stay here the hotel is about 20 metres from Ledras Street and as a result is in an absolutely fabulous location. There's a small pool and gym, and the rooms have small balcony's, WiFi, Aircon, a kettle, a small fridge, a small safe and the sundry items you'd expect (coffee, shampoo, soap etc) the staff are friendly. The buffet breakfast is good. Some of the fittings and fixtures are a bit tired but are serviceable, e.g. the shower head would slowly drift down the pole and there was the odd scuff and scratch here and there but regardless, great value.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"My partner and I just returned from a three night stay at the Royiatiko in Nicosia. The hotel's biggest advantage is its location. It is so centrally located. We walked to all the sights in the city center and it is also 5 minute walking distance from the checkpoint to visit the Turkish side of the island. Restaurants and shopping were literally at your doorstep. Overall, I found the hotel to be a notch just above a dorm. The room's bed was not much more than a box spring and the bed's covers looked outdated. The airconditioning unit did work perfectly and there was internet connection. I didn't like the hotel at first but it grew on me right away. It was fine. The morning breakfast was good too. It was nothing to rave about but It filled us up for the day. Overall, I would stay here again. It was a restful and peaceful stay. I would like to thank Anna, the Filipina at the front desk for being so welcoming and allaying my fears about the stressful KAPNOS shuttle ride we took from the airport.",Royiatiko Hotel
10,"So....I called directly to the hotel to reserve a room. I ve been told by the reception that the cost is 55 euros per night.. we stayed 2 nights. When we checked out they asked the amount of 160 euros from us. I asked why and they said that is because they are fully booked.And then I said that I have booked one and a half month ago and the price we been given is 55 euros per night and NOT 80...Second thing is that the rooms are very dirty, looks like they are used from bordels and escorts around the area.Smelly sheets, very dirty floor and bathroom. Outdated decoration, the bed mattress was super hard and difficult to sleep. Seems that is Never replaced. The television was in a place that there was no place to sit to watch. Brown heavy curtains that close the room even more. A plastic spoon for your coffee and in general everything in the room VERY cheap.From our experience this hotel should charge around 30euros instead of 80 euros per night.. Pure rip off. We couldnt do anything because I didnt know the name of the desk person that gave me this false information about the prices. But it seems that they confront their clients for the prices with the excuse that they are overbooked. Tripadvisor price was 70 per night and the lady said to us 80euros!Not accepted. Because I have booked 1 and a half month ago to get a good booking, price included.The Only good thing is the location and free parking but everything else suck big time.Please be carefull when booking with this hotel and ask for confirmation of price before you stay written if possible..Tip: there are a lot of Apartments, Airbnb and hotels in that area that offer much better prices than this place.Extra info, the poolside was too small, no place to lay your bed basically,and one pool 3x2 ... visitors card costs 12 euros.......!Bad vibes from our experience.Overall it gets a 3/10 from me.I dont see myself booking over there again.For that price DEFINITELY not.Good luck",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"We stayed here for two nights. The location - less than 100 meters from Ledra - is fantastic as is the friendly and personable service. Expedia had made a mistake with our confirmed reservation, and the hotel - which was completely booked - found a way for us to stay. Decent breakfast and pool are pluses.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"We wanted to write a review for quite some time but did not manage to earlier. Last year we booked several rooms at the hotel for family and friends that came to Nicosia for our wedding. Stavrina is probably one of the most professional people we had the pleasure to cooperate so far who so patiently and politely helped us with the process. All our guests were happy from the rooms, service, cleaness, food and location since it's a few minutes walk to the old city centre full of restaurants, cafe and bars. We definitely recommend it. Thank you Stavrina for everything. M&K",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"We booked a small room for one night and the Mrs spoke to Stavrina she was very helpful telling us how to find the place and parking outside. (See my photos)Room clean, two large single beds and lovely shower.Air-conditioning, free WiFi, coffee + kettle.The staff sorted us with a iron and hair dryer.Breakfast the fried breakfast well sausages where small frankfurters, streaky bacon, baked beans, oily mushrooms, scrambled eggs?, we didn't like but who say you wouldn't or might be better the next dayBut the cold meats, salad, fresh fruit, yoghurt. Croissants, fresh rolls, sliced bread,Made up for the cooked.Lovely swimming pool walking distance to the centre and bus service which you can go to the airport's, staff are very friendly and helpful hope management pass our thanks to them all.wish we had few days stay there.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"We knew that we had booked a 2 star and were amazed at the price for 2 nights in the city. It is a very clean hotel. Our bathroom was clean though the showerhead really needs replaced (sorry I meant to tell you this when we left). Bedroom was fine though looked a wee bit tired in places. Breakfast adequate and plentiful with good choice. Free parking too. We really only needed a place to sleep as we didn't go to look at 4 walls! Great location about 50 metres from Ledra Street.The duvet cover was non existent which was weird.One of our highlights was Lia, who worked there. She was great fun and very professional.Would definitely recommend for one or two nights.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"I had the chance to stay in this hotel for few nights and I have to say that it is perfectly located in the very heart of Nicosia, few metres away from Ledra Street. Rooms are new and clean.The hotel has a pool and the breakfast was rich and tasty.Only advice is to have a minibar at least with a bottle of water in it.I would definetly recommend this hotel to other people!",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"This hotel is literally seconds from Ledras Street, making it an excellent location for tourists. There is also a car park within a 30 second walk which is great.The hotel is very reasonably priced. My wife was able to borrow a hair dryer from reception. There is a bar and a lift to the upper floors. Breakfast was ok, better than I expected with cooked options, however the sausages were horrible.My only real complaint, and my reason for a 3 star review was the bed. It was uncomfortable and it wasn’t until Sunday morning that we realised that the duvet had no duvet cover on it! Understandably we both found this to be disgusting and unhygienic.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"The room was very clean and the location of the hotel was perfect, next to the market and the centre. The staff there were really helpful!I wished we had more cosmetics in the bathroom. The breakfast was ok, without big variety, but with all the necessary.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Breakfast was limited but excellent quality. Personnel extremely friendly. Location: couldn't be better, although a little noisy due to a parking lot just outside. Walking distance is too little to say: around the corner is the correct expression. On the other hand the mattress was too soft for me. Sorry! And I had a slight trouble with the curtains.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Very good location for visiting the old town, just a few steps away from bustling Ledra Street. The room was fine and had a small balcony. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was very good for a hotel of this size and price - including great yoghurt, croissants, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon. A special thanks to the lady who served coffee at breakfast, who was very efficient and friendly.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"A very good location, right in the centre of the old part of Nicosia. As to be expected the hotel is surrounded by old buildings, some in better condition than others. We arrived on the Inter City bus from Paphos and the bus terminius is only five minutes away from the hotel. From the hotel it is very easy to visit the sights. The foot crossing over the border to Turkish Northern Cyprus is no more than 10 minutes away. It's well going over the border - most things are cheaper including beer which is typically around €1.50 a pint in a restaurant. No complaint about the hotel. It was fine. Breakfast was good and staff also pleasant and helpful.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"+: the location is good as close to the Ledra Street so within the city center, there's a parking, not easy to find with a car same as the hotel but feasible, it's quiet, the pool is very nice but closes quite early, the staff is nice.-: the hotel location is convenient okay but the neighborhood is not very nice and kind of weird, the view is on a car park which is not very nice, the furnitures and the decoration is very old and simple, would need a refresh, the pool closes very early, the bar is not working which is sad as it would be so nice next to the pool but the hotel was very far from being full... The breakfast is very simple and not so qualitative would love to have nice local fresh products knowing that Cyprus has ton of production in vegetables and fruits!",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"This hotel has a very handy location close to many sights and shopping. Pool is small but ok for a quick swim. Breakfast is simple but fairly good quality (coffee and croissants actually very good). As others have commented, the beds are a bit on the hard side but otherwise all essentials are there, including air conditioning. Staff vary from very warm to somewhat less enthusiastic but all responded to enquiries and get the job done. Would recommend.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"During our holiday in Cypros, we spent 3 days in Nicosia and thank god we ended up in Royiatiko!!! Lovely and helpfull staff, good rooms, gym and even breakfast( with even I mean everything from our stay surprised us in a positiv direction). We travel with a one year old so to live in the heart of Ledra Street/Nicosia is just amaizing and for us 10 out of 10! I can’t get my mind around only 2 stars, and hopefully if we ever return u will be ***!",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Situated in the city centre of Nicosia, the Royiatiko is good value for money. Whatever is offered by the hotel absolutely fulfills what you can and would expect from a two-star-hotel. Breakfast buffet is nothing special, but is absolutely sufficient for a start into the day. The hotel has even got a pool to cool down after a hot day. What else could you want from a reasonably priced hotel right in the centre of a European capital.We had booked two double rooms and had let the hotel know, that we would be arriving at two in the morning, which they confirmed by email. However, we were received by the most impolite receptionist I’ve ever met in my life. He pretended to not have known about keeping both rooms for us until after midnight and so just had one room left, the second would no longer be available for us. What followed was a very unfriendly discussion. Only when I kept insisting on having both rooms immediately as otherwise I would not hesitate sleeping on one of the sofas in the hotel lobby, that man eventually gave us the cards for both our rooms.I did inform the hotel manager about the incident and she promised to follow the case.Apart from this particular receptionist the staff was fantastic, helpful and friendly at all times.Despite our extremely bad experience with one of the receptionists the Royiatiko will remain one of my choices when returning to Nicosia next time.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Royatiko hotel is a medium class hotel with excellent service ,central position in the old town and no nonsense facilities. The rooms are small and so is the bathroom but are adequately equipped EXCEPT for the balconies which need a chair and a small table. The rooms are adequately clean but the decorations in dark colours are not pleasant. The breakfast has enough of everything but lacks the local touch.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Location matters. Royatiko is at the heart of Nicosia literally a few yards from Ledra street and all the restaurants and amenities. The hotel itself would do with some maintenance, but it’s clean and the rooms are air conditioned, which is a must in Nicosia. The breakfast is fine and there is a swimming pool. The staff is very friendly.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Nice hotel with a swimming pool, which is appreciated ahem it is so hot (33 C today), really in the center of the old town near Ledras street where there are lots of restaurants.The staff is very nice.Ome thing is not nice: the bed mattress. I really understand why the owner does not invest in mattress (the bed spring is good) because when the note of Trip Advisor and Booking will be below 8, nobody will select this hotel anymore and the owner will not get the money to invest anymore...Bad strategy in my view.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Right bang in the middle of the tourist area with parking, this proved an excellent choice. Very helpful friendly staff. Smallish but adequate and well presented room. Small pool with a bar, excellent breakfast, and car parking about 100 yards away. Good WiFi in rooms. Only grouse - shower cubicle a little tight for a fatty!",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"The best thing about this hotel is the location. Being in the old town is perfect as you can walk everywhere without using the car. There is also a free car park 1min from the hotel.The rest... tiny, dated, dark room, the cleanliness wasn't impeccable, the breakfast was average, the staff wasn't the warmest staff we ever met...The pool must be really nice in the summer when it is really hot and the gym isn't bad at all for a small hotel.Don't stay more than 1 or 2 nights!",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"The location could not be better being set back from Ledra street by a minute or two and perhaps 10 minutes from the crossing point into Turkey. In short everything you need is on your doorstep. The rooms are basic but this is a two star hotel and in my view could be described as three star. You get a fridge, TV, toiletries and FREE parking. The breakfast was more than adequate. A gem indeed!",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"You can wake up in the morning, step outside for fresh air and start taking in the history on the Cypriot side and, if you wish, within 15 minutes, on the Turkish side. The balcony in the room and the large doors lets the crisp sunshine into the room, which, while not really big, is cozy, comfy and clean with a laaaarge bathroom.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Stayed here recently for a couple of nights as my husband was speaking at a conference. Our room did look out on a car park which didn't bother me, but basically - the location cannot be beat. And I experienced a major helping hand from the owner herself (see end below )You are 2 mins walk from Ledras street, full of eateries, shops, kebab pit stops, and new hipster places like The Gym & Market resto/bars. The wooden shutters did a great job keeping the light out, and the bed was comfy too, leading to a restful night.Staff were very friendly, breakfast had nice range of hot and cold dishes (scrambled eggs & bacon were yummy), and reception was toasty both nights when Nicosia was feeling chilly. Lady running breakfast was uber efficient, and service oriented.2 things stand out for me. I asked if it was possible to get a breakfast pack our 2nd morning as our flight was early - got 2 great triple layer club sandwiches, apples, oranges, and even hardboiled eggs as requested! Really kept us going for 5 hr flight home.Secondly, owner Yiota arrived in reception just as I was explaining to the receptionist that I needed to see a doctor. And because I needed a tetanus shot, she simply bundled me into her car, and smoothed the whole process for me. Cannot thank her enough for going above and beyond to help me (a guest) like this. This typifies Cypriot friendliness, and warmth in my opinion, and we had a great bonding time in the waiting area!",Royiatiko Hotel
30,Stayed one night. Room was adequate for one night stay. Strange duvet with no cover. Bed comfortable and breakfast ok. Staff on reception more interested in looking at computer. Girl cleaning rooms very pleasant.,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"This charming hotel is in the ideal location in old Nicosia. The staff are truly wonderful. I clearly had the bad fortune to arrive on the wrong day -- a Sunday after a big fat Greek wedding the day before. It's rare the hotel where you pull back the bedsheets and find long strands of female hair on the bed, and then ask politely to change the room --- only to find the exact same story in another room. But three times is the charm: the third room was spotless, perfectly clean, nice bed, wonderful balcony, and got a good night's sleep. All in all do bear in mind you're literally at the junction of a divided city here, so being prepared to expect some unusual and weird things is par for the course. Was glad I stayed here and not in another nearby hotel. I had inspected two other hotels prior to this (one in the same price range), and they were gross.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"This is our first trip to Nicosia. This hotel appeared to be in an odd location at first but turned out to be absolutely ideal. The room was spacious with a balcony, the front desk staff extremely helpful and the lady who looked after breakfast and the pool area was fabulous. The pool was wonderful and refreshing after a day of exploring.Getting to the hotel from the Larnaca airport was a bit of an adventure but interesting nonetheless. We took the airport shuttle to Kapnos. Cost 8 Euro pp. Then we walked across the pedestrian bridge and took bus 158 to the city centre bus station for 1.5 Euro pp. The hotel was a very short walk from there. The Cypriots were very helpful with directions.If traveling to Nicosia in the future I would definitely stay at this property again!",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Lovely place to stay for a night or two to explore the Old Town museums and galleries. Friendly, room comfortable, safe, WiFi, small pool, breakfast fine, but best of all location just off Ledra St is perfect. Would recommend.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Location:Perfect! It is very close to Ledra street which is convenient for shopping and strolling to do sightseeing. Parking is available off site at no cost.Rooms:The rooms are standard size with en suite bathroom. I liked the shutters in front of the windows that can be opened especially in morning to let sunlight in. Mini fridge to keep your own items cold.Breakfast:Was included and had a small selection of hot food, fruit, cereal, different breads, yogurt and juice. It was enough and choice of different coffee and teas.What i did not like:On the beds there were no duvet covers over the duvets and they were not clean. There were some stains on it and the trimming of the small throw pillows were falling apart and leaving small pieces of black material all over.There were no sugar or tea added to the complimentary tray. A bottle of drinking water would be welcome.I would stay here again.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"This was the 3rd time I've stayed at the Royiatiko Hotel in the past year.The rooms are basic but clean and the staff are friendly. The pool is small but fine for a dip and the gym is nice and quiet.The air con was a huge relief in the 49 degree heat!Wifi in the rooms is consistent and the speed fine, and this is the same in the pool and lounge areas.The main plus point about this hotel is the (very) central location - it's just off Ledra Street so restaurants, shops etc are all close by.I've booked again for November and I'm looking forward to it.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Very good hotel. Rooms clean and tidy and excellent value. Staff are polite and friendly. There is a decent swimming pool with a bar. The hotel is very well situated right in the heart of the centre - all of the main attractions are within a 15 minute or so walk. Likewise it is adjacent to the main shopping area and many bars and restaurants. As others have commented the main downside is the parking - not least, finding it! That said the parking is free and our car didn;t come to any harm.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Located within the old town walls, the Royiatiko makes a good location for exploring the old city ... and it is close to the main bus terminal if (like me) you are traveling by public transit. Rooms are modern, good AC, but poor wifi service (in fact, I couldn't get the hotel wifi to work at all). I didn't use the pool, but it was nice and clean. Staff was efficient rather than warm/welcoming.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"As a family of 6, we stayed here overnight last Saturday (6th May) in 3 rooms. Service was faultless, rooms very well furnished and very clean, bathrooms modern and roomy. One small criticism is that the shower tiles/grout are in need of a 'deep clean' but other than that a very pleasant experience. There is a fridge in the room to store water etc. Breakfast was buffet style and was satisfactory with a selection of cooked eggs, bacon, beans, toast or fresh ham, cheeses, olives, or cereal and pastries with tea/coffee and/or fruit juices. This hotel really is right in the heart of Nicosia, a very short walk down the street and you find yourself in the heart of Ledra Street with it's fantastic array of shops, cafes, bars, restaurants etc. Parking is just around the corner in a designated car park, the attendants guide you or even park for you. I would happily stay here again and would recommend this place to others, the hotel staff were all very professional and helpful.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,Good location and very central. Nice bar with a nice atmosphere. A good meeting place before going out. Parking is not all that good but you can find other roads to park. Walking distance to restaurants and other bars.,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Delighted by location as everything was within walking distance also parking available nearby . We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel facilities and rooms . Absolutely fine for a city break .Clean,decent bed ,rooms had nice balcony ,bathrooms small but adequate . Also had a decent size pool ,great to cool off in the summer city heat . Generally good value for the money we paid ,pleasant enough and would definitely use again when in Nicosia.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Again, very surprising to see a modern, clean, and welcoming hotel with elevator right in the old part of Southern Nicosia. Very convenient to Lidras Street crossing over to TRNC Turkish part. Breakfast is included and offers good variety, elevator is convenient if you have luggage.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"One way roads made it difficult to find the hotel, but it was well worth the effort. Perfect location for exploring both south and north Nicosia. No need to use the car. Numerous places to eat within a few minutes walk. Rooms were small but newly decorated, and clean and contained fridge, safe, coffee and tea facilities and excellent wifi.Positives -Excellent location.Free parking.Friendly reception staff.Newly decorated rooms.Excellent free wifi.Negatives -Unfriendly breakfast staffBasic breakfastSmall rooms",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Although the hotel enjoys a great location and offers a free parking lot, it's biggest problem is the 24/7 NOISE coming from people who come in or go out all night long. I don't know what goes on during the day because we left it every day around 10AM but at night...it is a nightmare! oh, and the coffee in the moning is abominable: / If you need a place to spend a night or one day it will do...longer - a problem",Royiatiko Hotel
20,"Difficult to find a good hotel in Nicosia and royiatiko is below average unless you are charged at 50-60€ maximum. Old furnitured rooms , lack of amenities, hard bed and pillows , basic breakfast, good location in Ledra str. Wifi was ok.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Undoubtedly great location, very convenient, friendly and helpful staff as well, but that's that for the pro's. The rooms are old-fashioned and small and the blankets were lacking. I know it's hot in Cyprus but people have different preferences, please! By the way, for people who use it, there was no mini bar...",Royiatiko Hotel
20,"not much the room was spacious just that. They place looked great from the photos, but on the inside looked dated. Not very clean and the twin bed mattress had a whole on one side we slept both on the one side of the bed because of that. Breakfast was very very basic.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,High season all year. Low season in July and August when business people are on holiday! Cool reception staff. Interesting night receptionist from Egypt who speaks 6 languages. Lebanese/Cypriot owned hotel. All staff bar one from other English speaking countries. Top marks to the charming helpful Roumania breakfast manager Lia who went out of her way to be kind. Cannot say the same for the sulky Moldavian breakfast woman with a AN unfriendly attitude when Lia had her day off! Self service small buffet. Excellent croissants. Good selection of teas. Spotless. Free wifi. It is cheaper to book on the net then pay direct! Useful note block and attractive silver ballpoint given. Bleak bare bedroom walls. No pictures. Ask for a room with a balcony 204 or 208. Smoking area by the pool.,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"The place is conveniently located, and the staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. But wifi did not work properly in some rooms, and most of the television stations were not working either.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,Top location in the center of the old town.Free parking 30 meters away.The rooms are clean and modern.Staff polite and helpful.Highly recommend for all type of travelers.We will stay here in our next visit to Cyprus.,Royiatiko Hotel
40,"The hotel is located in the heart of the city of Nicosia, close to the busy area with shops, nightlife or even the Turkish borders. The hotel is clean, and the rooms of a good size and quiet. One disadvantage is that the hotel does not have its own parking, so you will have to park to a place just across the street, where the staff is rude and might mistreat your vehicle. The wifi is not functional all the time and quite slow in the evening hours. Other than that, I would say that it is quite good value for its money.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,Nice hotel with an excellent location. Clean and decent rooms. Very friendly staff. The breakfast is the same everyday though. The telivision has english channels. The pool is great but mostly shaded because of the tall buildings next to the hotel.,Royiatiko Hotel
40,"50 yards from Ledra Street made this an ideal location for our exploration of the old walled Nicosia. In addition, the hotel has a small car park, a couple of minutes walk away, which is a real bonus when staying in an hotel within the walled city itself. As would be expected, the roads were very narrow but vehicle traffic was light, so we had plenty of time to correct our numerous naviation errors! The hotel had all the facilities we needed to relax at the end of our busy sightseeing.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Great location, very clean, professional service and free parking. Furniture new, bathroom very clean and new. Smoking is not allowed but you can smoke at the lobby. Beds very cmfortable. Breakfast was very good! In total i recommend this hotel if you decide to come to nicosia! We had a great time!!",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"The location is hard to beat but otherwise the hotel is underwhelming. Rooms are small and feel like a hostel, not even one picture on the wall and very tired brown decor. Room choice was poor, breakfast average, service not very onto it and the main inhabitants enjoying the pool were local pigeons.Stay here if the old town location is a must.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,It's the only hotel I stayed in in Nicosia.Room 205!Wrap around balcony; huge bathroom with a great shower. Wifi too.Two streets away from Ledras Street.Car parking available 50m from the hotel.The room's floor pan is a quarter circle - a large circle though with air conditioning.The staff and cleaners are cheerful and obliging. Don't expect to be waited on hand and foot but ask for anything eg. Tea bags soap or directions and they are so obliging.Pool was great to swim in measuring 45 X 18 feet. If you swim they provide additional towels.Breakfast fundamentally is continental although boiled and scrambled eggs and bacon available.View is not brilliant but as a location it cannot be beaten.I shall use this hotel everytime I come to Nicosia.It is clean no cockroaches found.The girls are honest and make your room up everyday. They are very friendly too.No it's not 5* but it is warm friendly clean and welcoming.,Royiatiko Hotel
50,Its location is just in the centre.The bedrooms & beds are very comfortable.The shower is perfect alsoThe parking included is an important thing in that point of the city.Swimming pool included is a sooo relaxing detail.,Royiatiko Hotel
50,Very good servise. Very clean swimming pool and the restaurant and the rooms. Its near to city town and ledras street. You can enjoy your vacation. Good breakfast. Its a good experience. Everything u need staff can help you.,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"The best thing about this hotel is its location in the old town. Apart from that, everything else is pretty basic. The reception and staff are not especially friendly, breakfast is basic, and the room is satisfactory albeit dirty. A couple of cockroaches walked out from under my bed, so I looked and the space under the bed had not been cleaned in years. So, manage your expectations.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"We stayed here for only one night as we were visiting family nearby, the room was small but it was well equipped for the two of us,i had no complaints, the staff were good fun,and really friendly. Plenty to do and see in Nicosia, but we have been here before so we new where to go and what to do. Very historic city and very interesting, just a word of warning though, take your passport if you wish to go over to the Turkish side,otherwise you won't be able too.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Excellent location, right in the centre of Nicosia: couldn't choose better! Staff is nice, cozy swimming pool and the room was new and clean, with a very large bathroom. Parking right behind the hotel, and right in front there is a family that does laundry service! Excellent value for money!!Could have more choice for breakfast but really all in all we had a lovely experience!",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Perfect location in the center, everything is walking distance, the room was very clean and helpful staff and the aircondionting worked perfectly. The swimming pool is not very big but very pleasant and right next the eating areaA good price for a good room",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Very nice hotel next to Ledra street. 5 minute walk from border crossing. Very near to Nicosia's bars & restaurants. Rooms nice & cool and clean with a fridge. Breakfast was nice with hooch of reads, fruits, cereals & cooked option. Pool was nice and refreshing after a day shopping in the sun.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in July. perfect hotel, 2 min walk for the main street for food and drinks. shower is slightly small but clean, they don't replace your shampoo ect during your stay but don't moan buy your own! Maid came in every day to clean our room and empty the bins.Breakfast is basic but you can eat as much as you fancy, eggs, beans bacon, fresh fruit, tinned fruit, croissants, buns, bread, tea coffee, juice.We did see some call girls getting picked up down the side street near the hotel but its not the hotels faultI would stay again and recommend to everyone",Royiatiko Hotel
40,Great location . Reception staff friendly professional and helpful . Small swimming pool which was great to cool off after a very hot Nicosia day . The rooms are average size but very clean and nicely decorated . The breakfast is continental . I would recommend this hotel for business or short stays due to its location although on the negative tariffs are a little on the high side,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"This hotel has so much going for it and is very comfortable! If it were not for the Friday and Saturday night bar crowds causing so much noise, this would get another star.The location to the old walled city is excellent and there is so much to do within walking distance. I loved this aspect.Good breakfast, great staff and a nice little gym.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,The hotel lives up to the warm hospitality of Cyprus.Nestled in the old city of Nicosia it's the place to spend your night as its just 50 metres from the bustling street life of Nicosia.From here you walk less than 100 metres and you are in the Border with the Turkish occupied side of Cyprus. .propably the most friendly border crossing on earth.Their Internet connection is super so is their bfast.The rooms are medium n neat ..however for the week I was here twice they forgot to issue soap.No gym here so wake up n run to Turkey n back.For 90 EURO Bed and breakfast it's worthy the cost.,Royiatiko Hotel
40,This is the second time I've stayed at the Royiatiko. It's central location is unbeatable. Excellent for sight-seeing. My only criticism is that the pool feels cramped and extremely overlooked.Next time I visit Nicosia I shall again choose this hotel.,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"The room was clean , not too big but comfortable.. It was really close to old town in a quiet neighborhood! Breakfast was average, it could have more choices and more fresh...Actually i think the price of accommodation was overpriced but everything is about the location",Royiatiko Hotel
40,This is a well appointed hotel with good rooms and facilities. Well positioned with friendly staff. Our only complaint was that after an evening in town we decided to go back to the hotel for a drink and were shocked to be presented with a bill for 15 euros for a coffee and a glass of red wine. As you can see on the receipt the wine cost 12 euros a glass. It was quite pleasant wine but had we stayed for a few drinks then the bill would have been an unpleasant shock. We did wonder if the young woman on duty would have been prepared to pay such prices!We would return to the hotel but would definitely avoid the bar.,Royiatiko Hotel
20,"It is in a good location, but that's about it. The rooms are mediocre, the design isold, dark, not very good taste or quality. What amuses me a lot is that they have 15 hairdryers, that are normally taken, so good luck early in the morning if you quickly need one. Apparently some guests have stolen them, so now they decided not to put them in the rooms anymore and punish everybody else. The iron is even funnier - the receptionist tells you that he cannot help you, you need to go floor by floor, look on the corridor and see if you can find any irons on the floor. Have you ever heard of anything similar before? If there is none, than blame the other guests and go to work in wrinkled clothes. Really weird concept of customer service.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Hotel staff were very friendly. Breakfast was okay - could have had some fresh fruit salad instead of canned. Scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, yoghurt, honey, croissants, decent coffee or cappuccino. Just basic. Parking was nearby but easy to get to - no more than 50 metres from hotel in a safe lot - no problem at all. Pull up in car at front of hotel, unload bags and they will tell you where the parking lot is. Do not park in lot right in front of hotel as it is not their lot and way too much money. Price was affordable for hotel. WIFI was weak though - the only issue we had with the place. Bed was comfortable enough - but not great. Shower was a small portal shower which for me being tall is a bit tight, but still fine. Good hot water. THE LOCATION IS EXCELLENT!!! We did not use the pool as we were there in March, but it looked good enough to do laps and looked clean.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Helpful and friendly staff , great location for Ledra street and boarder crossing by foot to the Turkish side of Nicosia.Many Restaurants within walking distance ,especially seafood Ocean Basket which was amazing .",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"This hotel is perfect for a city centre break in Nicosia. It is only a mere 50 metres from the southern end of Ledra Street. There is good parking within 150 metres that has an attendant during the daylight hours. The room was the usual hotel type layout and very clean. It contained a TV, a fridge and free safety deposit box. Breakfast was good. The cooked items included scrambled eggs and bacon. There was also a good choice of continental items as well as cereals and staff were attentive and helpful.Our only complaints were the lighting in the corridor was not working and it took three days before it was finally rectified. The tea and coffee facilities were not replenished adequately (in fact there were no tea bags until we requested some) and on our final night we discovered that the toiletries were not replenished.However that said, we would recommend this hotel to anyone keen to stay right in the heart of the city. Given the very central location it is also very quiet during the night and we slept well.We will definitely use this hotel again.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Just arrived back to Paphos having spent four nights in this hotel. Great location just 2 mins walk from Ledra Street and five mins walk from the border crossing. Great value for money. Lovely staff, good breakfast. Would definitely stay there again.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Modern and central in the old part of town only 1 minute from the main street and 10 minutes walk to the nearest checkpoint. Rooms are fine but pool area are tiny with sun only at a limited period, and there are a lot of pigeons making life miserable.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Nicosia, being far from the sea is not a tourist destination. It is however an interesting city with much history and worth a visit. Because of its isolation the city lacks any of the major hotel chains. Royiatiko, is walking distance away from the city's main street, Ledra. The hotel is clean and unpretentious. It has a small pool, and an adequate breakfast is served. What it lacks in luxury, is compensated by its friendly staff especially its owner, Yiota, who goes out of her way to assist her guests.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"The hotel is centrally placed. It had a pool which is very nice however it was not cleaned properly. I was sitting almost 2 hours by the pool and the waitress was not willing to come and ask what I would like to drink.Breakfast was basic, nothing fancy.the room was very hot and the air conditioning was running very slowly. The table in the room was so narrow, that it was completely unusable for putting a laptop on it to work.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,I was there is September. Air conditioning system works properly. The choice of food for breakfast is not big but enough for a normal breakfast. Very nice and friendly staff. Hotel has a pool working from 10am to 8pm. Very close to main central street - Ledras.,Royiatiko Hotel
50,"The hire car sped along the Cypriot motorway,A travelling bunch of Welshmen to watch Wales away,A crucial qualifying trip, next stop Nicosia,The Cypriot capital and home of KEO beer,Of which much was consumed on this jovial night,A scrappy Welsh victory - oh what delight!The night was young and the KEO consumed,The sambucas were ordered and of course we were doomed,The merry Welshman happy with a fuzzy head,4am rolled round and all thoughts led to bed...So we checked in to the Royaitko,If you're ever in Nicosia, give this hotel a go..Comfy beds and a superb morning meal,All for €69 - a cracking deal.Located in the middle of this beautiful City,We only booked one night - a genuine pity.The pool was warm and welcoming,A refreshing start to this Welshmans morning,A drive back to Paphos was about to ensue,For such a brilliant night in your fine Capital,The Royaitko Hotel - we salute you!",Royiatiko Hotel
20,"Visited Nicosia for 2 days and we stayed at this hotel as is in the old city. My room was really tiny (303), not good ventilation, bathroom, too much noise! My colleague's room was totally ok!Breakfast really average; should be enriched with more local products !",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"I would be lying if I was to say this hotel is easy to find - it's not but that's because it's located in the maze of 1 way streets near the North/South Border.The hotel itself is very comfortable, big rooms and great facilities within the rooms and around the hotel.The pool is a perfect size, the staff were fantastic (especially night porter Tony) & very friendly.The trip across the border required passports and was great fun - we enjoyed a meal on both the North and South side whist here.This is a value for money hotel & I would definitely recommend it as a base for a short visit.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,We expended two nights in this hotel and they were amazing.The hotel is located just 20 meters away from the pedestrian street. The hotel was clean and perfect. The owner was really helpful and made everything possible to make our stay in Nicosia Perfect.The swimming pool was a really good option to beat the heat of summer!Really recommendable,Royiatiko Hotel
40,"We book one night.The hotel it's in the city center, so it have a good localization and have a parking. We rent a car so it's good to have a parking.Stuff is nice.Have a small swiminpool, but it's enough for a refreshing bath.The room it's clean.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"This is a centrally located hotel, relatively new. Modern rooms have small balconies, a/c and fridge. Other reviewers have complained about breakfast and the pool. Breakfast is average for Cyprus but not particularly bad either. The pool is small and shallow, but I don't think any other hotel in the old town has a pool at all, and you wouldn't want to spend a holiday in Nicosia, so this is perfectly fine. Free parking is a plus. Friendly staff. Above all, rooms are very quiet despite being steps away from Ledra Street. Considering the price, this is a recommended place if you have to stay in the capital.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,The hotel is located in a a lively area on Lydra street ... 5 mnts away from the turkish Cyprus and main bus station.Clean and hospitable staff with good internet connection.What I would like to see is more food variety on breakfast buffet,Royiatiko Hotel
40,"The hotel is next to the main street Lydras. The hotel rooms are very nice. Clean and tidy. The breakfast is unacceptable. Very poor and I am not sure it was very fresh. The staff was friendly and helpful. The area is always noisy and prefer rooms at top levels If you want to sleep. The air-condition was not turned into cold, even though at night the temperature was more than 25 degrees. In general, I was not very satisfied and perhaps I try another hotel next time.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"If you want to stay in the heart of the city, just next to the pedestrian zone of Nicosia, Royiatiko is the place to be. It's a rather small family type hotel with just over 30 rooms. They only serve breakfast (buffet), no lunch or diner. There also is a small swimming pool.Rooms are nice, not fancy but ok. Wifi works great an is avaiable everywhere.Everything is very clean. Rather classic style.Helpful people.When you come by (rented) car, they even offer a parking space nextdoors for free !",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"excellent location,very close to the city centre!!friendly and helpful staff..the wifi connection was not good at all in the rooms..the breakfast was poor..although the room was cleaned everyday,i am not sure if this is cleaned well",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"The hotel is just steps away from the busiest shopping street of Nicosia, with many nearby restaurants and cafés. That is clearly the biggest advantage of the hotel. If arriving by car, you can park free at a guarded place about 50 meters away from the hotel. The lobby was simple yet well managed, the room was however very much average. Variety of the breakfast was poor. An outside pool opens from the lobby, but it was too cold in April to try it.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,I stayed here because of an international meeting in Nicosia. The organizers selected 3 hotels we could choose from. Reading the reviews on Tripadvisor I decided to choose this hotel. I did not have any expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Room was good and clean and good bed. I slept excelently. The hotel is in the center. The wifi was great. Free and in all rooms. Breakfasst was sufficient. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room.,Royiatiko Hotel
30,Just wanted a room to spend the night and this hotel was cheap with reasonably well ratings. Was centrally located and close to the venue where my programmed seminar was taking place.+Reasonable price+Central location+Comfortable room-Average breakfast,Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Nice hotel in old city just few steps from shops and restaurants. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms a bit to small and gym, Swimmingpool shut be open all year. I will stay there again if I will be around.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"We slept very soundly on the third floor of this clean hotel, very well situated next to the main area of the walled town. We especially liked the comfortable beds - firm but not too hard - and the walk in shower. Staff are very friendly too. We will return.Helpful hints:1. Ask for a high up room, but despite the central location the street is quiet.2. Ask for underground parking when booking or you leave your car in an open car park.3. The hot breakfast is not a highlight - but the croissants are! Stick to continental.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Royiatiko Hotel is located in the center of downtown. All the visiting places are on walking distance including market, restaurants, transportation etc. The food is good, hotel also have swimming pool and gym. The rooms are pretty much good sized and clean. You can also visit the Turkish part of Cyprus which is yet again not far from hotel.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Nicosia does not offer a lot of hotels.This was a perfectly priced location lending itself to both tourists and businesses. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. I especially welcomed the front desk assistance numerous times with printing, PDF'ing etc. - all with no charge! We used the laundry across the street as found the pricing for in room service to be quite pricey. The breakfast is weak - but didn't affect us as we don't normally have breakfast. Coffee from machine was surprisingly good! We were there at the end of June and the pigeon problem in the pool was in high gear - no desire to take a swim despite the 40 degree heatwave then - thus the reason for my 4 star rating. I would return again because of acceptable pricing, great location and wonderful staff.",Royiatiko Hotel
50,"Idealy situated, modern, very clean. The staff is so nice, friendly and helpfull. 20 meters to the old town but very calm. I enjoyed the swiming pool for a rest when it get too hot middle of the day.I highly recommend this hotel even if you'r traveling solo like me, you feel like home !",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"The hotel is a very good place to visit the old town. Old Nicosie is not so large, and it's possible to visit it by foot from the hotel, even the North Part of the city.The hotel is well equipped, modern and comfortable. The pool is large and a ball was even provided to play with.The parking is not easy to find at first, but it seems guarded, at least during the day.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,Perhaps the best thing about this hotel is its location. You are literally maybe 40 metres from Ledra St. Other than that the rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms clean. One thing I did find off putting was the mattress on the bed which I found a little uncomfortable. Internet was free and was fast and reliable.,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Generally is OK. I liked the room, comfortable and with enough space. The breakfast is the worst point. And, in a city-break, I like a good breakfast before going for a walk. The place is quiet and nearby you can enjoy nice restaurants and a shopping area. You can also see a little of the buffer zone. You'll remember what you liked in Nicosia and the hotel will not harm your memory of what you enjoyed.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"We live on island and stayed for a couple of nights whilst visiting Nicosia. This hotel ticks all the boxes for a city stay. Just off Ledra Street so great for shopping and easy to walk over the border to the North side. The room was bright, clean and nicely furnished with a big comfy bed. We had a balcony that wrapped around the side as we were in a corner room, there wasn't great views as it was other buildings but what would you expect in the city. The breakfast was ok, The staff were friendly and helpful and even when breakfast had finished they offered to warm us more croissants and coffee was endless. We didn't use the pool. Free parking and no need to use your car as everything is within walking distance. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to visit Nicosia.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"The hotel is placed in the center of Nicosia, and has very clean and comfortable rooms. It has a poll that you can enjoy too. The breakfast is not excellent, but it is very nice. The staff is professional and available at any moment. There is a free private parking near the hotel too, which can save you time, as it is difficult to find parking at the area.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"A clean, comfortable and straightforward hotel with fair facilities and very helpful staff in the centre of Nicosia. There can be some noise from the street (e.g. bin collection 4.30am) but it's not excessive, and more than made up for by the convenient location of the hotel. The only real complaint I had was that the bed, which seemed fairly firm at first, was softly sprung and bowed under my weight (84kg), which didn't help my back. Nice bar/breakfast area with option of sitting outside next to the pool. On balance would recommend.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Very central next to the main pedestrian street (Lidra) and shoping area. Very small rooms. Parking facilities. Basic breakfast. Nice swimming pool. Good price on March. Helpfull staff, a bit noisy. Very good location!",Royiatiko Hotel
30,Hotel was average with no many facilities in a quiet small road. Breakfast is fine rooms are not big and there is a heater for coffee. The surrounding area is becoming popular as many cafes and other stores are in close distance.,Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Overall very nice experience at Royatiko. Staff was very welcoming and helpful. As we stayed there off-season, the hotel was very quiet and we had time to talk with manager who is half from Lebanon. Nice swimming pool. Rooms are modern, not too spacious but very clean. Location is in the old town just off the main shopping street. Internet access in the room works with cable only. In the Lobby its Wifi. Gym is in the basement and well equipped. Overall, the hotel is a small pearl in the busy city of Nicosia.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Royiatiko hotel is a clean, friendly place to stay in the old city of Nicosia. You really can't beat the location. It is right off the main road ""Ledras"" and a short walk to the border crossing if you want to go to Northern Cyprus for an hour or so. My only complaint was that breakfast was very lacking. We were glad to have brought our own food with us, as there wasn't much choice available, and what was available wasn't that great.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Stayed in this hotel in Late September. This small hotel is spotless, with lovely friendly staff, and ideal location just off the pedestrianised area. The swimming pool is tiny but a welcome relief from the heat of the city. Short walk to bars, shops and a wide range of cafes. There was some minor building work ongoing to make an entrance/exit from the swimming pool area. A bit noisy but it should be finished by now. I would be happy to stay in this hotel if I were to visit Nicosia again.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Honestly, the only advantage of this hotel is its location. Being located right next to Ledras str., gives you the opportunity to make a walk and visit the market in just 1 min walking distance.But...the rooms are large but rather overpriced.The quantity and variety at the breakfast buffet was not equal to 100 euros that we paid for 1 double room (imagine that this price was an offer !!)In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel for someone who would like to stay at the historical centre of Nicosia, but a room with a breakfast does not worth more than 60-70 euros.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"They must take care to make better coffee....Cyprus has so many fresh products during the summer- they should take part into a colourful breakfast table!!Marmelades, honney, yogurt, cherries....",Royiatiko Hotel

40,"The small hotel is located in the inner city of Nicosia. It was lately modernized and offers a really warm and friendly atmosphere. The rooms are clean, breakfast is standard, the pool is very satisfiying and the people working at the hotel are very friendly, sometimes helpful.Only the neighbourhood is a little bit noisy and partly rundown. But if you walk two blocks you find yourself in very nice streets with good cafes, bars and restaurants.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"well this hotel is in a great location, steps away from bus station pedestrian walkway filled with shops and bars and restaurants, museums and churches. The staff is extremely helpful, and sweet, breakfast was good, rooms were great just tight in the shower, and the pool was a blessing to have since it was so hot here in june. overall no complaints and i think u will enjoy it",Royiatiko Hotel
40,Stayed for seven nights on business. Small modern hotel with all facilities. Just remember to ask for a room facing the small street or the pool (not used at night).Rooms facing the parking lot are unfortunately disturbed at night by a taverna bar on opposite side where there is partying going on every day but sunday...,Royiatiko Hotel
30,"Lonely planet has this hotel, as a top choice for Lefkosia area. I was not impressed by the value of the hotel for the price. We had problems with the safe, for which we received the master key, to open and close it (not a good security process). The rest. was not open, although it appears in their leaflets, along with Lonely Planet's. While it is close the pedestrian area, which is a good place to start the walled walks, the immediate area around is not so nice. And parking is about 100 meters away.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"This is my fourth stay at the hotel this year. I really like it here. The rooms are clean and well decorated and the beds very comfortable. The location is excellent - right in the heart of Nicosia. The staff are delightful and really friendly which is particularily welcoming for a lone business traveller. And of course fantastic to have an outdoor pool to cool down in as Nicosia can get extremely hot. The breakfasts are not spectacular and it can be noisy (they emply the municipal bins on the corner at 4.00 in the morning), but these are just small bug bares. It is certainly the nicest place I've stayed in Nicosia and i will definitely be back............",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"The Royiatiko Hotel is a great option for those who want a comfortable hotel right in the middle of the old town. The main pedestrian mall is one block away, and the border crossing is about a 5 min walk away along the pedestrian mall. Once we found the hotel (the directions on the hotel's website are extremely complicated and we got lost on the way), we were able to see all the sights on foot.The hotel itself feels new and is comfortable, despite having rooms on the smaller side (though the mini fridge was a plus). It is on a fairly quiet corner, and we were not disturbed by any noises at night. There is a small but really nice pool just behind the lobby and bar/restaurant, which is great for hanging out day or night (with the free wifi). The bar/breakfast service was excellent and friendly.A few minor nits: Very hard to find (lots of one way streets). Parking is a block away (down a one way street) in an unguarded lot. No doorman. Wired internet in the room never worked. Stairhall light timer is manual, so be careful in the dark!But these are minor complaints, and we enjoyed our stay very much,",Royiatiko Hotel
20,"I stayed one night in the Royiatiko hotel and am happy I didn't staylonger. The hotel is located in a run down, seedy part of downtown. Allnight long I heard cars drive by with their stereo blaring Greek music.Checkin area is not air-conditioned; they have a floor fan to cool thatarea. That should have tipped me off. The room has paper thin walls. Iwas located 4 rooms down from the elevator yet everytime it pinged to myfloor, I heard it as if it opened its doors in my room. Noise is notmuffled since the floors are not carpetted, not in the hallway and notin the room. The minibar is empty. If you want a drink you have to bringit with you or go to the bar. The furniture is early-neo-Euro-trash -everything is leather bordered from the bed, to the mirror frame. Thereis not a single printed item in the room. No brochures. No tourist booksof what to do. The more I think about it, I should have asked for thehourly rate.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"We stayed for one night at the Royiatiko Hotel while visiting Nicosia when holidaying in Cyprus. To find the hotel by car you do need a good street map and luck. There are a lot of one way streets.The hotel's car parking is a bit of space land hidden away down a narrow street. The hotel is nicely placed close to the old town and shopping area. Inside the reception,bar/resturant areas are nice and cool air conditioned and nicely furnished.The staff were friendly and helpful. They do have a problem with unwanted pigeons around the pool area which will need to sorted some how.",Royiatiko Hotel

50,"I stayed at thr Royiatiko for two weeks in march on business, I found it to be a very good hotel and very close to every thing by foot.The staff are very helpful and nothing is to much trouble,the hotel is kept very clean both inside and out, the pool and a well equipt gym are the icing on the cake.I was very dissapointed when I had to extend my stay and they had no vacancies.I would stay here again without any hesitation.",Royiatiko Hotel
40,"Well, we really enjoyed the hotel, unlike some of the other reviewers. Very clean, friendly, modern, free internet etc. Was a bit of a mission finding the place without satnav but free parking 20 metres away (ask for ticket at reception). We thought breakfast was good, bread, jams, meats, cheeses, cereals, scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit etc. All the shops and restaurants are on the doorstep and Nicosia's a very interesting place for strolling around. Really enjoyed the stay.",Royiatiko Hotel
10,"We stayed in the hotel with my husband when we visited the island for a conference. The hotel offers all the advantages of a brand new establishment. The materials used are in excellent condition.Moreover, it is very close to down town which is very convenient. On the other hand there may be some noise if the room is on the front side. If one is noise sensitive, should definitely avoid the rooms overseeing the swimming pool (rear side) as there is the breakfast / coffee area with a t.v. This enclosed yard, unfortunately functions as a speaker, intensifying all noises. The rooms are small, as it is customary with the new hotels nowadays. Considering the size of the bedrooms, the bathrooms are spacious which is an advantage. The breakfast is basic. (Holidays' Inn offers a superior buffet, but two years ago the rooms were in bad condition with 1980s pieces). There are too many textiles used in the window drapery, and too many pillows on the bed, -one is not sure what to do with them or where to place them, in order to sleep on the bed-, but then again I guess this 19th century victorian custom, is our society's proof of luxury. Fortunately there is no carpet on the floor, a situation which balances the dust that is obviously accumulated on the heavy draperies.We would not have been bothered with all the above since we love Nicosia a great deal(we placed the pillows in the wardrobe and left our clothes in the luggage) and we enjoy visiting. Under normal circumstances our interaction with the staff would have been indifferent. Nothing exceptional.However, early in the morning the day we were scheduled to leave, a colleague stopped by and left for us a parcel. The receptionist forgot to inform us about it. We left without he parcel and I only found out about it when, upon my return to my desk in Greece, I found an e-mail from my colleague with questions about the material. I called the manager and complained. I do not remember whether she actually did apologize or not because even if she typically used the words ""we are sorry"" I was infuriated by the tone of her voice which was shockingly rude. The manager tried to stop my complaints by accusing me that I make a big deal of the case and such things happen and should be expected (If I could only tell that to my clients!). Ok! so far so good, I could live with this mishappening. I requested the parcel to be shipped to me. I do not know what shipping and mailing system they used, yet ten days later I still have not received it. The manager does not return my calls and a receptionist replied that it must have been lost in the mail. Even if I were to accept that mistakes happen they should have tried to put an end to their mistakes, they could have at least used a reliable courier, even if that means they would have to pay for it.",Royiatiko Hotel
10,"On July 2010, we booked through ""booking.com"", 2 rooms for September 2010 for three nights, but when we arrived at the hotel Royiatiko, they told us that no rooms were available because the agency ""booking.com"" did not informed them about our booking. Please note that the next morning the management of the hotel informed the agency of ""not shown"". They were spelling rediculus causes with no excuse or explanation.Our opinion is that both firms are not reliable.",Royiatiko Hotel
30,"I was excited reading the reviews left about the Royiatiko Hotel. The bedrooms are small, but very modern and kept very clean. The bar staff are really lovely and friend. I was disgusted when we used the outside facilites, the swimming pool is very small, it looks big on their advertisement. It is constantly surrounded by pigeons and if you want to have a swim, you will have to push the odd feather out of the road as well as not put your feet down in the pool in case you walk on birds crap. Not impressed.For sunbathers, the pool area only gets full sunshine from 12.30pm-5pm, it has no sun up until then due to high rised buildings.When you want to see the manager, she is always too busy.The gym has no air-con, so if you are planning a work out, forget it.I would NOT stay here again.",Royiatiko Hotel

Phones also worked fine both in the room & mobile connection....Excellent choice & standard of eateries close by & great range of boutiques & shops in the little streets surrounding the hotel which are wonderful to meander through & come alive with local families & tourists at night....If you like the personal touch want to feel like you actually matter then come here & enjoy!If you prefer the more aloof & impersonal approach of some of the larger hotels where you are treated like one of the herd - don't bother....I'll be back as soon as I can be....",Royiatiko Hotel

The location is nice in the old part of the town - we always waked home which is a nice experience in the small roads of the old town. Sadly neither the phone nor the wireless was working - so no recommendation for business travelers. The breakfast was so la la, but the service was nice. There is no 24h reception service. I will try to find something else next time in Nicosia.",Royiatiko Hotel

Room was nice, with everything you need and the location was good - in old city but not in the middle of the tourist area. Very good hotel for business I'd say.",Royiatiko Hotel
