40,Situated in a local neighborhood. Cozy (small) clean rooms with modern bathrooms. Pleasant atmosphere with a courtyard and delicious breakfast. Excellent WiFi although limited electrical outliets for charging devices. It has many maps and brochures for Northern Cyprus available at reception. English is exremely limited and the assistant isn’t knowledgable about visiting sites or public transportation.Note: The location can be difficult to find. I did not have a SIM card for this Cyprus area and my printed Google Map got me lost. I am attaching a map photo to help if you are walking from the Green Line.,Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"My wife and I must have stayed at the Swallow Boutique hotel 4 or 5 times now. We have done so with friends, with family, and just the two of us. We have also travelled to it, both by car and on foot having crossed at the Ledras Street crossing.Every time has been a really personalised experience. On an island crammed full of massive resort-style hotels, there are few places that give a really traditional and intimate experience. The Swallow really is one of those that does. It is a very good place to stay for exploring both sides of Nicosia.Special mention must go to the breakfasts, which are some of the finest I've had in Cyprus.I am 100% certain that the next time we are in Nicosia for a weekend getaway, it will be the Swallow we stay with again.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"Cypriot Swallow Hotel is situated in a superbly renovated building and has 3 rooms that open onto an internal courtyard. The whole interior is bright and cheerful, it has been charmingly decorated, is full of plants and interesting objects and feels very homely. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean. We had the Bougainvillea room - the room itself was not huge but there was a good sized wardrobe and drawers and we also had a small private entrance lobby which gave us quite a bit of extra space. There was a fridge, kettle air con, hairdryer etc - everything you need. The double bed was comfortable and the wifi was good. The bathroom was well equipped and plenty of hot water in the shower. There was a little noise from the street during the evening but it stopped about midnight and didn’t cause us any problems. Service was good although we only met one member of staff - Dudu gave us a great welcome, plenty of advice, and helped us find a parking space for the hire car. There was no private parking and we had to park a couple of streets away so were sllightly worried about the hire but everything was fine. It was no problem to leave our luggage for a few hours after check out and come back for it later. The breakfast was amazing - a traditional Cypriot array of different cheeses, jams etc which were all freshly prepared and we could choose what time we wanted it. It is served in the courtyard if the weather is good or in the inside breakfast room if not. Location is good - it is inside the city walls in the northern Turkish part of Lefkosa; 3 minutes walk from Kyrenia Gate, and is close to the historical centre and the main attractions. It is close enough to the Ledra Street border crossing to walk even with a lot of luggage. It is easy to find when driving as long as you have a good map. Other people have complained about the area but we did not have a problem with it, it was poor but old and authentic and the people were friendly. The price was more than we normally pay but comparable with other properties so no complaint. We only spent one night here as a stopover before crossing to the south for the second half of our trip but would love to come back and spend longer another time.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
40,very clean room & very friendly front desk. We stayed there 2 nights. It locates nearby old town with walking distance. Hotel owner helped with all the requests we had. Excellent experience for our stay.,Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
40,"First please do not be put off by a recent Belgium reviewer because I find it incredible that anyone booking a hotel in N.Cyprus could be unaware of the turbulent history of Cyprus which has resulted in this divided island. Secondly I do not think it is unreasonable for any hotel anywhere to not refund for a booking if the booking is cancelled on the day of arrival and I think that the delightful owners had every right to do so.When we arrived in the area we were a little apprehensive because it really is in downtown N.Nicosia but when we turned the corner there was the hotel looking just like the photographs. We were assured that our hire car would be quite safe and it was. We were greeted by very friendly lady who served us with a very welcome cup of tea ( no alcohol served on premises ). I believe there are only 3 or 4 rooms in hotel and we were given the Jasmine room. Nice size with fridge & tea making facilities. Bathroom good size too but beware of door stopper sticking. Only complaint was because of the heat a sheet rather than duvet would have been more suitable and, as is quite common abroad, there wasn't a plug in washbasin. The aircon is quiet enough to leave on during the night. There is a lovely courtyard where smokers can imbibe, not so good to sit in if you don't. Breakfast is traditional Turkish and most people would find something that they would like, breakfast can also be requested to be served at particular times. If we stay in the area again we would certainly stay here because, although it is in a poor area, we felt quite safe and everybody we met showed us such friendliness.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,We had a lovely holiday in this sweet boutique hotel. The hospitality that they showed us was amazing. They arranged our pickup from the airport and try to help us with our every need. The breakfast was varied and traditional we didnt need much to eat afterwards during the day until late afternoon. This boutique hotel is definitely on our checklist next time we visit cyprus.,Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"We had a lovely time in this sweet boutique hotel. The breakfast was really delicious and homemade. It reflected the hospitality of cyprus we heard so much of. The boutique hotel was in the heart of Nicosia so it was easy to walk everywhere. The owner Birgul was very friendly and warm towards us, she arranged us shuttle service from the airport and took care of all our transportind needs. We definitely plan on staying here next time we visit cyprus",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"Cypriot swallow boutique hotel was a lovely place to stay. We enjoyed it very much. Rooms were comfortable and quite big. The breakfast they offered was delicious and traditional. It kept us full until late. The owner Birgul was very friendly and kind, she showed us true hospitality. As my recommendation this boutique hotel is definitely worth the price, and I plan to stay here on my next visit to Cyprus.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"Cypriot swallow boutique hotel was in the heart of Nicosia, in the old city. I walked everywhere easily. Owner Birgul was very helpful and the management arranged my transport from the airport which was pleasant. My room was comfartable and their traditional breakfast was delicious.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
10,"We tried t reach the hotel, but as it is in the invaded part from Cyprus, taxis from the cypriot side cannot cross the borders and you have to take a taxi from the turkish parts Very hard to find the hotel because there are no indications, thouth they claim it is very close to the border.. They will ask a fortune for that. We had to contact the hotel by pohone but each time youion may turn have to pay an international call, so a cheap hotel night will cost you very expensive. Also they earn money not allowing to cancel the reservation, since lots of people may desist like us. Foreign people do not have the real idea of Nicosia situation before they know the city. So my husband came to the hotel with bags over my wheelchair (I waited in the cypriot part) , the lady does not speak english, he explained our difficults to get there with luggage and wheelchair,but she did not care, did not offer help to bring us to the Turkish side and we prefer to cancel. It was cheaper and more dconfortable to loose this reservation and rent on the other side.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"This is a beautiful little hotel, with excellent rooms located round a small courtyard where you can read and relax in the sun or under an awning. The staff were very helpful and friendly, and they provided an excellent Cypriot breakfast with home made jams. This simple and elegant hotel isn't in a very glamorous area, but the neighbourhood is old, authentic and very conveniently located.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
40,"Only 15 minutes stroll from the Ledra St crossing, near Girne Gate, this was a pleasant and comfortable stay for our one night. Although the room wasn't large, it was big enough to fit in a portable bed for our daughter, and was quite neat and very clean.The host was really nice and rang a couple of times for us when the rental car company was late in delivery. After an adequate breakfast she happily made extra coffees for us as we waited, and was so cheerful about it.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"I stayed for 1 night in this hotel. I wanted to stay in the Turkish side of Nicosia. The hotel is located in a quiet area, about 10-15 minutes walking from the Buyuk Khan and the border crossing point in Ledras street. The room was not big but very nice. Good shower, comfortable bed. A bottle of water and a tea kettle in the room. The breakfast was very good, the owner herself and her daughter kindly took care of that for me. Wifi worked well. A charming place.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"I had a few days work in Northern Cyprus so needed somewhere where I could stay and travel to Kyrenia and Famagusta from as well as do business in the Turkish side of Nicosia. I chose this hotel after looking through Trip Advisor reviews, I was not disappointed. I chose to stay here on the Turkish side of the city as all my work was on this side of the island I thought it would be easier.The hotel is small and down a narrow street in old Nicosia, very atmospheric. The hotel is spotless, cheerfully painted. It has only four rooms, you are going to get personal service, how much nicer than a big corporate hotel is this?! Simple facilities, clean, reliable Wi-fi and a lovely Cypriot breakfast served with a charming smile. The bedrooms are light and airy with high ceilings, I slept well, no traffic noise at all.The hotel is situated not far from a square with cafes and restaurants where I ate in the evening. It is a short walk into the Turkish Old Town or a ten minute lazy stroll to the crossing into the Greek half of the city.The hotel arranged for early morning taxis for me each day, useful as I had to travel around Northern Cyprus to different places working. Staying a few days in the hotel helped me build up a rapport with the staff. They were wonderful. Turkish hospitality is special and I'm so glad I stuck to my guns and chose this hotel rather than the larger one on the Greek side my company wanted to book, I'd go back there again on holiday knowing I'd get a warm welcome.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"The Swallow guest house is an easy walk from the Ledra Street crossing point through the shopping area. It is also near to the start of the buses to Kyrenia and Famagusta.The whole place is very well decorated ,very clean and our towels were changed every day. We also had a had a fridge and kettle in our room.Breakfast although continental had a very large selection starting with various cereals and tea or coffee.Yes I would certainly like to stay at this place again",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"After slumming it in a few places, this was really refreshing. A beautiful building, friendly staff and really cosy bed. Even a working shower;-)About a 10 minute trot to town, and a decent breakfast.Really good value for money, would stay again.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"A great place to stay within the old walled city of Nicosia. Walking distance to all the major attractions and highlights in the Turkish part of Nicosia. It's only a 15 minute walk maximum to the crossing point at Ledra street. The hotel is very quiet and clean. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Great breakfast, made fresh every morning.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"The Swallow hotel is a little gem hidden away in Old Nicosia. My room was comfortable, bright and incredibly clean. In walking distance of lots of restaurants and tourist attractions. The breakfast was spectacular.Really friendly and welcoming host. Perfect",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
40,"Hidden away in the Turkish half of the old city of Lefkosia (Nicosia) is this charming, three roomed bed and breakfast. Be prepared for their authentic Turkish breakfast. Tudu, the receptionist/everything, is brilliant (excellent English). Don't be put off by its surrounding buildings.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,Cypriot swallow is definitely one of the most charming hotels I have stayed at so far. It has only three rooms which are all around a calm courtyard. The whole place is beautifully designed with lots of attention to detail. All areas are very clean and tidy. The set breakfast is served in the courtyard. Service is perfect (the hotel is run by a lady and her two daughters) with a very kind and personal approach.The only downside: We got two separate beds instead of a king size or double bed.,Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
40,"This is a small bed and breakfast in a slightly out of the way part of the Northern side of Nicosia. Although simple, it is clean and very comfortable, and all the rooms are furnished to a good standard for a B&B. In particular the bathrooms are smart with good showers, and the beds are extremely comfortable.The rooms themselves are fairly small, so it's not necessarily somewhere you'd want to sit around during the day, but it makes a great base for exploring the old town.The highlight, as other reviewers have noted, was a lovely freshly-prepared Turkish/Cypriot breakfast in the morning.My only criticism would be that the television didn't appear to work, and that despite booking a double room we were given a twin.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"I been there for 2 nights. Trust me, it was wonderful!!!! She's(Birgul, the host) such an amazing artist and architect. When we got there we were extremely tired but she greeted us warmly and brought us lemonade & coffee. One of our traditional musics was playing there too (so wise!). I will never forget those 2spicial breakfast. To be honest, I didn't like the city at all but the place was nice. no doubt, book this!",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
30,"We booked a stay for 21-23 January, having looked for somewhere different to stay in Turkish Nicosia as part of a longer stay in both parts of the island.The Cyprus Boutique Hotel is close to the Kyrenia Gate, but is tucked away on an offshoot of Resadiye Street. We were travelling on foot from the Gate and overshot it - luckily two very helpful locals drove us there! As advertised it is a (small one storey) courtyard house, with a reception room and small breakfast room at the front and the remaining bedrooms accessible from the courtyard. There is a clurtyard table and a blind for hot weather - we were there in an exceptionally cold period for the island and so were pleased to be able to eat inside.Our room had one shuttered window and so was quite dark when this was closed. The bathroom doesn't have any heating - a towel rail would have been useful - and so was cold first thing. There were minor maintenance issues - the colour TV was bw only and there were lightbulbs that needed replacing. But the staff member was friendly, the breakfast good, town maps to help you get around in good supply and the hotel does have character.However it is a brave venture, situated at the northern end of the poorest part of the walled city. The nearest place to eat was a very local café, providing good service to migrant and local working people. So you either have to walk to very close to the Green line for restaurants (we found only two open, but this was January) or cross to the Greek part of the city.But if you don't mind the walk this did seem to be the best option inside the walls!",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"I don't know how l can start to say something about this place, because I have many experience in this place and very funny anyway place is not easy to find but really breakfast very Delicious stuff is very kind price is normal inside in room very good decorative design is very very beautiful otantrik and romantic you feel you stay in your home around here 24 hours open shop, restaurants, what you want you can find very easy..I want say thank you for lady owners she is Engineer she make really really very good place very kind stuff lady "" Dudu "" thank you again again......! I wish best for this place, l want again again here",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"We enjoyed a day sightseeing in Lefkosa (North Cyprus side of Nicosia). We were flying out of Ercan on a 6.30 am flight, so booked a night at the Cypriot Swallow to allow for an easy 20 minute cab to the airport. We loved this place from even before we arrived at the front door. We walked with two large wheeled bags from the Ledra Street Border Crossing and it's do-able - but a taxi could have been warranted. The neighbourhood, like much of Nicosia is a bit grim - but the hotel is beautifully plastered, painted white and has teal accents - easy to see even from a distance. We received a warm welcome from Tudu on Reception and she made us lovely tea and biscuits, showed us our room (which was thankfully ready early when we arrived at 10 am), advised that the water, snacks and juice in the fridge was included in our rate, booked our 4 am taxi and offered to make us a sandwich and put it in the fridge so we didn't entirely miss out on breakfast due to our early departure. Phew - friendly efficiency at its finest. When we returned from sightseeing a few hours later, sandwiches were there as promised. The room was not large... two people, two bags, cabin bags and there was just some room to move about. The bathroom was actually half as large as the room. The beds were comfy, the linens nice. A lot of effort has gone into the clean, fresh, modern decorations and we appreciated it. A friend from the UK spits chips if she doesn't get a hairdryer and a full length mirror (even in developing countries where she's paying 20 euros a night). She would have been ecstatic here with dryer, mirror etc. The water had excellent pressure and was piping hot. We don't normally pay more than 40 euros a night to stay pretty much anywhere... so 60 euros was a bit extra for us - but - the inclusions, the warm welcome and flat out great service made the rate worth every penny. The taxi that Tudu arranged arrived spot on the dot of 4 am, was a clean and well maintained Mercedes with an excellent driver and the ride to the airport took exactly 20 minutes. This is a great little B&B (and I mean little... only 4 rooms) - we will return if we need another overnight spot heading in/out of Ercan.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
40,"This is a nice, small hotel in the north of the city. It can be a little hard to find at first: follow the quiet street just before the end of the inner walled city where a few restaurants are until just after it turns around a little. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast was also very nice and the price reasonable. The people running the hotel are friendly and can speak enough English.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"One of the few cheaper hotels/apartments that I could find on the North side of Nicosia. The price we paid was very reasonable. Three of us used it as a stop over before flying out of Ercan early the next day.Although not the easiest place to find it is well situated for exploring the North side of Nicosia. The accommodation is simple, clean and well furnished, wifi is freely available.I can't comment on the breakfast as we left very early but the owner did offer to get up and make us sandwiches! She also booked us a taxi for 04:30hrs and it was there on time!Would definitely use again for the comfort, price and convenience.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
50,"Stayed for one night at Swallow Boutique hotel in Nicosia.Wonderfully presented in the style of Old Cyprus, the hotel is traditional but endowed with modern comfort.The rooms are clean and well appointed.A highlight is the fresh breakfast which is nothing short of delicious.Only drawback is the hotel is a little to find, but would recommend without hesitation for those considering quaint and memorable stay.",Cypriot Swallow Boutique Hotel
