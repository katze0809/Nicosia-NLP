40,"At Sky Hotel you get what you'd expect: an average midrange Hotel as advertised. The rooms are small with add-in tiny private bathroom. The rooms have a TV with a couple of local and international stations and a mini bar (fridge). The room I stayed in had a nice little terrace-like balcony with a view of neighboring buildings and it was seperated by a small wooden privacy shield from the next rooms balcony.The AC works great and you get the remote for the TV and AC upon check-in (where you also have to return it at check-out).The check-in and out process was quick, efficent and friendly. The friendliness of the staff is by far the one extraordinary thing you get when staying at the hotel.The hotel is conviently situated near Ledras street within a pedestrian area of Nicosia, only about 700 meters from the crossing into the northern part. Unfortunately it also means that there is no parking available at the Hotel. Next possible public parking is located 5 min by foot next to the central bus station that costs 0.50€ each hour, also during the night.My rate didn't inlcude breakfast but this can be found easily in several locations within only a few minutes walking distance or directly in the adjacent Lebanese Restaurant that is rather recommended for dinner with regular belly dance performances.Only really downside is that all power outlets shut down when you leave the room and take the metallic key tag out of the corresponding plug. No way to charge any appliances during the day or to keep food refrigerated. As a concerned citizen of the world I agree to save energy. There's no need to keep lights on or even the AC running during the day out in the city, but it would be great if the fridge as well as one outlet would stay connected at all times even without the key tag in the wall.",Sky Hotel
30,"We got the last room, it was not ready, toilet didn’t work, and just was a disappointment. I gave it a terrible review. The staff moved us in the morning to a very acceptable room. We stayed an additional two days. The attached restaurant was very good. Service was good after a scathing review, I need to remember to give the staff a chance before the ax",Sky Hotel
50,I really liked this place. A comfortable clean room 1 block from Ledras Street and a short walk to everything you want to see in the old town. Staff was friendly Desk was open 24-7 and there is a nice restaurant downstairs Reasonable priced. Not sure why it is only a 2 star hotel. It was nicer that some 3 stars I've stayed in,Sky Hotel
30,We stayed here two nights in a 3 persons room.Pros- Big rooms- Centrally located- Good breakfast across the street in restaurant- Big balconyConsClimate control is hard to setShower has no shampooceiling shower is dirty with mold,Sky Hotel
40,"Just a basic hotel with basic amenities. Location is great - 500 meters from bus station, and already in oldtown area. Charming neighborhood. No breakfast, but next to hotel there is few restaurants and taverns.",Sky Hotel
30,Was alone but was given a huge room with quite a few beds in so I had plenty of space. Could do with some renovation work or perhaps just removing some of the decorations and pictures in the rooms. The location is perfect for all the bars and restaurants nearby.,Sky Hotel
30,"All staff are very friendly and you can not get a better location for the old town of Nicosia or Lefkosia as the Greeks call it now. It is one street away from Ledra street which is the Main Street down to the green line/ border which you can cross to the Turkish side but the hotel itself is a bit basic but the beds are comfortable and bed linen and towels are great, they do not do breakfast in the hotel anymore but you can go a cross the road to another hotel but apart from that you have loads of choice all around for cafés",Sky Hotel
30,My room was on the third floor in a hotel without an elevator. The room was large and had a huge balcony. The 2nd and third floors have 5 rooms with great balconies overlooking a pedestrian street. The showers were weak otherwise the place was a bargain. It was walk to the border crossing on Ledra Street. I would stay there again.,Sky Hotel
10,"The room was dirty, dust shown everywhere and a nasty smell and fresh straings looking stain on wall and funiture, Hairs all over the toliet, mold growning around the sink, shower cabine and odd looking peices of trash on the floor.. The furniture was worn and tired looking, The matras was torned and you could see mold growing!!! In the morning my daughter and Iwhere both feeling sick and had both difficultly breading.",Sky Hotel
20,"Good location with easy access to local eating and drinking spots.Hotel and rooms are a little tired to say the least, it has seen better days a while back.We were there during the week on a rainy day so no street noises and quiet.",Sky Hotel
40,The Hotel is sited centrally and in the best part and liveliest part of Nicosia. The Service was extremely professional and the Hotel within a walking distance of Ledra Gate. Whilst at Hotel pay a visit to adjacent Fanous Lebanese Restaurant run by friendly and courteous Homam and enjoy and relish the Belly dance on Friday and Saturday night _ Great find.,Sky Hotel
40,"The alleyway is a bit unnerving on arrival, but you soon realise it's not so sleazy. Had a big room on 3rd floor ( no lift) with an even bigger terrace. Brilliant for being in the heart of the town, cafes, shops, restaurants all round you. Don't look too closely at cleaning or fixtures and fittings, it's all a bit happy-go-lucky. Basic breakfast in dingy restaurant, but enough to eat. I paid €30 b&b, which was acceptable. Good wifi in the rooms.",Sky Hotel
40,"The hotel is really convenient as it is in the middle of all the action in Nicosia.Its right out side a restaurant which plays live music at night so its really nice to sit on the balcony and listen to.There is no parking on the site but there is a parking place about a 5 minute walk away.The room (we stayed in room 203) was basic but clean, eq160 bags cocoa to pack £65.00uipt with a TV and mini fridge and pretty much all the basic needs like air con etc. The staff were very friendly and kind to us on our visit.In the morning we were greeted by a lovely breakfast of fresh olives, cucumber, tomatoes and a selection of hams and cheeses.Overall really impressed would definitely stay again!",Sky Hotel
30,"Sky hotel is right in yeah heart of old town Nicosia. It is a 10 minute walk to the green line and all of the major tourist sites in the city. The old town is full of great little bars, restaurants and cafes. You can't get better located than Sky Hotel.The hotel itself is nothing special. For 50 euros per night you can't ask for much more. It is clean, has a/c and a TV with a couple of English channels. Our room (202) fronted the street and had a great little balcony. Based on the orientation of the hotel I doubt any other rooms aside from 201 would have a balcony.I would recommend staying here if you are planning to spend most of your time out in the town and just want a place to crash in the evening. Just don't expect much from the hotel itself.",Sky Hotel
30,We stayed here for one night at the beginning of our trip around Cyprus. Nicosia is such a lovely little city & Sky Hotel is perfectly located within it.If you're driving there's no on-site parking so just leave your car in any of the of the small parking lots and walk. It's pretty easy to find.Our room was simple (it's a budget hotel) but clean with a/c and a great balcony with views over the rooftops.Stay here if you're likely to spend all your time out in Nicosia and just need somewhere safe & convenient to walk home to after a day exploring.,Sky Hotel
30,"The Hotel is tucked away down a narrow street crowded with tables and chairs and shaded by the canopies overhanging the street. You have to look carefully for the sign near the hotel's door. I found it surprisingly quiet. The hotel is the perfect starting point for exploring the Old Town and the surround area, a 5 minute walk to the Greek side bus station and a 30 minute walk to the Turkish side's bus station. It is equally close to other attractions as well. It was a comfortable little hotel and I loved the charm of the Old Town's narrow streets and lanes.",Sky Hotel
30,Very central locationWell pricedAbout a 2 star standardGood wifiNice. Restaurants nearby and walking distance to all centre and border crossingRecommended here where hotels are fairly dearNegotiated a room only rateCheaper if you book direct with hotel rather then online,Sky Hotel
30,"This is a budget hotel in an old building but it does have some good positives. The location was excellent as it was right in the middle of the pedestrian area in the centre of Nicosia just a few minutes walk from the bus station.When we arrived we were given a very big room with large balcony but the next day we had to move as someone else had booked it!! We were given the keys of two rooms so we could choose which we wanted.There is free internet in the rooms, a fridge in the room and air conditioning. Our room had a west facing balcony which was lovely to sit on early morning and evening as the sun was going down. There is also a small en suite with shower although the water was rarely hot.The staff were friendly and the lady on reception asked if we would like a kettle in the room or if we wanted anything else.I would stay there again as it was good value ( we didnt have breakfast so the price was less than advertised) but dont expect a plush hotel if you do decide to try it. There is no lift in the hotel.",Sky Hotel
30,"First of all, when it comes to value for money, the hotel scene in Nicosia seems to be much worse than in the rest of the country.That said, this place offers decent value. The rooms are a bit dated, the included breakfast is nothing special and the overall feel is that of a very basic budget hotel. However the place is clean and the location is just brilliant. Easy walking distance to all the main sights, the bus station, the border check point and also close to a big parking field for those with rental cars.",Sky Hotel
40,"This hotel is in Lonely Planet Cyprus edition and we had not intended to stay over in Nicosia. Our visit was to do the touristy bits of the city and then return to our holiday apartment back in Peyia Village. My husband Terry and I felt so excited and spontaneous that we just popped in and discovered they had availability, we saw the room first and it was large with two double beds, a sofa, chairs and plenty of storage space for a longer stay, it was an easy decision.We slept well; staff were exceptionally helpful and cheery.Breakfast was basic but okay.Locality is spot on and the vibe from the city is not imposing on those wishing to rest and sleep, while being in the heart of the city.We travelled on intercity bus service from Paphos for 5 Euro and the station was less than 10 minutes’ walk away.The Green line is also about 10 min's walk along Ledra Street (2 min’s), where North Cyprus is occupied by the Turkish; don't forget to go to the observatory top of Debenhams, Ledra Street..... So worth it paying 2 euros per person on a clear day.",Sky Hotel
30,"It is what it is I suppose. A 'budget' hotel in the centre of Nicosia. Just for comparison, for the same price I stayed at a middle-level hotel in Paphos (Pafos).Location is the best point about this hotel. 10 minutes walk from the bus station. Minimarket nearby.The second good point was the internet.The lady who was at the receptionist desk during the day was quite friendly.As far as the room goes... lighting was a bit poor, the AC in my room did not work, tiles were old, the bathroom gave out a strange smell after i flushed the toilet.Unfortunately, there are not many options for cheap accommodation in (the centre) of Nicosia.If you have to stay in Nicosia, you can either pay 30 euro more per night for a better hotel in the centre of the town or stay somewhere outside the walled city.If you don't have to stay in Nicosia, I'd recommend you stay in Larnaca and make a day trip to Nicosia. The walled city of Nicosia (both north and south) can be seen in 1-2 days depending on how much time you take to take photo's, walk and sit in a cafe.",Sky Hotel
50,"Sky Hotel is a remarkable bargain for the budget traveler. It's modest in its comfortable. The location could not be better. It's right in the center of the pedestrian tourist area. The bus station, the major historic sites and the border to North Nicosia are all within walking distance. It's the perfect choice if you are looking for a good budget hotel, especially if you are traveling without a car. My single room had air conditioning, free wifi, a TV, a mini fridge and a small but adequate bathroom with shower. These extras made it even more of a bargain. I found a supermarket nearby and could eat in my room. The breakfast is extra but has lots of choices. Three nights cost me 129 euro. I was looking for a budget hotel that had the amenities I wanted and was in the right location and Sky Hotel was perfect. The staff was helpful and friendly. I could not have asked for a better experience.",Sky Hotel
30,"Location is good, in the old town. But warning about driving and parking your own car--it sucks so if you have a car maybe it's better to stay in the new town in a hotel with a parking lot if you can! The public parking in the old town has time limits and we did see the police writing tickets so it's worth thinking about.Can't compare Sky to other hotels bc this was my first time in Nicosia. There are very few hotels in the city. So few that I don't even recall seeing more than one or two others. Unfortunately this might just be one of the best bets.Our double room had a sizable balcony, working WiFi connection, and small but good LCD TV. The TVs are, as another reviewer noted, for porn use. Hardcore day and night. A casual surf through the channels and you can't avoid being face to face with a stranger's genitalia. Not sexy at all.Overall the hotel is dumpy dark and dingy. At €60/night without breakfast not exactly a bargain. Service and vibe weird. They do not seem to be in the business of tourism. They have no maps. On the surface they are decently friendly but if you have any question they just shrug shoulders, like ""I dunno,"" without even making an effort to help. For instance, we asked where to park our car and they say ""I dunno? I parking lot?"" Ask again, ""Which one is good for overnight?"" Answer: Shrug shoulders.To end on a positive note, crossing the border into the Turkish occupied zone is a wonderful experience and should not be missed--the architecture is wonderful and it is interesting to see how life goes on as normal in spite of the conflict. Also, there is a great bar/resto around the corner from the hotel called Plato's. Nicosia is a neat place to visit.",Sky Hotel
40,"If you are looking for the quality of a Hilton or Hyatt, don't stay here. However, if you are looking for top value in an excellent location, you will be pleased.The rooms are small, but clean and serviceable. The location is about 100 metres east of Ledra Street in the centre of the old city.The included breakfast is not 5 star but had enough to eat if you are not too fussy. If they included some fruit and yogurt they would keep nearly everybody happy.I am not a backpacker or budget traveler and have stayed in luxury hotels around the world, but I would have no hesitation returning to the Sky Hotel. Functional, clean and an excellent location.",Sky Hotel
40,"Re innovated with new beds, carpets, LCD screens in bedrooms and an excellent Libanese restaurant at the ground floor.",Sky Hotel
30,"Clean rooms, needed to ask for heating, the manager would not budge on the high price for a room for the night (60euro in the off season with no breakfast). This is because the Sky Hotel is in a part of town where people rent rooms by the hour, if you know what I mean. One of the TV channels was 24hour porn, confirming our suspicions.Pleasant enough if you find no alternatives.",Sky Hotel
