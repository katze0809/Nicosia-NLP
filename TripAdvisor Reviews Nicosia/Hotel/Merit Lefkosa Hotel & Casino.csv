20,"I stayed 4 nights at this Hotel and it was a mixed feeling about it let me start with the positives first.hotel is the best in northern Cyprus , it is not always what looks good means it is Good. the rooms are clean ther service is excelent the stall is very welcoming and helpful,the breakfast is good but could be be better.the location is good.the back garden is lovely.Now the negatives: The rooms stink of cigarettes very very strong.the hotel has nine floors but only level 5 is none smoking,please make sure you book this floor if you are none smoker or face the chimney ! the whole hotel stinks of Cigarettes big time.even the 5th floor. once the air con is on the smoke comes in. dont bother to eat lunch at the hotel its medicore at Best,dinner is horrible too. how ever if you go down to the Casino you might find the food is excellent. above all its suppose to be 5 * well I leave that to you.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
10,"I must say that as far as customer service goes Merit nicosia is the worst. They have a few tables to sit for coffee and your allowed half an hour. They do not care if you visit everynight, half an hour and then you get toled to leave. So you either stand or leave. They just do not care if you lost thousands or hundreds, do not sit on their table more than 30 minutes. In any case generally customer service is crap. But wait, they love it if your losing and it shows! Highly unprofessional. Might as well have a donation box outside so we dont crowd their horrible place. Bad attitude that is what describes them.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,Merit Lefkoşa is smaller than other merit hotels I think you choose girne merit hotels there is better.This hotel's casino is small and they don't enter if you are student.Merit hotel location is very easy. It is in the city center,Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,"This hotel fits all basic needs. The hotel is clean, especially the rooms. I took a non-smoking room and it was fine. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful. Some sour faces among the ladies but not all of them.It’s a good hotel, I would recommend it to most people (excluding vegans - the menu is pretty heavy on meat or cheese).",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,"Very good hotel, breakfast is amazing and the restaurant staff are very professional. At the reception a very helpful receptionist called Babacan and another man at the concierge helped us where to go and he knew arabic very well.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"We need to talk about the breakfast buffet at this hotel. It is, in a word, incredible. An abundant array of delicious, beautifully-prepared dishes for all tastes and nationalities. I found myself thinking about it all day after my first morning, and couldn't wait to go to sleep to do it all again the next day.The hotel itself is very nice. I wouldn't classify it as five-stars, but it was very well-appointed, including a great, well-equipped gym. What made it more special was the staff, all of whom were very accommodating and friendly (the petite woman who runs the front desk at the spa and gym was my favourite). I had neglected to request a non-smoking room when I booked, so was placed in a smoking room for my first night. But it barely had any smell of cigarettes, so it didn't bother me. Still, they were quick to follow-up the next day and move me to a non-smoking room (which I declined). They also realized that I had accidentally booked myself in as a double, meaning two people instead, as I thought, a large bed...and they were quick to refund me 50 Euros a night to make up the difference. That's good, honest service.All in all, a great place to stay if you're staying in Northern Nicosia (Lefkosa). Easy walking distance to the old walled city, which is certainly worth seeing, and around the block from a cool street filled with bars and restaurants. I recommend it very highly.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,Here for a business trip and generally very good. The outside is a little gaudy but the public areas are good and the room clean and comfortable. Breakfast is excellent and extensive and other food offerings were also good. The leisure facilities were very good with a Haman and other gym pool and spa offerings. The traditional kebab restaurant is heavily promoted and I was therefore irritated that it was allegedly fully booked all the time I was there. I think if I was not on my own this would not have been the case. There was also a private booking in the Haman one evening abs I was therefore told to leave....if I had been told before I got in I would not have been annoyed as it was I left irritated. I hope to come back one day and enjoy ALL the facilities,Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,The hotel is excellent. Very clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. We stayed over Saturday night and the restaurant had a set hot/cold meze meal. Much more than the average person could eat.Hotel has a lovely garden at the back.The location is great for exploring Lefkosia.,Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,"We visited this hotel for one night. Cant say a lot but generally the impression was good.I liked the interior design of hotel,specially of bathroom and the flowers in lobby.The breakfast was good also. There were ladies who makes fresh pastries.But it was little smelling cigarets in corridors",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"We stayed as a family for 5 nights , every thing was just perfect , friendly and helpful staff, with special regards to Mr. Ali the driver as he told us the word in Turkish he was very helpful and available for us all the time . The rooms were spacious , clean and very comfortable , breakfast buffet was rich . Good value for money , i do recommend this hotel .",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

50,"Best hotel in lefkosa cyprus it is beautiful and the hotel room are very spacious and neat, the staff are very friendly they give you a welcoming drink at the reception before checking into your room and it affordable",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"The Hotel is located centrally, has marvellous facilities but parking is an issue. Food is delicious and the hospitality and decor are great. The availability of a world class casino makes it equally attractive.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,Very nice hotel at a good price. The on-site casino is very elegant and fun. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Breakfast is fantastic - one of the best offerings I have seen anywhere in the worldThe only downside is while the WIFI is free it is very slow and there is no option to upgrade. So if keeping in touch with your business is important this may not be the hotel for you.,Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"My husband & I don't usually celebrate valentines day and hadn't really remembered what day it was, so it just happened to be that day that we were looking for somewhere nice to dine as it was our last evening in Nicosia.We came to the Merit in the afternoon to book a table not really knowing what it would be like and we were greeted by a very helpful gentleman who explained there was a set meal for the evening which wasn't in the usual restaurant, he kindly showed us up to floor 9 where we had an amazing view and was advised that what is usually the meeting room would be transformed for the evening of a set menu and live music. Very impressed with the kind service, we booked a table for the evening.Wow! What an amazing evening. The whole place was set out beautifully with hearts all over, balloons and roses everywhere. The set menu included a feast for a king and plenty of wine. We sat on table 27 and our waiter Ahmet was lovely and very helpful. The traditional Turkish live music really made it a special evening.In 10 years, this was the best Valentines evening my husband and I have ever had, thank you to everyone involved with the evening, it really was special.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,"We had got ourselves a last minute reservation in this hotel after a not-so-kind experience through booking online at another hotel in the city; and what a relief that we did so!Merit Lefkosa is a great hotel to stay at; the cleanliness of this moderate sized hotel is implacable at every level especially in the rooms, with dedicated housekeeping staff to show for such a nice smelling, spotless and very clean rooms, lobby and corridors. Rooms are well equipped with all needed facilities especially with a very good speed free WiFi.Breakfast was included in the rate and it was worth every penny. A very large selection of local Cypriot and Turkish hot and cold plates including selection of more than 12 kinds of cheeses, in addition to the omelet and pastry stations, makes the breakfast an enjoyable experience to look for in the coming visits.The location of the hotel is also very appropriate near the active Derabouy Street where all restaurants and shopping stores are within a walking distance from the hotel. In addition, a main bus stop in the city is just beside the hotel's main entrance. Taxi services are also available from a station near the hotel.The only limiting factor here is the non-smiling faces of the staff. It is indeed disappointing that even with their customer serving attitude, almost all staff members seem to have a bad work day here at the hotel everyday! The management should take a serious note in that regard and work to capitalize the other assets the hotel have with improvement in service delivery to hotel's guests. Another drawback would be the high room rates even for this out-of-season time.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,"Stayed here for seven nights whilst on business in the area. My first impression of my room was it was in an older style than expected, with dark furniture etc. However that is the style of the hotel. The bathroom was very functional, with bath and good water pressure for the over bath shower. The air conditioning was very powerful, thank goodness as almost 40 degrees outside. The breakfast buffet choice was very good and hot food dishes changed daily, lots of fruit, cheeses, pastries and breads too!. There was the option to eat inside or outside if you had the time to linger over breakfast . Each evening I ordered from the bar menu and ate outside. The food was good and very inexpensive for a hotel. They also have an ottoman kebab restaurant on the top floor which serves a fixed price dinner menu including drinks including wine etc. That seems to be a very good deal too, but I never had the appetite to try it! Maybe next time ......Room tip book a non smoking room, most rooms allow smoking!",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"I've lived in North Cyprus nearly 25 years and I am usually sceptical of the hotels and restaurants here. They rarely come up to international standards.However, I'm pleased to tell you that the Merit really is a five star experience.The entrance to the hotel for cars is only a small layby but yiu really can just drive up and the car will be parked for you. This is a big thing for me and I really enjoyed thus part of the service. The staff on reception are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, multilingual, and really help you feel at home. The room choice is good and the rooms are well appointed. An Ottoman theme runs through everything in terms of decor. Lots of freebies in the rooms. Much more than I've seen in other 5 stars. Breakfast was a treat. Massive buffet style breakfast. A chef for your individual requests. For example I like eggs in the morning and I had fried eggs cooked to perfection. The breakfast waiters are fast; friendly; efficient and perfect. I used the lobby for a guest and there was a coffee service. There's a lovely garden area too. Coffee was brought with a selection of rich biscuits. I ate at the ottoman restaurant they have too but I'll review thst separately. I did go down to the casino and I've never seen anything like it. Massive. Endless. I thought I was in Vegas. I was visiting somebody and I have no clue what happens in these places. If you are a first-time casino visitor there are plenty of staff to assist.So I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't think any hotel in North Cyprus knew how to do service but I've been proved wrong. For a hotel that makes it's living from casino guests it was wonderful to feel a very valued customer by all the staff. They made no value judgements about me or my guests even though they had to park my shabby Subaru in amongst the Audi and Mercedes! I was made to feel special. So if you need to stay in Lefkosa don't hesitate and book. I couldn't fault them and I'm a very fussy person. I wish I was wealthy enough to stay more frequently.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
20,"Niceish hotel, quiet but not in a great area, a lot of litter on the streets around it - for a five star hotel, it doesn't have proper coffee or tea facilities. But we ended up leaving a day early in a three night visit as the whole place smells of cigarettes - this is from the casino which openly leads into the lobby of the hotel AND comes through the AC vents. To make up for the horrible smell, in the mornings they just seem to spray air freshener and then the whole place, including the rooms, smells like chemical lemons... so I find it very hard to say anything nice about the place because of this - the room service menu is completely unimaginative as well, a lot of room for improvement, but the first thing is finding a way of preventing the cigarette smoke getting into the air conditioning vents.... to be be fair to the hotel, they didn't charge us for leaving early and gave us our second night for free. The lady on reception was completely understanding and had taken our complaint to the GM who sanctioned the refund - so they are aware that this is a problem they just need to fix it!",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
30,"This hotel is great and not so great.Let's start with the good stuff.Staff are lovely, reception lady a bit miserable but hey ho. Everybody else seemed lovely.Food excellent!! Just great.Room was good too, bed a bit hard but clean (had to move rooms as 511 A/C not working). No worries, first world problem easily sorted.The downsideThe whole place smells. It stinks of cigarette smoke, presumably from the massive casino in the basement.The air circulation system needs an overhaul with filters added/fixed.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"Visited for one night. Room was absolutely superb - first class. Had everything you could need. Casino a real bonus. Free drink, food and cigarettes- what more could you want. !!!Facilities include free spa, saunas and well equipped gym. Massages at extra cost.Breakfast was very good and the waiter who served us was superb. My coffee was on the cool side and so he got me another with a big smile and an apology.Not the best if you want to be central but excellent for a short stay.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
10,"I visit This hotel towards the end of July with a friend. Was made to feel very uncomfortable. As we were two females, the female staff there were not approachable. Very sour looks on their faces all the time! Would not hurt to crack a smile ladies!!! Many of the male waiters in the casino were very welcoming but overheard how the managers speak to them sometimes and because I understand the Turkish language was disgusted by how they are spoken too and treated. They never get to keep all their tips. It's never gets distributed fairly, so if you want to tip them, give to them personally so they actually get to keep it. Also I hear they have Ukrainian staff just yes that don't speak either the Turkish or English language which would be good for me. I don't want to have to use sign language to ask for a drink. They guys the casino were very good couldn't fault but just felt bad for them how they got treated which made my stay here very uncomfortable to hear Thai every night we were here. May want to get some new managers !!!!!!!!!! TREAT PEOPLE FAIRLY! We are humans not dogs!!!!!",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,"Have now stayed here for a total of 8 nights over two visits. Really pleasant hotel in the Northern Cyprus part of Nicosia. Check in welcoming and efficient, rooms clean and modern, staff friendly and helpful - all good! Hotel has a number of amenities including swimming pool, fitness centre, spa and a couple of dining options. Breakfast is excellent with omelette station and wide spread of hot and cold items with definite Mediterranean flavour. Also quite a large casino in the basement but if this is not your thing don't worry as it really doesn't impact on the rest of the hotel. Not really a mainstream tourist destination hotel and never feels busy but standard of service remains high. Very attractive rates available.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"There are some nice rooms here. Get a high floor with a balcony. Breakfasts are great. Staff are very friendly and attentive. If you're into casinos, there's a massive one here. Great fitness room and swimming pool. I used this as a workbase and had good working space and wifi in my room. Overall, a good place to stay.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"It's the first time I've stayed in this hotel. It is really good one.The rooms and its bathroom big enough, comfortable and clean.The staff are pretty helpful, smiley. They have typical Turkish service that is very advanced.They have amazing breakfast with huge selection.The only thing, it is little bit expensive, if you compare it with similar hotels.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
40,"I had rather low expectations, as I had been mostly disappointed by Turkish hotel. However, Merit in Nicosia turned out to be a nice surprise. The rooms are spacious, well equipped and very clean. The Wifi works perfectly. The staff provides a five-star service (and expects five-star tips in return). The breakfast buffet offers a wide variety of foods and has a very nice local touch.The hotel is not so close to the historical city center (2 km or 20 minutes to walk) which is the main disadvantage, if you visit Nicosia as a tourist. The windows are not very well insulated, to be prepared to hear the street traffic and the muezzin early in the morning.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

50,"Stayed here for 2 nights when visiting Cyprus, the room was fine, not European 5 star but not far off. The pool was nice and the staff were very accommodating, even letting me check out late afternoon.The casino downstairs is quite nice and it's free food and drink if you're playing which always helps. Only tiny thing that could be improved is the breakfast offering for westerners, as it was quite Turkish focused which wasn't really to my taste when all I want is a bowl of shreddies!",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

The hotel has a fitness, sauna and steam rooms all free to the guests. Merit hosts a massive Vegas style casino where all the drinks and food are free of charge for all the casino players. Great experience in one of the best casinos I have seen in Europe. A must !",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,"The hotel is located very near to the most crowded street of the small town for of nicosia, the room they gave us was part of a suite so it was quite big.the hotel totally is very clean.The staff is helpful as much as they can.The breakfast includes variety of bread,cheese,butter,jam,fruit,hot food,soup,....It was my second time staying in this hotel,after 1.5 year,it hasn't lost its quality at all,so I think if I need a hotel in Nicosia,I'll choose it again.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

50,"I loved the Merit - I paid 95 euros per night and had a beautiful room on the 5th floor, with free wifi throughout the hotel. The room was a good size and the hotel offers a ""pillow bank"" where you can select your favourite type of pillow. The bathroom was lovely with a fab shower - good power and a very big shower head. There was an impressive selection at breakfast, with the option to sit outside in the sunshine. I used the gym which has a good selection of cardio and weights, and the pool looked amazing. My only two small issues were that i changed some euros into Turkish lira one morning but couldn't exchange them back the next day, and when I arrived I was given very little information about the hotel and was given a letter instead to explain the facilities. I was also surprised that they weren't able to offer a transfer (or at least book a taxi) from Larnaca airport on the Greek side. I managed to get a taxi arranged through my colleague, but was surprised the hotel couldn't even book a taxi for me.The location for me was fine - it was a few minutes walk to some pubs and restaurants and as I was on business, i was mainly travelling around in taxis anyway. If you're visiting Lefkosa, try to get to Kyrenia if you have the chance - it's a lovely drive over the mountains and the harbour is worth a visit (even if the traffic is pretty busy at key times of the day!). I will definitely stay at the Merit Lefkosa again.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

30,"The room's size was ok,I had enough space in the room, the hotel is located in the center of the city so it isn't a very quiet place(although my room was on 5th floor which means 7-8th floor of the building) the rooms are clean but I don't know why after being cleaned every day I could see dust every where. The bathroom isn't very easy to be used,it's in way that after a shower everywhere could get wet. I really couldn't understand why during my stay(10 days) 3 times they forgot to put two towels in my room not one! And 3 times the towels they put were not clean and there were brown spots on them. You may expect a five star hotel to have toothbrush,toothpaste,...but there wasn't any of them.The breakfast can't be considered as perfect,especially hot ones,enough variety of cheese(I suggest you to try white cheese,I think it was perfect)Using the gym and swimming pool are free for the hotel guests",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

Rooms are above average size and well equipped, Television, Wireless access, room safe, kettle, tea/coffee (no milk).The breakfast is plentiful and lots of variety to cater for all tastes.Here are the things that made me lower the rating to a 3:The gym doesn't open until 9am! What is the point in having a gym if you cannot get in there before you go out to work as a lot of us like to do.The pool was ice cold! (well certainly when I tried it)The waiters at breakfast have to be continually prompted to bring you juice and a hot drink.The bar is disproportionately expensiveThe business centre has two PC's but only one works with the printerAll in all the stay was good but with a little effort and a shake up this hotel could improve so much.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

Services are fine and staff is helpful. Breakfast is great with a wide choice of food either inside or in the garden.

30,"This hotel is centrally located in Nicosia/Lefkosa on the Turkish-Cypriot side. Easy to cross the border from here if you need to go to the Greek side. Rooms are lovely- spacious, clean, fabulous large bed, bath etc. Staff are the problem- the receptionist was useless- doubt she had any training, couldn't find the booking and shouldn't be on a front desk. Breakfast was catered to the taste of Turkish guests- a 5* hotel should have more options for foreigners and I expected a continental style. The breakfast barman serving coffee was the only smiling face I encountered.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

The rooms are beautifully-appointed with comfortable beds and large bathrooms. The food in the hotel is delicious, both breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet is full of delicious foods--amazing. Unfortunately, no one in the hotel speaks English, and the service is terrible.The first morning I was there I ordered breakfast through room service. Scrambled eggs were on the menu, but what arrived was some kind of bun with a some kind of smoked meat stick. I tried to tell the room service person, and she became very upset because she did not speak English. The hotel refused to give me the conference rate (i was invited to be a plenary speaker at a conference, which was why I was there) unless I got a letter from the organizers stating I was at the conference. When they finally agreed to give me the rate, they cancelled my original reservation, which caused Booking.com to charge me 95 Euros. I asked them to email them and explain what happened and they refused. I never got my money back. Staying at that hotel was one of the most stressful experiences I have had traveling. Restaurant service was unbearably slow, and often the order was wrong. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

40,a hotel with all mod cons and good service in easy walking distance of the old walled city of Nicosia in the northern part of Cyprus. And theres a casino downstairs for good measure. Breakfasts are a voyage of exploration into a range of foods and tastes you won't find in any western focused hotel and local restaurants are cheap and good value. Probabally too hot for comfort in July and august but like GB June in March and april,Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino

Hotel is good, my room 616 was in a good position with a small balcany and a nice view on the city. Breakfast served both inside and in the outdoor area, in the restaurant not big choice but food is good and the view from the restaurant is great. Spa is well equipped, I had a back massage and it was good enough. Only weak point the reception; I asked to have a wake up call at 430 in the morning and they forget, I asked to cancel some Spa treatments and they forget...No hairdress in hotel but they suggested a nice one in close to the hotel, very professional and not expensive.",Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
50,This is a very new hotel (about 2 years old) and part of a chain. It's great and you won't be disappointed whether you go for business or pleasure. It's primarily a business hotel (and a casino venue which gets busy at weekends). There's not much around the hotel altho there are some good cafe type eateries and one good fish restaurant just opened. This part of the city is on the up. It's agood 15 minutes walk to the old part of the city near the green line. One thing to note though this side of the line is not as cheap as you may have expected. Lunch dinner is about 20/25 euros. Beer is 2.5 euros- efes is best. You can pay for most things in Euros.,Merit Lefkosa Hotel & Casino
