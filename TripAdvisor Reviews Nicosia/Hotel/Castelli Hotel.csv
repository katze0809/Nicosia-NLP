30,"Liked: Close to the museum and a walking distance to the shops etc. Clean. Quiet at the rear. Good breakfast. Didn't like: The air-conditioning was noisy - offered another room but smaller so declined, safe not working - offered another that could have been carried away!For the money I thought it was of reasonable value.",Castelli Hotel
20,"Stayed for one night during a business trip, due to lack of rooms in other hotels.The only positive thing is the location, walking distance to Lidras street and the old town.Both receptionists (night - morning) were very kind and helpful.Room needed some basic maintenance or even renovation, it certainly shows it's age. Bathroom was extremely small. Air condition was functional and adjustable.Bed mattress was very soft for my liking.The worst thing was breakfast. Probably the worst breakfast I've encountered in all my travels.. Juice and coffee were terrible, ham and cheese seemed like they were frozen, bread was from a couple of days back, there was a single slice of melon for fruit and not replenished while I was waiting and finally there were ants walking all over the bench and inside the bowl of croissants. Just terrible.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Basic hotel in a central location. Small room, dirty floor, water dripping from the ceiling. Basic breakfast, without variety. Receptionist ok but nothing special. The price is quite high considering the whole service received.",Castelli Hotel
20,"Left my bags around 10.30 am. Got back around 2.30 pm, hot and tired. Room was ready....or was it. No soap, no tea/coffee facilities, no luggage rack. Couldn't find the hair dryer. ""It's in the desk"". Great... the mirror is in the bathroom and the hair dryer is permanently built into the desk. The window is tiny and there's no view.All and all, very diappointing. On the up side, location is ok and the breakfast was good.",Castelli Hotel
50,"The service was very good, very friendly and helpful, they leave you very comfortable. The hotel is well located near the center, The room was very spacious.Excellent cleaning service, well organised.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Prime reason to book this place was the included private parking. Staff was friendly and gave us a better room than booked. Nevertheless the room was a bit run down and the heater very loud. Bathroom has a huge partly transparent window provided for your inconvenience and several essential amenities where missing. Also the shower leaked a lot of water to the floor and waterflow, presure and temperature is very inconsistent.Staff and other guests where quite loud in the morning and also noises from the town make sleeping quite hard.The locations is quite good and everything in the old town is within 20min of walking.Could really use a refurbishment. Prices where very high considering the run down place and breakfast is quite bad.",Castelli Hotel
50,"After a long day driving around we planned to just find a radom hotel to stay the night, and very glad we chose this place. It’s quite and in an amazing location.The young lady on reception couldn’t have been more helpful and despite her warning me our room was a small one we found it lovely and in our opinion not really that small. As it was late she wanted to make sure the room was ready so we left our bag in reception whilst it was checked out. Both my wife and I had a great night sleep and Cam enjoy another lovely day in the capital city. Will come back for sure and hope to book in just before Christmas for some shopping as the location is within walking distance of sightseeing seeing, bars, restaurants, and many places to eat. Thank you",Castelli Hotel
20,It is below 3 star standard. Problem is that is not clean and there is a strange smell in Hotel. Price too high for given quality.Daleko ispod standarda od 3 zvezdice. Nije čisto i svuda u Hotelu se oseća neprijatan miris. Cena je visoka za ponudjeni kvalitet.,Castelli Hotel
30,"Although it needs a renovation a sap, it still provides the basic requirements for a short stay in Nicosia. Clean rooms, nice bed, helpful staff. I would like to see it transformed to a nice boutique hotel some day. Fair price,around 70 euros per night.",Castelli Hotel
50,"The place is excellent and the staff is very kind and helpful..the service was also really good.The location is perfecr because is next downtown,cafes,restaurants so it's pretty beneficial.I really enjoyed my staying there.",Castelli Hotel
20,"My room was clean but others in my party complained they had insects crawling in their room. The decor needs refreshing as it is outdated. The receptionist I dealt with was good: friendly, helpful, polite. All the others just seemed to do the bare minimum they needed to do. I get the feeling this stems from the mico-managing hotel owner: everything has to be done his way or take a hike kind of attitude. The continental breakfast was ok. It was basic but there was a small selection of cereals, breads, and meat. Pleasant.There are better hotels in Nicosia for the same price range.",Castelli Hotel
10,"When you see a message from the management in the elevator like the one attached, you know it’s not looking promising.Guess what, the reviews online are accurate and if some visitors left in an “emotional state” it’s no surprise why. Just a few hints for the management so they can deal with the issues rather than blaming their customers for the bad reviews:* Had to wait 10 minutes at check-in for the receptionist to finish a phone call. Afterwards she told me she was on the phone talking to her manager. Clearly she and her manager have their priorities straight (i.e. not the customer)* Room is in desperate need for refurbishment. Wood panelling on ceiling about to fall down, mattress is bumpy, walls and furniture have stains on them* Staff is not empowered to take any decisions or help customers. If you have a problem you are referred to “the manager” who is never on site* There was a colony of little brown ants having a party overnight in my bathroom and they were all over my toiletries* there is a mini bar in the room. It’s empty* breakfast was very basic and not tasty at all",Castelli Hotel
10,"Insulting behavior of Nicosia Castelli hotel managerI made reservation in this hotel in May 15th 2018. Reservation was for 4 nights since 24th June to 28th June. The evening before arrival I had received e-mail, that my credit card and telephone number are invalid. I has immediately call to the hotel and i has informed the person on duty, that I will really come to the hotel. The receptionists confirm me the validity of my reservation with notice, that this email is automatically produced by hotel computer system.Next day when we come to the hotel lobby the other receptionists said us that the hotel manager Mr. Andros [-] has decided to cancel our reservation. He also inform us, that hotel manager has sent us message which contains this "" Your reservation is cancelled. No rooms available. Good Luck"" Mr. Mr. Andros [-], CyHMA, Castelli Hotel Nicosia 3*.So I wish you GOOD LUCK too for the case you will intend to make reservation in this hotel.Josef Koc,Czech republic",Castelli Hotel
20,"Rooms really need some refurbishment, furniture is way old.Our room smelled of cold cigarette smoked.Elevator almost collapsed, very scary.Breakfast was on a low standard.I would say it's not worth more then EUR 45 a night.",Castelli Hotel
40,"I stayed here three nights for a business trip. Location is great near central bus station, Ledras street and Cyprus museum. Rooms were comfortable but furniture is dated, carpet worn. The faucet in my bathroom could not be positioned where it would not drip, and room and halls were not well cleaned, e.g. hair clumps on carpet. Breakfast buffet was limited but with good variety. The hotel was good budget value for the price.",Castelli Hotel
20,"The hotel is well situated to the centre of old Nicosia, old and in need of renovating. Things look dated and the rooms need painting to cover the marks on the walls, the chipped wood, etc.The room was clean, but when you get a ""superior"" room, you do not expect a connecting door to the next room where you can hear the other people in that room even when they whisper. Unlike other hotels, there was nothing in the room - no tea/coffee making facilities, no water, nothing.WiFi in the room and throughout the hotel worked OK if not very fast.Breakfast was OK, but very standard (typical eggs, beans, bacon, sausages, cereals, etc.), but nothing out of the ordinary or even nice.When got a water from the machine in the hallway it was very warm (temperature outside was over 30C) and had to argue with the receptionist to get a cold bottle of water - ""sorry, not our machine"" is what she said over and over again.The hotel is in located on a VERY busy and noisy road and in front of a fire station and police station so expect to be woken up at 7am when they test their sirens at the fire station and because of the general noise of that street.When got back after midnight the keycards did not work - either of them - so that meant a trip to reception only to be told that as it was after midnight on the day we were leaving, they didn't work - even though we had another 12 hours at the hotel. Receptionist didn't even apologise.The notice in the lift (see photo) was a bit insulting - bad comments and reviews were because of the ""emotional state"" of the guests? No sorry - bad reviews are because of the very average service, the old furniture, average food, argumentative receptionists, etc.Overall, it was just about ""OK"" with nothing special at all. It is not somewhere I'll come back to.For the money I paid, I expected better and could have got better.",Castelli Hotel
50,"- We stayed on Castelli for 3 nights. We have no negative comments. Everything where just fine.- AC was perfect, towels changed daily and breakfast was nice for a 3 star hotel.Free and fast WI-FI for all your devices, what else you ask more.- Very central with is own private parking.Thank you all for a lovely stay.Margaret RM181",Castelli Hotel
10,The hotel run out of towels - sink is broken and elevator about to collapse. Terrible food in the dinning Hall. The AC doesn’t work- when I told the reception they said I don’t need it / while it was 30 degrees outside. Extremely expensive compared to a nice Airbnb that you could get for half the price. Avoid at any cost. Rude staff- no hot water,Castelli Hotel
40,"The downsides first: no hot water, and since the rooms aren't well isolated you have the feeling that you live on the street. The street can be noisy at times.The upsides are friendly staff, good location and decent room standard.",Castelli Hotel
30,"The first room we got was terrible: dirty, dark and noisy with the water tower or machine outside and, even worse, the AC making big noise every 15-30 minutes that you could feel someone knocking your door for the whole night.The second night we changed to executive suite and got a real 3-star room: big, luminous and cleaner even if sound proof can still be improved. The quality and variety of breakfast is relatively poor comparing to other hotels we stayed in Cyprus but the lady in charge of the dining ares was very friendly. Other staffs including housekeepers were rather nice as well.",Castelli Hotel
40,"I almost did not stop here because of the poor reviews, but pressed on because of the rare availability of secure off-street parking within the city centre. I am so glad I stayed here. I can’t understand how people could fault this place! The staff are helpful and friendly, the hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The bed was comfy with very good quality sheets. The shower hot and with good water pressure. This is definitely a hotel that I can heartily recommend, with only two small criticisms: the wifi is a bit slow and the breakfast coffee is disappointing. For a city centre hotel with secure parking, this must be very hard to beat in this price range.",Castelli Hotel
10,"Hotel was fully booked so they put me in a normal room instead of the Executive that I booked, without offering a refund or additional service in return. Still in the Executive the bathroom was very old, dirty and very small. An experience that will not be repeated.",Castelli Hotel
50,"I had been in this Hotel in 2016 and in 2017 , and yes I am going again in 2018 !! you can imagine three times in the same Hotel , We love it here, near the centre , not far from the Turkish Border , but most of all a friendly and cheerful staff . Breakfast is very good . I give the Hotel 10 out of 10 .",Castelli Hotel
20,"I am traveling frequently to Nicosia and for first time I stayed to this hotel. Although I stayed in the so called ""suite"", my experience was not good. Everything is old and not renovated. The personnel was tired and even in the elevator broken parts are not removed. It is obvious that the management of the hotel does not care at all about the quality of the service and the quality of the rooms. Overall not quite clean room , breakfast at the edge of standard. Definitely I would not recommend it. The owners need to understand that such kind of service is not acceptable. Nevertheless, the building had the potentiality to become a great boutique hotel in an excellent location. Then they will have all the right to request and higher room rates.",Castelli Hotel
20,"I stayed here for 3 nights whilst on a business trip to Cyprus. The hotel is centrally located in Nicosia, just a few minutes walk from the main street, but that is about all that can be said to recommend it.I checked in quite late a night due to a delayed flight, along with a couple of other guests. Check in was shambolic, the man on the desk didn't know which rooms to put anyone in and I was just handed the key to another guest's room when she said she preferred to be in a room near her friends!My room was average sized but didn't look like it have been renovated since the 1970's. The carpet was very thin and threadbare in places and was also grubby. The bed was hard and only had a sheet on (no blankets or duvet). It was October and so whilst warm by UK standards wasn't exactly hot! The TV didn't show most of the channels it was supposed to, and the lighting was very poor. The bathroom was terrible - again grubby (disgusting shower head) and with chipped tiles and a badly leaking shower screen.Breakfast was also disappointing. Very limited selection - tinned fruit, no yoghurt on one day, and horrid orange juice. The toaster only toasted on one side (had to have toast as only sliced bread available). Tables were not cleared away very quickly so if was difficult to find a place to sit and glasses and cutlery seemed in short supply.WiFi was free and a reasonable speed but the hotel doesn't offer many other amenities. There is a bar (or sorts) but drink selection is very poor, especially wine, so I wouldn't bother if I were you!I certainly will not use this hotel again on my next visit to Cyprus and would advise others to find somewhere else if possible too.",Castelli Hotel
20,"I’ve stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, booked the executive room.When I came into the room I immediately noticed that it was not very clean. The fridge was empty and switched off. There was not even a single bottle of water in the room.The whole facility is very dated. Breakfast was below average. The hairdryer in my room was probably 30 years old.What I can compliment is the staff which was very friendly.Do not reccomend.",Castelli Hotel
20,"I have stayed at the Castelli several times in the past and found the standards in the hotel to be acceptable. However my recent stay was a very bad experience, The room was far from clean and had a stink of smoke , the shower screen leaked water, the delph was unwashed from the last guest. there was no milk. When this problem was brought to the attention of reception no action was taken The electricity in the room cut out on a regular basis. The toilet flush did nor work properly.It strikes me that standards have dropped off. I had paid extra for and ""Executive Room"" and expected standards to match the description.The hotel is centrally located which was the only real bonus .I won't return",Castelli Hotel
10,"had a room confirmed by manager for wheelchair assessable room, 5 rooms were suggested but did not work. receptionist told me to carry my wife in or let her crawl in? manager apologised and said the wheelchair room will be ready the next day? builder told me it will take at least a week as it was a building site? on their website it states wheelchair toilets and there were none.we were left to sleep in the reception area until moved to another hotel",Castelli Hotel
40,This property is located in the heart of the city but it is secluded from the main commercial and touristic area. Medium size hotel with an average size room and simple breakfast. A nice property for a short transit,Castelli Hotel
40,"Had a one night stay at Castelli on a quick tourist visit to Nicosia. I had a rental car so I needed a place with parking, and not many city centre hotels can claim their own protected parking area. Parking involved parking in front of the barrier and then running in to ask them to lift the barrier (might be better if there was an intercom, but it was easy enough).The Greek check-in guy was funny and friendly and chatty. Check-in was easy and memorable.As for the room. The bed and the bathroom were fine. The TV only had local channels -- no satellite (unless I am mistaken). The main problem (and here it loses a star) is that the air con simply did not work. However there was a big fan in the room which kept it cool enough. Wifi was adequate.Breakfast was simple but fine.The location is great. Only two minutes walk to the main street and five minutes to the ""border"" crossing to the North.I would stay here again! It was great value pricewise for a city centre hotel with parking.",Castelli Hotel
40,A small Hotel with comfortable rooms and pleasant communal areas.The staff where very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was of a good quality and quantity.A most enjoyable stay close to all that Nicosia has to offer.,Castelli Hotel
20,"It is so challenging to find a decent hotel in Nicosia.. coming to a touristic area I am expecting more and certainly Castelli Hotel is not a place where we should have high expectations. I stayed there for 4 days for business and since the first day of my booking i was concerned after reading the reviews. Arriving at the hotel we had two bookings in the same name, however we made it clear that this should change and we filled in all necessary documents when receiving the keys (there is a reason I mentioned that). When i entered the room in the back of the hotel, there was a strange smell, and i do not know if it was because of the cleaning products they are using or because of the old furniture! To be clear, there was an intention to renovate the room, which by the way was huge, but it was unsuccessful since a mix of old and new furniture doesn't make a room look better. The view from the window was terrible in a sense that I was afraid to let the window open for a long time. The bathroom was small and hygiene was poor. The wifi was working perfectly, however if you had a second device you should get another code!!! which was crazy if you consider.The breakfast was ok, nothing special and i found it very annoying that people in breakfast area do not speak greek not even :goodmorning"" also something else which is annoying is that there is no fresh coffee (as wrote already in another review) I do not know why it is so difficult to provide fresh coffee and i should get one from a machine i could find in a train station!!! anyway, basic continental food for breakfast and poor hygiene here as well.In the check out, i received an invoice which wasn't mentioning my name and also 3 days were charged in my name and the last one in my colleague's name (Even if we made clear during check in that both rooms should be charged in different names). As I was traveling for business this was an issue for me, which it was solved after one phone call and an email. Staff was friendly and helpful. Castelli hotel needs to take advantage of the great location and do more for their guest..Honestly, something should be done in Nicosia. When i am paying 70-80 euros/night I expect more.",Castelli Hotel
30,"I stayed at the Castelli hotel for two weeks when I attended a course abroad in Cyprus. The staff were always helpful when needed and the wifi was really fast. The aesthetics of the rooms are quite average, and the sound proofing between rooms are not that great, but if you just need a place to stay for a short while its really not that bad. The morning and evening buffets are really good, its difficult not to over eat, haha. The hotel is also situated very close to the main street and markets and the border to the Turkish side is also just walking distance away. I haven't stayed in other hotels in Cyprus so I can't really compare it with whats around. My opinion is just what I have experienced back home in Namibia and South Africa.Ps. I am not sure if it is just the exchange rate not in my favor, but doing laundry at the hotel is soooo expensive so pack enough clothes or make some sort of plan B ;)",Castelli Hotel
40,"The location is very good for visiting the old city. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room is large and comfortable, with all essential amenities. Breakfast is good.Cleanliness satisfactory. Two minor complaints: air-conditioner not very effective and some of the towels provided were frayed and grey.",Castelli Hotel
30,"We had chosen the Castelli because of its location, being inside the walls of the old city. When we arrived, we were told that although they had our booking, they didn't have a room. They sent us by taxi to another hotel which was outside the old city and a good twenty minute walk away.We were returned to the Castelli the following morning but the room wasn't ready so we left our suitcase and set off exploring the old town.When we finally got our room, we had been given the executive suite which was very nice, clean and spacious. Breakfast was ok but not exceptional. We were offered a complimentary dinner in the evening because of the mix up, which I have to say was very good. Buffet style and three courses.The hotel is in an ideal position for sightseeing and has a car park which in Nicosia is a real plus. It is just a shame that the hotel's organisation lets it down.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Let me start with what's nice about Castelli. First of all, the location. Close to the central Ledra street, yet tucked away around the corner so not noisy and crowded.Staff is nice. Breakfast was pretty good.Rooms were so and so. I don't mind if they're a little scruffy here and there - not everything has to be brand new and modern, sometimes there's a lot more charm in old-fashioned furnishings but in that case you have to make sure everything is squeaky clean. Unfortunately - as many others have mentioned here - that is not the case. There's dust and hair on carpets, in bathrooms, also dubious looking stains on carpets, furnishings, curtains, even lampshades... With a little bit of work this could easily be avoided and this hotel could be a much better place.",Castelli Hotel
20,"Finding a good hotel in Nicosia is a challenge, and my Castelli experience confirmed it. The room size was fine but the attempt at renovating it ended with the laminated floor. The small bathroom showed it's old age and the view from my room was awful. The furniture in it was a mix of old and new, but not a tasteful result.For €80/night one can get a great room in Dubai, so massive investments must be made in Nicosia's hospitality industry.",Castelli Hotel
40,"At the old Town of Nicosia, you can find a nice hotel; the Castelli.A clean, friendly and warm place, with spacey rooms, ideal for those who want to be in the heart of the city.You have access to Lidras street, the old fortress walls, the new city and the historical center.Disadvantages; for the hotel itself, none. But, although the place ia quite quiet, the muslim priest may be heard from the turkish side of the city, since the hotel is located a few meters from the ""Green Line"" that seperates the greek-cypriot from the turk-cypriot side.Great choice.",Castelli Hotel
20,"Just back from 2 days in Nicosia/Lefkosia in Cyprus. Chose Castelli hotel because it was within walking distance to Ledra, the street wth all the shops and restaurants and ultimately meets the border to the Turkish side of Cyprus. Location was very good, 10 min walk away, area very active and safe. Free parking outside hotel.Staff at hotel were pleasant and helpful but our room was awful. It hadn't been vacuumed properly, found a clump of black hair on the carpet, we're both gray- so obviously not vacuumed well. Tub in bathroom had mould near faucet and around the edge of the glass door in tub - unacceptable when mould on glass can be dealt with so easily. Mound in grout on shower tiles as well! Every time I went into the bathroom I started to sneeze.Room is very tight, hard to get around bed, maybe 16"" between bed and wall. Weird floor. Felt like someone dug/drilled a 6"" groove down the middle to put in pipes or wires and never leveled the groove with the rest of the room, just covered it all with carpet. Thus walking on it was off kilter and felt odd. Same in section near elevator- all this on the 3rd floor.Breakfast buffet was good, but based on our room and state of flooring and bathroom, I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Two star rating is for location and staff only.",Castelli Hotel
30,"I hate to complain about this place because their staff indeed was really nice people and even I have a worry about leaving the hotel to go to another hotel after the very first night (of 3 nights booking). But it is what it is... I was not happy about the very first experience I got once I entered the room. It was not in the quality that they display on booking dot com website. It was not tidy, the bed had wrinkles, towels were old and brownish with stains, the washrooms had not been cleaned properly. Even the heater was not working. So I contacted the reception and by the midnight they offered me another room since it was too cold without the heater. I had to walk down and get the new key and transfer all of my stuff to the new room. It was a bigger one with a working heater... but again the cleanliness was the same! I think that was pretty normal to them, maybe because it was kind of a place where you get what you pay for. My company travel agent had booked this place maybe because it was cheap. But it isn't a good environment for a business visit especially when you have lot more stuff to focus! They didn't have irons, so I was asked to send my cloth to some external laundry, but I didn't have that much time left. I wouldn't say that this a bad place... because they have a good staff. I only would say that this is not a place where you should go when you have many other things to focus on because you might waste a significant amount of time resolving other issues such as no iron, dirty towels, no heater and no bed duvet etc. I didn't rate this place as 'poor' or 'terrible' because they have such a nice staff. I would suggest the hotel management to even that it would be fine to increase the price if they could increase the quality and cleanliness! Because they have a pretty good location and infrastructure which definitely require some renovation (doors etc) and good interior detailing and attention to detail (to make it a cleaner place). With some little more attention they can go for a higher rating for sure!",Castelli Hotel

You couldn't hear any noise outside the room. The hotel has a free parking and a high speed internet connection!! The receptionists were all very polite and helpful. The breakfast was fair for a 3 star hotel. Generally it was a nice stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the center of Nicosia - the main bus station is 3 min walking.",Castelli Hotel
10,"I was fortunate I didn't book this hotel myself (so, I didn't have to pay for my stay); I was brought here by a company that booked/paid it for me.It's the worst experience I've ever had. I should have known better, when I called to confirm my stay and spoke to the Hotel Director. She had a bit of a difficulty to find the name of the booking, but ended up laughing at my worries of whether the booking was valid or not.Nevertheless, I didn't pay much attention. I came yesterday and when I went up to the room, I found a room filthy at all levels (pictures uploaded for all below observations):1) the floors were sticky,2) there was dust everywhere on the furniture,3) the TV cable was hanging from the wall (its not only a matter of aesthetics, believe me!),5) there was rust on various spots on the W.C.,6) the toilet's flush was kind of broken,7) the ceiling was broken - missing a spot that you could not only see the cables on top of it but also listen to the next room's tenant!8) thd sheet had cigarette burns!9) BUT worst of all, the toilet and the towels were dirty, with yellow spots underneath the washes the towel has undergone... and I know this because such towels I dont even use at home for mopping the floor or as a toilet mat!!! They were torn, overwashed and overused and dirty....9) As if all above wasn't enough, I called the reception to provide me with new ones. After 20 minutes a woman came with 2 bath towels saying that they dont have any facial towels and asked me to give her back all of which I had. When I didnt give her back my bath towel, but only the facial ones, she said: ""Oh ok, then I'll give u just one, you don't need 2!"".I was practically ready to scream at her about this and all the other stuff, but I tried to think calmly understanding that there was no point. The premises do not reflect to Cyprus hospitality nor to 2016's hotel standards.If I was a Hygiene Inspector I would have locked the placed down immediately. I really do not understand why booking has rated it with 6.9!!!",Castelli Hotel
50,"The Location of the Hotel is just perfect, just few minutes from the main Shopping Street. Personel very friendly and helpful with all your requests.

10,I stayed in this hotel if u can call it that in September.After seeing the website I saw it looked very nice.But staying there I walked in to the Moody receptionist who was annoyed as his shift change was late.The new receptionist was plesent. I went to my room and the carpet was old dirty and tatty the bathroom was full of mould and the sink had a yellow stain on it. There was a long hair in the bath and the as u can see from pictures the shampoo holders were rusted. I went to complain at reception where I met a prostitute booking a room for two hours for the next night!!!! I told the reception about the room and she said that all hotels are like this. As i have worked in the 5star hotel industry for many years i told her she was mad and she said she would change my room if she could no supprise never happened.Conclusion never will I stay here again and will not recommend to anyone pay the extra and stay somewhere else. Also no balcony cracked doors and dirty towels. Rant over,Castelli Hotel

30,"We were only for one night stay at this hotel. The room was ready for us at 4 in the afternoon!! It was a large room facing to nowhere! From the one window we were looking to big tubes and machine!.. The bed was large and comfortable. Small bathroom with very ""old"" towels. Clean room and free WiFi. Flat tv but no good reception. The air-condition doesn't works at all. Only made noise and no cold air!! It was a very warm day at Nicosia, so we open the window to take a breath!! We asked reception about the air-condition, they went to our room to see it, but nothing else. We had all night the window open. Breakfast was average and we talk to waiter to fill the buffet plates because there were empty as well as the hot water for tea. She serves almost all the buffet plates and bring hot water.All staff were very polite and make efforts to serve us as better as they could.Location of hotel is fine. There is a small parking place in front of the hotel.",Castelli Hotel
40,"This hotel is a little old fashioned with good rooms, good beds and shower.Clean rooms, free wifi and a breakfast with a good selection; although more English style.Free parking, but with limited space!Convenient situated within the city walls its on walking distance from Ledrastreet.Good hotel for a short stay.",Castelli Hotel
10,"We upgraded to a suite and because of the price our expectations were not high. Two little chairs and a small table in a dark corner doesn't make a room a suite. Told there was free parking which would have been great had there been anywhere to park. The car ended up on the street round the corner outside the fire station.Very dark unloved hotel with front desk guy totally uninterested.Air conditioning doesn't work and the 'suite' was like an oven. Got fobbed off royally by said front desk staff member. Promised he would have a free standing fan sent up. When we got back late evening, still no fan. Female front desk manager was most helpful. But. First fan didn't work. Neither did the second one. She was most apologetic but could do no more. It was about 28 degrees in the room so we sweated all night.Breakfast is included but we are giving that a miss. Only thing in this hotels favour is location. Won't stay here again.Tea facilities available but there's no plug socket for the kettle. TV reception rubbish.",Castelli Hotel
30,"I stayed for two nights during a business trip - I had originally planned to stay in The Classic Hotel across the road but this was fully booked. I had a standard room and, although the room was spacious with a large double bed, the furnishings were extremely dated and in need of refurbishment (poor quality tv, mould in/around bathroom fittings, threadbare towels). The colleague I travelled with encountered the same in her Executive Room so I think this may be the case in other parts of the hotel as well. That said, the room was relatively cheap and the staff were very friendly. I only ate breakfast at the hotel but there was a good choice of hot/cold options available in the restaurant. In all honesty, if I were staying longer than two nights I would look for another place to stay, but if you're on a budget and a short break in or around Nicosia then The Castelli will meet your needs.",Castelli Hotel
20,"My stay was from 29th to 30th december, 2015. Bedrooms and furnitures are very old, not preserved, and with no modernity. Curtain was dirty and dusty. The lift was very old and scary. But the bed, breakfast, wifi and drinks´ machine were ok. The receptionist was helpful. Hotel is near the touristic attractions in Nicosia. You can see the uptown from the room´s veranda. Hotel placed in a safe and silencious area.",Castelli Hotel
30,"I visited the hotel with my girlfriend.The room was clean, perfect location, the staff was also level..but very soon we understood we have serious problem -the room next to us (280) was bordello!!We understood that immediatelu-3 times for 1 day some men wrong knock to our door to offer my girlfriend about sex for money!!!It was horrible,outrageus.Of course,we changed the hotel.I can not understand how in 21 senturu this these thinges can happen and no body check who come and why they come!!!That is really dangerous and we will notice the police!!!Sorry guys from CASTELLI but that is the ugly true!!!",Castelli Hotel
30,"This is a budget hotel and you get what you pay for - perhaps a bit more than you pay for to be fair. Rooms were a bite dated - old TV, dim lighting, old bathroom. That said, everything worked and the bed was comfy - although it could have done with a few more pillows, but was on my own so could monopolise the two that were on the bed. The reception service was polite and efficient and there was a nice lady in the restaurant - which had a floor that smelt quite comfortingly of a mild bleach smell - it was really clean - and freshly cooked and very decent breakfast food. Nothing supersonic, but it was a rally good price, so overall good value solid city centre accommodation. If you are on a tight budget then very fair option.",Castelli Hotel
30,The breakfast was quite good.I was waiting better room.The photos from the rooms in the site are from another rooms.We stayed two nights and they did not change at all linens and towels. There was good temperature in the room.,Castelli Hotel
40,"We stayed here for 1 night so we could see the major sights of the Cypriot and Turkish sides of Nicosia without being rushed. It was a very good choice. Check-in was easy, the room was large, clean and well furnished, and the location was just a 5 minute walk from the main shopping/restaurant street. Very nice!",Castelli Hotel
40,"We stayed at this hotel for one night last week whilst on an overnight visit to Nicosia. I have to say that some of the previous reviews on here do not match with our experience. Perhaps we were lucky but based on our experience I thought there were many positives:- central location- the staff we met - receptionists, night porter and breakfast waitress - were all very friendly and spoke good English- a quiet, clean room on the third floor with good soundproofing which blocked out most of the noise of the city- comfortable bed- effective air conditioning- good bathroom with powerful shower and plenty of hot water- excellent wifi which we didn't have to pay for- reasonable choice of hot and cold food on the breakfast buffet, even at 9.00 when we went for breakfastI would agree that the hotel would benefit from a refreshed décor and some of the public areas do look a bit tired. On a minor point, the TV in our room - although modern and flat screen - had very few channels. The only English language channel was Bloomberg Business which quickly became boring to watch. The other channels were 3 local ones in Greek and Aljazeera in Arabic.However, overall I thought that for the amount we paid (about £50 sterling), the hotel offered excellent value for one night's stay in a central location and I would certainly consider staying there again if we were in Nicosia for another overnight visit.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Its a small hotel almost in the city center with a very good location which I found most important for this hotel. Everything is close to this hotel: bus station, taxi station, city center and pedestrian zone with lot of restaurants, coffe houses, shops etc. If you do not expect a lot from hotel rooms, than reccomanded indeed.",Castelli Hotel
20,"There's no doubt that a few year's ago this hotel was a reasonable, mid-range hotel. Sadly like the Nicosia Holiday Inn, owned by the same company, it has hit hard times.The hotel is clean and the rooms functional, but there is an air of malaise and melancholy over the place. The restaurant has long since closed, as has the bar and the coffee bar. Only a very indifferent breakfast is served, matched by the indifference of the staff.It is reasonably located for the old city, but there are better places that offer better value. I suggest that you find them.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Booked here at short notice for a overnight stay to Nicosia, the hotel itself needs a little TLC as the rooms ourselves and friends were put in were in need of updating especially the tv which was something from the 1980's, the beds were comfortable enough and the breakfast was adaqate, the young man at the front desk was very helpful on both arrival and departure which lifted my original score of two stars to three.This hotel is adaquate if one is staying for a short stay in Nicosia if planning on staying longer I would look for somewhere else.",Castelli Hotel
40,"This hotel is centrally located. Although it's next to a small street with sex shops it's was quiet at night and the area seems to be safe. The room size was okay for a short trip when you don't have lots of lugguage. The room was clean and had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and the air con is really quiet. Usually you have to pay for the Wifi, but we were offered the connection for one device for free.The breakfast could have been better and offer more choice. All in all, our stay was good considering the price we paid.",Castelli Hotel
40,"We just happened to walk past this hotel and thought we ask if they had a room. We had a large room on level one with a balcony which was very reasonably priced. Thought the breakfast selection was also very good, lots to choose from and attentive service. Staff were friendly and when we had a problem with the safe, he promised to sort it out, which he did. Beds are comfortable and the rooms clean. TVs could do with updating as they're not flat screens. Hotel is in the city walls and very convenient for exploring the old town.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Great location -- next to bus station and Walled City as well as crossover to Northen Zone. Quite friendly and helpful staff. Really fair morning buffet, but longer sleepers may get only remains. WiFi available in all areas but selectively free, depending on your way of booking. I have booked over travel agency and had to pay. Some rooms might be quite noisy due to traffic. Interiors are really tired, like the door of my room did not close corretly or fridge got rusty. Yes, loo paper seems to be part of saving policies in this hotel. And, be warned, to print out your boarding pass you are dispatched to neighbouring hotel.",Castelli Hotel
30,This hotel was cheap at <60 per night (we just stayed for one night). The room was small and had very few lights installed. The bed was ok. The cleanliness was average and the same for the breakfast. Also there is a very small parking nearby which was full so we had to park somewhat far. The location of the hotel is central but not the safest in Nicosia during the night. The personnel was polite. Go there if you are budget-conscious and looking for somewhere to sleep in Nicosia.,Castelli Hotel
30,"I recently stayed at the Castelli Hotel in Nicosia as my usual hotel was fully booked. The staff are lovely but the Hotel needs work. 1. The heating system just doesn't work. It blows out cold air. We complained but nothing was done about it. 2. They cleaned room daily but did not replace loo paper. We asked on three executive days for loo paper that was really embarrassing. 3. They need fobs for the parking barrier as you need to park go inside ask reception to lift up barrier then go out and park. The parking its self is dirty and full of rubbish. 4. They charge for wifi where everywhere else in Cyprus including hotels, cafes and bars its free. Will not be rushing back.....",Castelli Hotel
30,"No doubt Castelli wins from the excellent location in the very central Nicosia, close to Ledra and the bus station. The hotel soon needs some refreshment, both in the rooms/toilet and the remaining interior. Breakfast is very modest, and wireless internet is very unstable and slow.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Nice location, near the old part of city, average breakfast, average but clean rooms, in general for less than 80 euros per night it is quit acceptable for a hotel in Nicosia, were the average price is significant higher comparing to other european capitals. The rooms in the main road are extremelly noisy, especially early in the morning.",Castelli Hotel
50,"Perfect locations, the hotel is in oldtown, just walking distance ( 3 min ) is the bus station and 5 min shops, bars, restaurant , Turkish border. Room 284 was spacious and clean, the staff very friendly, the breakfast gives very hearty meals. Wifi in rooms, but f your package is not includes free, the fee is 6 EUR / day ( 24 hrs). I am obdurate, but to tell the truth I felt great myself there , it was really good choice.",Castelli Hotel
20,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at Castelli hotel. We have choosen this hotel cause we couldnt find a room at Classic hotel next door, cause of free parking space and executive room looked good on site photos.Good things about this hotel:-Fast check in-out.-Friendly, smiley staff (at reception, at breakfast)-Good location (you can walk in old town Nicosia)-Free secure parking space next to the hotel-Good pillows and matress- Clean room when checked in-Great breakfast for 3* hotel (for hot: crepes, mushrooms, eggs boiled and fried, halloumi grilled, beans, sausages, bacon, and cold: turkey, cheese, yogurt, tomatoes, cucumber, fruits, cereals, cakes, flakes) Coffe from mashine but good and selection of tea).-Nice renovated breakfast areaThings that need improvement as soon as possible!!!:-The hotel has a smell of mold as soon as you enter the reception.-I think we had the worst room in entire hotel eventhough booked executive room for more space and balcony as stated we were give the worst executive room at hotel! On the back with no balcony, dark, only one small window and view of the next building terrace and airconditions. We didnt want to make a fuss and ask for another room.-The room smelled mold very strong and had to leave the window open night and day.- Dirty with stains room chairs.- No ventilator or window in bathroom. Bad smell in there too!- Dirty carpet in common areas.- Noise from outside ( as said we had view of the next building's terrace and a/c that worked night/day).- Towels were grey, torn and didnt smell fresh and clean.- Sheets werent changed at all during our 3 night stay.- Cleaning lady just takes garbage out, changes towels and makes the bed. Didnt vaccum or cleaned, didnt take dirty glasses and bring clean ones.- Noise from other guests banging doors.In conclusion, the hotel needs major improvement in rooms and maintenance (towels, furniture, bad smell in hotel and room).",Castelli Hotel

20,"We usually use Holiday Inn hotel for the accommodation of our guests from abroad. This time the Holiday Inn was fully booked so they suggested to us their 3* hotel (which belongs to the same people) 30m away. It was the first and the last time we use this hotel. On of our guests stayed in room number 382 and the next morning he was complaining to me that the A/C was not working sufficiently so I told the receptionist to fix it or change the room for our guest. He promised he will make sure that the A/C will be fixed since there was no extra room. The next morning the same story was repeated. Our guest in room number 382 stayed awake all the night since it was very hot and A/C was not working properly. Again I told the same guy to fix the problem or change the room. He did nothing and the next day the story was repeated and so on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At least if it is summer, I suggest not to risk it. In winter, maybe the things are better, however I don't know. But what is very bad is the lack of response from the receptionist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Castelli Hotel
20,The location is perfect. Close to everything. Reception rude. Rooms dusty. Bathrooms old. Definitely needs restoration. Just an old hotel from the early 90s and NOT in a fair price for just that. Forget your business meetings. There is no room for that and the lobby is small.,Castelli Hotel

40,"We arrived around noon and our executive room was ready. Reception was nice and courteous. Somehow our request for a twin room was misinterpreted as a room with an extra bed, so the prepared us a double room with an extra made sofa bed. We took the sheets off the sofa bed and folded it back so we could use as a couch to sit on. The double bed was wide enough, so no problem there. The hotel has its own parking lot in front. The room was spacious and furnished with the said couch and two arm chairs, a desk and a cabinet holding the fridge, but no minibar. The furnishings were a bit outdated, the couch looked and felt a bit tired.The bathroom was very small and dificult to get in an out of. We had a room at the back, with no view to speak of. The room was quiet and we slept very well.Breakfast was ok. Both hot and cold items, quality was basic. Staff at breakfast was friendly and efficient. There is no bar of café, but drinks can be had at the Holiday Inn around the corner under the same ownership.",Castelli Hotel

Breakfast was good, with yogurt, bacon, eggs, coffee. Staff helpful but for the one who directed us to Zoo, a dance club close by. He gave us wrong information but we found a techno club and had fun anyway. Room was fine but bring your own dryer, soap, shampoo. It's a basic hotel in a terrific location.",Castelli Hotel

20,"I found myself in Cyprus, with some friends for a wedding, from 19-24th of September. The couple to be married, had the courtesy to book and pay for us the accomodation during the wedding weekend. (We really appreciated that! Thank you Anna and Konstantinos!)Unfortunately, the hotel didn't meet anybody's standards.The room was not at all a three star hotel room.The carpet in ours was really dirty, the room itself was full of dust and had only one window, that barely let some light in. Our bathroom was not once cleaned, during our 5 days stay there. Just changing the towels.There was only one old lady trying to clean the whole hotel and she only had two hands I guess.Our friends' rooms were in worst condition than ours. They found ants on their pillows and trimmed nails on the bathroom floor, as soon as they checked in. They asked immediately to change room and got another on the 3rd floor.We on the other hand, were not in luck and when we asked to change room they told us that it was almost impossible because it was Sunday and had only one housekeeper and wasn't easy to clean all the rooms on time. Like I said, just two hands!The fridge in another girl's room was upside down and all the fridges had black mold on their shelves... How nice!And of course, not once they vacuumed!The breakfast was just ok. It was served from 6.30 till 10.00 (not bad at all), but nothing much. Usually by 9.30 most of the food was gone, but you could ask for anything you needed from the dinning personel.Also one night we asked the reception for a painkiller and they responded that the hotel didn't has a pharmacy and that we sould try our luck at the nearby convenience store (periptero).On the positives are that we could use the Gym and Swimming pool from the nearby hotel Holiday inn.To be fare, the personnel really did the best they could. They were all polite and always trying to help. But what can you do if the manager don't care to have a clean, organised hotel that meets the standards of a three star hotel.I mean, nobody asked for luxury. Just a clean, honest, money to value hotel room.",Castelli Hotel
30,"We stayed here for 2 nights in June Firstly I have to say the receptionist was very helpful we had booked a superior room with a balcony and were given a nice room but with a small window looking at walls? We went back to reception and informed them that we had booked for a balcony room and fair enough she found us one with no problem, No kettle again in room and the prices to get coffee etc brought to your room were astronomical luckily I always take a travel kettle with me and the wherewithal to make a cuppa. The hotel was spotlessly clean and most of the staff very friendly we tried to book a table at the Polynesian Restaurant in the hotel (this was advertised in the hotel bumph in the room) just to be waived away and told No No Not doing it Not Open???? Why advertise it then.. The room we were given was opposite the fire and police station but please do not let this put you off as we heard nothing when the windows/doors were closed and even when sat on the balcony there was not really any disruption at all they kept the sirens/bells to the absolute minimum and after all they have an important job to doBreakfast was however faultless very good help yourself and staff pleasant. My opinion is good hotel for business customers not so great for holiday makers really no downstairs space & no garden/patio area to sit in",Castelli Hotel

20,"I stayed in Castelli hotel for one night and I am really disappointed for this choice. It is an old-fashioned hotel badly renovated and with the basic equipment and for sure not a 3 stars hotel. Unfortunately I got a room in the second floor of the backside of the building. The room was smelling tobacco and the carpets were dirty. There was not enough lighting but the worst of all it was that the room has only a small window which when I opened it there was there the wall of the next building only 50 cm away!!! (a room with no light and no fresh air available). In addition there was noise from the city streets, all the night, since the window was not closing well. I can not imagine how this hotel got an official approval for these type of rooms.The only good point was the location (is near the city center) and that the room as well as the bathroom was spacious. In addition the breakfast was good enough just because (the next door) Holiday Inn hotel supported it.",Castelli Hotel
50,"Read the reviews and knew that for the price it wasn't going to be The Ritz.

20,"We enjoyed our stay in Nicosia but we were a bit disappointed in the facilities of the hotel. Its position close to Ledra Street is excellent, but you have to walk through a pretty run-down area to get there; not pleasant at night! The staff were all helpful and the breakfast waitress was particularly friendly. The breakfast buffet was good and the coffee, from a machine, was excellent. There is no bar, cafe or restaurant, except for breakfast, and the public areas are tired and uninviting.The beds were comfortable but covered in plastic protector - must be hell in summer. Our room was rather dark and was at street level so it felt a bit public with the curtains open. The bathroom was fine.Overall, we were rather disappointed in the hotel; an enormous contrast to their website!",Castelli Hotel

Distance between the two hotels is app. 200 meters so it's convenient to use the spa, swimming pool, fittness centre and other services of Holiday Inn.Castelli is not fancy but for regular travelling it's sufficient. Rooms are clean and comfortable, breakfast is what you expect from this grade hotel, if not a bit better. City centre is within walking distance. There is a good service of wifi coverage in Castelli, though you have to pay 6€ to use it for 24 hours, though the time does not count from the first login, since it is 24 hours of online time within 7 days.You can smoke in room but not at the lobby.",Castelli Hotel

The buffet included all items to prepare a typical English and/or Continental breakfast.The hotel is located close to the bus station (2 min. walk) and shopping streets and restaurants of central Nicosia (5 min. walk).The pedestrian border crossing to the Turkish part is only a 10-15 min. walk away from the hotel.",Castelli Hotel

Some members of my group complained about noise at night as their rooms over-looked the main-road. I would suggest requesting a room away from the road and one with a balcony.Staff were helpful and breakfast was good. Hotel has no facilities but we were able walk the very short distance round the corner to the Holiday Inn and use their pool and gym for free.Location of the hotel is great only 5 minutes walk from centre of town.

No bar which was disapointing also no where to sit out side although there was a small area out side the door which could have been made good use of.

Busstation nearby but bus service is very poor. No pool or outside seating.All in all a bit of a dungeon and overpriced comparing to nearby hotels. Will never go there again !",Castelli Hotel
40,"I stayed at this hotel during a business trip recently.The staff were helpful and the rooms were very spacious and clean. Another reviewer said he had problems with WiFi but l must admit I didn't have this problem.Facilities were a bit limited as they were renovating the restaurant whilst l was were there so breakfast buffet was split over two rooms- rather inconvenient, as I was alone and I didn't want to leave my bag so had to carry it each time I wanted to get something else from the breakfast buffet. It will be nice though once it is complete.It is also within easy walking distance for the Town centre which was very convenient.The downside was the noise from outside, my room was located at the front of the hotel and the noise was very bad from passing traffic both day and night, worse still the alarm from the fire station across the road and the fire engines once three times in one night, better sound proofing is definately required.Also despite having many lamps l didn't feel any were bright enough to do work easily.I would stay at this hotel again but would insist on not being in a room at the front, don't know if the rooms at the side or back are better though.",Castelli Hotel

30,"I have stayed in this Hotel for about a month during the build up of IKEA Nicosia. The hotel is small but nice and could say cosy. The location is good as you can be in the heart of Lydras street in about 5 minutes walking. The down side is that the rooms are not very well sound proof and my door did not close very safely, it needed maintenance. Also at the top floor were i was the wi-fi was accessible only near the door..... I do not know if all these small issues are fixed now but the overall image is quite good, especially for business needs.",Castelli Hotel
30,"The hotel is o'k, but beware of their internet pricing policy. Upon arrival after asking, I was giving a daily wi-fi code, without telling, that it is not free. For three days before coming to Nicosia we've been staying in another hotel in Larnaca with free wireless. So imagine my suprise when at the checkout I was asked to pay 12,5 EUR (!) per day for the internet! It was another receptionist than the one during arrival, so there was not that much space to argue.Later I checked the the booking.com information and the price for internet was indeed indicated there, but this hotel was booked and chosen by our friends in Cyprus, so I didn't bothered to make any enquiries beforehand.",Castelli Hotel
30,"I recently stayed in the one of the Executive Rooms at the Castelli Hotel, after being advised by the receptionist at the nearby Holiday Inn that the rates were cheaper the rooms were the same. In fact the Castelli Hotel shares some of the Holiday Inn perks (i.e. the pool, spa area and even the room menus are Holiday Inn) as they are owned by the same company. But if the Holiday Inns air conditioning was as weak as the Castelli I am glad we didn't pay the extra - we had it on the whole time we were there and I would say that the morning when we left (just an overnight visit to Nicosia) was just getting down a nice 18-20°. Needless to say our nights sleep was sticky in the 35°+ heat of late July.The staff were lovely and the breakfast was great . Full cooked English and Continental style also. The food menu in the room also looked good. As is normal in Europe, no tea/coffee facilities were available in the room, although there was a coffee bar on the ground floor.The bathroom was clean and well stocked. But it has to be said that the room had a worn look about it, with dusty, shabby, hanging off curtains and the lamps by the bed look like they had coffee spattered all over them. The TV channels only had news in English - but a selection of other Greek channels available.For 100 Euro in the city centre, its OK - if you ask to see the room first then you should make a decision. If you're there to see a bit of Nicosia for a night its not too bad - but I am unsure if I would want to pay this rate for a week with the shabby state of the room itself.",Castelli Hotel
20,"I stayed 3 nights in Castelli as the hotel where I usually stay was full. The location of the hotel is good and this is the only positive thing I can find. The hotel belongs to the Holiday Inn chain, which is located just in the next building.The rooms are too small and even worst they have this terrible moquette. The bath also small, the refrigirator empty (I arrived there after walking few minutes under 43oC and I exopected at least a bottle of water...).The proce fr booking a room is actually low, but when you arrive there yu realize the other costs. For having access to internet you need 12,5 euros per day. But the card is valid from 12.00 until the noon of the next day. If you arrive there at night you pay this amount ad the next noon you need another card of the same value.Even for water you need 1 euro for the small bottle, the double of the proce in the kisk of the near place...The breakfast is typical and is included in the price and the air conditioning so, but so noisy. No, no if you go to Nicosia, especially if you do it for business, chose CENTRUM.",Castelli Hotel
40,"We got SO lost in Nicosia. So we finally found this road with three hotels on it. Picked this one because they had their own parking. Receptionist was pretty unfriendly but we did get upgraded to a pretty nice room - so we´ll let her off. Reception were really unknowledgable about North Nicosia and North Cyprus in general. Didn't even know the area code for a phonecall...... Internet here is really expensive. Something like 6 euros for an hour. Bed was comfy as, view was of nothing. Breakfast was pretty nice, waitress was real friendly. No swimming pool, gutted!!! Close to town and an internet centre nearby that is waaaay cheaper, it´s not a bad place!!!",Castelli Hotel
40,"During our stay in Nicosia, we had to move between two hotels. The Castelli was our home for the last two nights in Cyprus. The staff were really friendly and helpful especially when they let us park our hire car in their car park a day before our stay commenced. Our room was very comfortable and large. Plus breakfast was varied and plentiful. It's in a prime location within the city walls, close to the main shopping streets and laiki yitonia.",Castelli Hotel
30,"Although it seems quite expensive, it's relatively cheap for Nicosia. We chose the Castelli for its location away from the city streets and it was fairly quiet apart from noisy renovation work on the building opposite - but that's not the fault of the hotel management. The staff are lovely and very helpful. The place itself is a bit shabby round the edges but it's certainly adequate for a short stay and we would visit again.",Castelli Hotel
30,"- Rooms appointed okay- Some stains in carpet- Internet broken, would usually cost 12.50 euros/day- Clanking noise (elevator?) can be heard at all hours, could bother light sleepers- Convenient location close to pedestrian zone- Service a bit surly",Castelli Hotel
40,"Great hotel in the heart of Nicosia. Quiet, clean, with comfortable rooms.",Castelli Hotel
30,"A reasonable place to stay, but no more than that. The location is reasonably quiet and convenient. Internet service was both expensive and inadequate: I had to take my laptop over to the sister-hotel, the Holiday Inn down the street. Despite the warm March weather, the central air conditioning was not turned on, leaving no alternative but to open the window to cool down the room. In retrospect, I would have preferred to stay at the Holiday Inn.",Castelli Hotel
40,Nice and quiet hotel in the old town near Eleftherias square.Very large room. Polynesian restaurant.,Castelli Hotel
50,"This was our second visit to the Castelli. When booking, the Receptionist remembered we'd been once before. The hotel is centrally located with FREE parking right beside the hotel. Our room this time was superb, complete with a settee and two easy chairs. There is a very good selection at breakfast, catering for all tastes. The waitress was extremely helpful and attentive. Although not 'The Ritz', the Castelli is good value for money and an excellent base for going into Occupied Cyprus and also to Ledra Street, etc.",Castelli Hotel
40,"These guys were friendly & helpful. The room I had was excellent and very good value, at around £50CY per night. The only drawback was the breakfast which was rank. It's handy for everywhere, including a ten m inute walk to the North, which is worth going to for good cheap food.Another plus is that you can use the facilities at the neighbouring Holiday Inn, whilst paying less than half what it costs to stay there",Castelli Hotel
50,"The Hotel Castelli is the Holiday Inn's sister hotel. In fact, it's located just a stone's throw away from the HI in the old walled city of Nicosia. The area behind the Castelli may feel a bit rundown but it's for a very good reason - it's very close to the UN buffer sone. While that put us off a bit at the beginning, we were in for a very pleasant surprise.Indeed the room we were given was fantastic - anything you would expect out of a 4star hotel. A plentiful American breakfast was included in the price. In addition, the Castelli is right in the heart of city making every attraction, including the beautiful Laiki Yitonia, within walking distance. Accommodation in Nicosia is never cheap, but the Castelli is most certainly the best value you're going to get for your money - and you can still access the facilities of the neighbouring overpriced Holiday Inn.",Castelli Hotel
