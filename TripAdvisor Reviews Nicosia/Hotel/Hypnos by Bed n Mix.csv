50,"We stayed for 5 nights and I can honestly say we had a wonderful stay. The hotel has a very modern and elegant decoration while in all common spaces there is an extremely pleasant scent. The room was spacious, nicely decorated with all amenities we could wish. The bed was as we like it firm and comfortable. The breakfast was splendid too, even though due to Covid-19 policy there was no buffet, we had various options to order from , all of which delicious. Highly recommended.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"This is a lovely, well looked after hotel with a modern interior. It is slightly out of the way from other things, but nothing hiring a car or being prepared to pay for a taxi wouldn't change, and its only a short walk to some shops for snacks, drinks and food if needed. Staff were amazing, and helpful if we had any questions during our stay. The room was refreshed daily, not only with toiletries but also a litre bottle of water which was great as meant we didn't have to buy as much water as normal when we're abroad so saved us money and trips to the shops. The hotel was peaceful and relaxing. Breakfast came with lots of continental choice, although it was the same on offer everyday there was enough there not to have to have the same everyday, they even had a waffle maker and made omelettes and poached eggs to your request. Large bed, turned out to be two singles pushed together but you wouldn't know, extremely comfortable. Air conditioning available in the room, good sized wardrobe, desk, two chairs, cupboards, fridge, proper hairdryer not one of those tiny ones or ones that are like a hand dryer, iron and board and a safe everything you could possibly need during your stay. I stayed for 10 days mostly with my boyfriend but a couple of times he had to work so I stayed alone which was no issue in this hotel. It also had a good sized balcony with seating area. Couldn't fault the hotel, I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone else travelling to Nicosia!",Hypnos by Bed n Mix

50,"This hotel is really nice peaceful. The room is very comfortable, the breakfast was lovely, the decor was warm.It’s kind of far from anything, so a minimum of 30mins walk to the old town or around 6-7 euros by taxi. I had work to do so I didn’t mind just hanging out at the hotel for a day or two, but also, it’s so nice that staying out of the town is worth it.The staff were also very friendly and helpful, so big plus there too.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"Lovely staff, comfortable, great beds attractive design, reasonable price, what more could you want from a city hotel? Maybe location closer to downtown would be the only thing, but it’s only a 6 euro taxi ride",Hypnos by Bed n Mix

50,"This is a brand new 3 star boutique hotel located just under 2kms from Nicosia.As soon as we arrived at the hotel I was pleased of its location, which is off the main road. On entering our superior twin room which was automatically upgraded by the Reservation Manager I felt at home.The contemporary wooden furniture with matching door and furnishings were pleasing to the eyes. The contemporary and clean lines continued on to the bathroom. Double size shower with an optional hand held or a large size rose hanging from the ceiling with high water pressure. The complimentary toiletries ‘Zealots’ are made of natural products. A variety of coffees and herbal teas available around the clock on the top floor where breakfast is served. Your have a choice of cereals, English cooked breakfast, pastries, plain local yogurt and more. Everything cooked freshly onsite.The staff and owner who I had the pleasure of meeting were very professional and helpful throughout our 4 nights stay.On site parking and fast internet is available with your stay. I highly recommend this thoughtfully designed hotel.My congratulations to the owner.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"We spent five days here. What a wonderful hotel! It’s new - just ten months old. It’s small. The modern design is beautiful. There is tremendous attention to detail in every aspect.The rooms are comfortable, beds excellent, work area convenient, a pleasant balcony. The room includes a small refrigerator, a sitting area, excellent lighting, ample electrical outlets and even a plug converter.The reception staff is superb - friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, gladly responding to any requests.Breakfast is very good and free access to fine coffee and tea all day is really nice.The hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood, about 2.5 kms from the Old City. It takes half an hour or so to walk there. We used taxis which were not expensive. Taxi drivers were all familiar with Hypnos and presented no problem getting here. Restaurants and shopping are not in close proximity to the hotel.A super special addition is a smartphone in each room to use while here for local and international calls as well as internet and google maps at no extra charge.A wonderful place to stay. Highly recommended and would gladly return.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"Great choice for Bed & Breakfast Hotel in Lefkosia. Newly built hotel with large enough, modern and clean rooms! Very good breakfast is served in the Roof restaurant with great view. Hotel reception is not available after 23:00 but if you arrive later, accurate instructions are provided and you have no issue to enter your room.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"Best hotel by far! Even better than home. Very clean, cozy, friendly and helpful staff, nice decor, close to amenities, many choices at breakfast. After our stay there we won't search for elsewhere! This is the right place to stay!",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"I’ve just returned from a five day break at this hotel and would highly recommend.Location: Situated in a quiet residential area, the hotel is close to a great Greek bakery and close to the old town as well.Rooms: The rooms are immaculate, very well cleaned on a daily basis with the most comfortable beds and pillows I’ve ever had - and I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels! Excellent toiletries supplied, soft fluffy towels and clean bedding. Aircon and heating (it was chilly so hearing was needed at night!) made the rooms even more comfy.Phone: you get a phone in your room which you can use to make calls anywhere. This is a very clever and useful feature, especially as you can use the internet on it as well.Breakfast: The breakfast is just what you need, simple but with a lot of choice nonetheless. Coffee and tea is served all day. You can also order in from local takeouts in the day and a menu is provided.We booked for 10 people as we were going for a family wedding, and the owners and staff couldn’t do enough for us - not just during the stay but before we even got there.They are wonderful, kind, helpful...just brilliant!They have recently opened the bar on the 4th floor. We made sure to give them as much custom as possible by bringing the whole family (about 50 of us!). The staff didn’t even bat an eyelid at the amount of people turning up so last minute. Drinks were served without a hitch and they were happy to chat to us all. They were very welcoming. The drinks choice is great as well!WiFi is free and not flaky at all.A perfect stay and a perfect hotel. Thanks for making us feel so at home before and during our stay!Very highly recommend!!!!",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"We recently spent over a week staying at this near new hotel in Nicosia. The tone of the hotel is set as you walk in - your senses are aroused by the funky and chic decor and the nice smell that permeates the foyer and stairways. You realize then that this is a stylish place to be staying. By the way, it does have a lift.The stylish tone of the hotel is also complemented at the breakfast dining room - which is on the top floor with a great view of Nicosia and the surrounding mountains. Unlike other hotels which play tacky radio or golden oldies from the 80's, this hotel plays cool timeless jazz (mainly from the 50s and 60s) at an unobtrusive volume. So the tone is set aurally for the guest in that you are in a relaxed atmosphere, which makes it easy to enjoy the varied and well made hot and cold breakfast offerings. Dining room staff were friendly and attentive, and requests made to them were quickly provided.As for our room, it was generous in size ; the bed and pillows very comfortable; and the bathroom was well laid out. The shower-head was large and had great water pressure; and the hot water was instant. Supplied toiletries were high quality and a pleasure to use.The daytime reception staff were extremely accommodating - they helped us with directions to local landmarks and services on numerous occasions.Nearly forget to mention that the hotel also supplies guests with a free cell phone - which you can use on and off premises to not only makes calls, but use services such as Google Maps etc. Calls are free!We will stay here again in the future.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"We came 2 couples for a fun weekend. This hotel is excellent city hotel. New, clean, comfortable. The bed is huge and excellent quality, the amendment s in the room are very good I.The hotel provides you with a free mobile phone with all the apps you need including free local and international calls. This is an amazing service.We had a car so all was easyI highly recommend this hotel",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,This place is absolutely wonderful! Very modern. The bed was huge with lots of pillows. Large room with nice little balcony. Decent size bathroom. Water in the room and several bathroom amenities. Complimentary Coffee and tea always available. Breakfast was surprisingly better than expected with a good amount of Choice. They also provided a smart phone with which you could make free local and international calls and lots of tips of where to eat and visit. Would definitely stay here again !,Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,Amazing hotel and staff! Rooms are spotlessly clean and the whole environment is so relaxing! The staff is excellent and always willing to help! Would undoubtedly recommend to anyone! Nothing negative!,Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"Stayed one night and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff are friendly, the room is well appointed with a very good big super-king sized bed. It was very clean and the bathroom was small but modern and the shower was very powerful. Easy to regulate the hot water which came through quickly both in the evening and next morning.There is a coffee/tea machine on the 4th floor where guests also have their breakfast. There was plenty of choice at breakfast time - cereals, dried apricots, almonds, fruit, cheeses, different breads, jams, marmalades, honey, croissants, cold cuts, tomatoes, cucumber, yoghurt as well as a small selection of hot items...bacon, eggs, potatoes etc. Also halva, cake, juice and coffee from the machine. Tea bags are available and cold and hot water. There's a toaster to use if you want toasted bread but don't use it on top whack. It's powerful and easy to overdo your toast. We were very happy with our breakfasts!The room also contained an A.C. unit, hairdryer, safe and small fridge as well as a wall mounted television. The location isn't central but it was quiet overnight. Very good value - there are cheaper hotels but this is worth the extra few euros - recommended. We'd gladly return.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"As a traditional 50+ traveller we hadn't yet encountered the modern world of travel.You get not only free WiFi, you get a Smartphone with 5G for use in- and outside of the hotel during your stay, which is also your 24/7 access to e.g. services.Besides that, it's a modern style clean and pretty new hotel a little bit outside the city center, but still in 20-30 min walking distance to the old town.Room is equipped with what you need, a fridge is always helpful, the bathroom is a little bit to small and lacks place to pur your things and towels. Balcony was nice to relax and gives a perfect view on the entertaining evening soccer match of the local team nearby.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"We have been here now two times. The hotel is very clean, modern and the people are very friendly. I wish I could find more hotels like this elsewhere.Excellent rooms, good breakfast makes you wonder why you need complicated big hotels. Perfect as a base for business when you are in Nicosia.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
10,I tried to ne in this hotel in October. I made my reservation by the hotel website. I received the confirnation e mail bit unfortunately when I was there the didn't find my reservation. The hotel was full so I was forced to search another hotel. Badly organized!,Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"For the first time in many years that I have been coming to Nicosia, I have finally found a fantastic and nice, clean, modern, and good location hotel.The service is impeccable and truly outstanding.From the moment you arrive, the ease of checking in and locating your room is so easy.The rooms are big spacious and very clean with all modern features throughout. Design features in and outside are pretty brilliant.Breakfast with a view at the top of the building and they have a very good selection to.I would 100% stay here again, I wouldn’t even look at staying at anywhere else.Well done to the team here.And now I can recommend a hotel to friends and family now in Nicosia.The city falls short of any quality city hotels. The city needs to come and look at what they can achieve.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"This is a very modern, high-quality accommodation. The decor oozes nordic minimalistic charm with quality accessories and finished to perfection. The rooms are well apportioned, spotless, with firm beds (my priority), ample reading space, roomy wardrobes, comfortable sitting and top notch wifi connection.Finished off with a free top range 4G phone to make free calls to anywhere. Unfortunately, my phone did not work, though I did not really need it, just wanted to try all the facilities.Our room boasted American style walk-in shower with high pressure dual powerful shower heads. My wife did not want to leave the shower. It was so nice. The only very minor issue I had was the toilet roll holder was behind you when on the stool. A very minor inconvenience. Apart from that, this is excellence personified. The towels are of rich Egyptian cotton, so plush and soft. I love it.Service was excellent. The receptionist was helpful, accommodating with a ready smile.The rooftop breakfast area is a great idea and perfect for socialising. I spent a whole evening there just soaking in the view and enjoying my tea (free all day and night)There is a minor issue with parking, but that is typical of Nicosia as a whole. It is not a parking friendly city.The location is perfect. It is close to the old city and not far from the new. So ideal for business and pleasure. There are eateries of all tastes and dispositions at walking or short driving distances. Ideal for a short or long holiday.I highly recommend Hypnos and I shall be back.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix

40,This new hotel is located in the city .-3 Kanri Street of Nicosia - Cyprus but far from the maddening crowd .Room are neat and tidy. Though the operations Manager Ms.Chrissa is very young she is able to manage the hotel in a very efficient way. Ms Chrissa's and her colleague Ms.Catherine's pleasing manners are some thing to be mentioned. My family enjoyed the stay very much.If you want to go anywhere taxis will be arranged.For site seeing also will be arranged by the hotel.The problem we found is that there is no restaurant service except the breakfast Online ordering of food is possible (the hotel management will help you on this)..,Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"If you will have your own vehicle during your stay, will be visiting friends in the area or have no qualms taking taxis to the city centre, then this hotel is a fantastic option for a visit to Nicosia. The room was spacious with classy furnishings, a highly comfortable bed and a large modern shower. Great Wi-Fi and air conditioning; there was a mini-fridge in the room. Extremely clean. Very kind reception. Tourist maps for all of the key sites are in the lobby. Even in the heat, you are just a few steps away from a Zorbas bakery with all of the Cypriot treats you will need during your stay :) If you’re going to spend a few days site-seeing across the island, consider making this your base before planting yourself elsewhere for a few days on the beach.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
50,"Everything i can think about was perfect, from cleaness to having a mobile phone with u limited national and international calls and 4G that you can take out with u all included in the room is really a nice plus. Wifi ws really fastBreakfast was small but had everything you needed and the person looking after kept refilling everything on the spot, great service.The only downside is not having a baby cott avalible but nothing else.You need a car to get around.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix

Sparkling clean all over, the staff is extremely courteous and the location is quiet with no surrounding noise. King size bed, great linen, fresh smelling towels, efficient a/c, good Wi-Fi, free parking, good breakfast. If I only were to wish for one improvement that would be the coffee, which I wasn't so fond of. Compliments to everyone involved in making my stay enjoyable. Looking forward to visiting again",Hypnos by Bed n Mix

50,"I travel a lot to Cyprus, approx. every 2 months. I normally stay at a friends' house, but this time he decided to hire the room in Airbnb and I had to rent a room for the first time. I was amazed at the whole concept of this unique hotel. Super clean and a breakfast with a view. Super relaxed sleep with the Coco-mat mattresses, perfect to beat my jet lag. I will definitely come back in 2 months time since the owner, Savvas is super-friendly and he even gave me a list of the best Cypriot food restaurants in the Region.",Hypnos by Bed n Mix
