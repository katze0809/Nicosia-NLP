50,"First time visit. Surprisingly good, clean rooms, good breakfast, dinner was wonderful, polite stuff. Location is in the centre of the town makes it ideal to go anywhere. Will visit again in the future",Semeli Hotel
40,"It has all the charm and splendor of a grand old hotel but is in fact only 10 years old. The staff are friendly, helpful, the rooms are well equipped. There is everything from gowns and slippers to shoe horns and shoe polish. Breakfast is a good variety, buffet style. Almost always fully booked, so book well in advance.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Having recently stayed at Semeli Hotel during a business trip I was very pleased with the accommodation choice. The hotel was clean, the room was very comfortable and all in room extras thought of! Every member of staff was accommodating, friendly and professional. The breakfast options were fantastic, I used the restaurant 2 evenings during my stay and the food was beautiful, with such a lot of choice. All in all I am very pleased with my stay here and will definitely book again should I visit Nicosia, I highly recommend.",Semeli Hotel
50,"I stayed at Semeli for 3 nights in January for a business trip. The hotel was perfect; clean rooms, warm and very friendly staff. Breakfast was nice but there was some repetition in lunches and dinner. Highly recommended if you're in Nicosia",Semeli Hotel
50,"I was really happy with everything at the Semeli Hotel. My room (507) had a balcony facing the sun, which meant I could work there while enjoying the afternoon sun. The wifi service is extremely fast and reliable, which is something that's often lacking in many hotels today. I was able to watch online streams of live sports in HD without any glitches or stuttering. Breakfast was a nice wide selection of options with very fresh produce (I recommend the cucumber and local cheese).",Semeli Hotel
40,"There hotel is clean and tidy, there was a family with kids in my floor so it wasn't very quiet, the lunch menu is excellent, breakfast is ok.The staff are very friendly and helpful.The welcome complimentary wine was very much needed after a long travel :)",Semeli Hotel
50,Hotel is close to Landmark hotel in a quiet small road. Room facilities were good and staff was helpfull and kind. Breakfast is fine but nothing special. Its an excellent stay for Nicosia but not very close to old town or center.,Semeli Hotel
40,The hotel provides various sizes conference rooms and we usually go there for meetings.The service to the meetings is very good.After the meeting we decided to have lunch with friends there and liked it very much.The service at the restaurant was excellent and they have a menu with nice choices.,Semeli Hotel
50,We stayed for 3 nights. The room was nice and the hotel staff was friendly. We were able to park our car at the hotel easily. It was an easy 30 minute walk to the old part of the city. We'd be happy to stay here again.,Semeli Hotel
40,"Some reviews are quite incorrect and I can insist on this , being a cypriot from Nicosia myself. For example this hotel is in no way in or near the town centre but next to the ex Hilton in a strictly residential area. I was upgraded to a suite which was fantastic in every way though one of the bath towels was a real shame and was changed immediately... The room and all facilities were excellent, underground parking good for about 10 - 15 cars, and breakfast good enough, though nothing special .",Semeli Hotel
30,"Located in central Nicosia this is a local hotel and perfect for short trips.Breakfast is continental and cooked buffetRooms are simple, clean, shower is hot. Tv is local channels.Has a lounge area and a bar. Service is local speed and local prices.Great for short trips.",Semeli Hotel
50,Don't think much about where to stay when you are in Nicosia. The best place is the Semeli Hotel. An exceptional Hotel in everything. It is a 5 stars hotel. The rooms are clean. Good food from breakfast to dinner. A nice bar where you can enjoy drink with friends. Very convenient place in a nice and quiet area with very friendly staff. You will never feel alone. You must meet the GM; a real gentleman. A family-oriented successful man. He greets everyone with a smile and takes care of every single detail.,Semeli Hotel
40,"I enjoyed staying at the Semeli hotel: the room was large, the bed comfortable, the breakfast buffet better than adequate, and the staff extremely pleasant and helpful. I was not similarly satisfied, however, with the daily room maintenance, which was somewhat sloppy and below the level of the rest of the hotel services. Also on the down side was the noisy air-conditioner, as well as the fact that the air-conditioning could not be turned on if even the small bathroom window was open. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this hotel and will gladly stay here again.",Semeli Hotel
50,"I stayed here for 2 weeks whilst in the city on business. It was a nice clean hotel with very friendly staff. The food in the restaurant was pleasant and at lunchtime there was buffet option for €12. The hotel has a gym which has a decent amount of equipment albeit some of the cardio machines did not work and the sauna was out of order for the entire stay. The rooms were clean and had a balcony. Anyone wishing to cool down for a swim, the nearby Hilton has a pool which non residents can use for €15. The hotel has a very strong Wifi and was very accommodating for things like late check out, laundry, space for business meetings.",Semeli Hotel
40,I have visited the hotel in August 2018 with my wife for a 1 night stay.Hotel is very nice and the rooms are good and clean. Breakfast is very nice with pleanty of options.Lobby is very nice and well decorated. Spacious parking.,Semeli Hotel
30,The hotel is very dated and in need of modernisation. The heat/air conditioning is on a central service so either everyone has heat or everyone has air conditioning. My room was unpleasantly hot. I opened the balcony windows for a while but the noise from the nearby road made it impossible to sleep. When the windows were closed the noise still kept me awake.The breakfast was ok. They served a buffet style dinner for a set price of 12 euros when I was there. It was good value with a decent choice of hot and cold foods. The deserts were disappointing.,Semeli Hotel
40,This was second time I've stayed at this hotel and it was very pleasant again. This hotel has really good location and prices are excellent for comfort which offers. Also breakfast was really good and I would say it's really above standard 3star hotel. I will definitely stay here again.,Semeli Hotel
50,Semeli hotel is located at a privileged location in Nicosia. The quality of service is unmatched with other hotels in the area. Travelers best choice for business and not only. Quiet rooms and access to many amenities.,Semeli Hotel
50,"We had our wedding at Semeli just after Christmas, with a 500 guest reception cocktail and a 240 guest dinner.The communication and service from the hotel staff, from general manager and event manager to waiting staff, was exceptional - we truly felt that the entire hotel was working for us.The food was terrific, with great communication and inputs from the Chef regarding the menu selection.All our guests had a great time, both in the cocktail and the dinner!We would definitely recommend the hotel for a wedding of this size!",Semeli Hotel
40,"Comfortable hotel, a bit old fashion but OK. The main shortcoming is the distance from Nicosia centre or ‘centre’ as this is not a typical city. Walk to the center is possible and fine but the way back is a bit uphill. You will not meet many pedestrian though – people only move with cars even for short distances.",Semeli Hotel
50,"professional attitude, reasonable prices, very responsive service, cleanness, rich and delicious food are few of the many good things we experienced at our stay at the SEMELI hotel. highly recommended.",Semeli Hotel
30,"We stayed at Semeli Hotel for 7 nights.Hotel was OK, nothing great. No idea if there are better in Nicosia or maybe it's the best option. But I expected something better.Room was OK in size. Mattress of bed was very inconvenient and not comfortable, especially for those that suffer from back pain. I had two twin beds in the room which were close to each other, but during the night they separated from each other and in the morning they were no longer near each other. I don't think that should happen.Bathroom was very tiny and I wish there was more space there. I also wish they had a proper shower instead of a bath. Was not convenient to enter and get out from it.When we visited Cyprus it was very hot. The air conditioning in the room wasn't powerful enough to cool the room which wasn't fun at all times.We got complimentary fruits and water when we arrived to the room on first day. I enjoyed the kiwi and preferred to keep the pear for the following day. But it was not there, someone took it when they cleaned the room...For breakfast and dinner we had a buffet. Food was OK but not great and was almost the same each day, which becomes boring when you stay for so many days in same place.There are two elevators, they are too tiny and slow that I preferred to use the stairs instead. But not all guests can afford doing that so it's very important to have better elevators.WiFi in the room and the rest of the hotel was working good and allowed fast connection to the internet. This is important and appreciated.Staff were all very friendly.",Semeli Hotel
50,Perfect base for short business trips to Nicosia. Good rooms with all facilities and small balcony. Nice bar and outside eating area and good food at very reasonable prices. Staff very friendly and helpful.,Semeli Hotel
30,"We spent a full week in the hotel during a group tour. Hotel stuff were quite friendly, tried to help in any way. The food (breakfast & dinner) was basic and good, small buffet of fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, meat, rice & pasta. not too sophisticated but as I said, fresh and tasty.In room free wifi and tea/coffee.The room was clean, but the bathroom was too small and uncomfortable (when I wanted to wipe myself after the shower I had to open the bathroom door). there was a leak, that stuff saw but instead of repairing, they just put more several floor towels every day. I didn't want to change rooms because most of the rooms had slippery bathrooms and we wanted to stay with the shower. Our bed mattress was way too soft, so if you have back problems it may be an issue.If the location is important for you, I would stay elsewhere, the hotel is located in the suburbs, the nearest convenient store is about 10 minute walk away.Overall experience was OK, mostly based on the friendly stuff the good food.",Semeli Hotel
40,This was my first stay in the hotel and from the first minute at reception when I checked in the staff are very friendly and helpful it would be a hotel I would use for both business and holiday trips in the future. I had dinner @ the restaurant and the waiter was extremely friendly and entertaining and the meal was excellent. Would recommend this hotel for a stay in Nicosia,Semeli Hotel
50,"After a not-so-great first night in one of the standard rooms, hotel staff put everything right with a move to a much bigger room for the next two nights. Very comfortable, very clean and efficient, helpful staff. Decent breakfast on offer in the morning although a freshly cooked breakfast will always beat eggs and bacon stewing in a server.Location is excellent.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Stayed there for 4 nights for my sister's wedding.we were approx to 50 people and we felt like at home!The staff was ready to do anything and help in every way to make every thing works at the wedding day. Irini, Paula & Mohanad (hope I spell it right) there is no doubt that the wedding day was so perfect thanks to your help!beside this amazing staff, the rooms are very clean and well equipped.next time, definitely a longer stay!Thank you very much 😊",Semeli Hotel
40,"Stayed for a week in June and the staff without exception were friendly, kind and helpful. The result was exceptional customer service. All slightly let down by the condition of the room and the quality / variety of the food. The room certainly needed 'refreshing' and getting more than one option for vegetarians seems virtually impossible.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Already over three times there, my opinion could be no less solid regarding Semeli Hotel.Located in a perfectly convenient spot, pretty close to the center of the city and at the same time 5 minutes away from the highway and the exit of Nicosia to other destinations.With classic decoration, but still, lots of modern touch combined to total cleanliness, Semeli offers generously a sense of ""well organised"" and relaxation by the moment you step in.Spacious quite rooms, fully equipped (coffee machine, amenities), VERY comfortable anatomic mattresses, everything calculated and made with love and true respect to the customer's needs to the tiniest detail.Breakfast is a full American Buffet with nothing missing. Freshly made food, local specialties, sweet temptations and limitless coffee make the best way to start ones day.Apart from that, the all day function of the restaurant together with the excellent lobby and main bar ""surroundings"" make Semeli Hotel an ideal venue for a descent business meeting.Last but not least the excellent stuff! Highly professionals,great connoisseurs of the art of Hospitality, polite, friendly but also discreet, they all make you feel no less but home!Bravo Semeli team! Highly recommended!",Semeli Hotel
50,"What an amazing place!This is definitely a place where you pay for a 3* but get the services and quality of a 4* hotel.We have chosen this hotel for a 1 night stay but would easily stay longer.High standards in all parts of this business with excellent service.Rooms were really clean with comfortable beds and pillows, a hot tub and a JacuzziLocation is brilliant too as its really close to the town centre",Semeli Hotel
50,This is a very good hotel with excellent staff. It was a great experience to meet the staff who is so much service-minded. The hotel has a good location but still very calm. It's not too big just the right size.,Semeli Hotel
50,"No frills, good location, ideal hotel for business travelers. What makes it stand out is the very friendly and highly professional service. Also great value, with a more than adequate breakfast and good wi-fi throughout.",Semeli Hotel
30,"I stayed here for one night last week, it was absolutely fine and a decent alternative to the Hilton.The staff on reception were friendly and efficient. My room was clean but a bit dated with the WiFi signal being intermittent.The car park is situated very close to the hotel but it’s worth stopping at the hotel to drop heavy bags as the slope is quite steep.Breakfast was decent, with good choice and a nice start to the day. I’ll definitely stay again.",Semeli Hotel
30,"Booked 5th floor double room with fridge, kettle etc and balcony and breakfast -accommodation great with clean room but hard pillows and when asked for feather none available but that is a minor thing. Breakfast absolute minimum and bland fruit salad basically apples, orange and apple juice not fresh although both apples and oranges are in season on the island and therefore really cheap. Other fruit not great quality and no oranges were ever available as fresh juice or to peel. The coffee is self service from a machine and no decaf - you have to pay around 3.50 euro per cup. I asked to speak to the manager several times but he never contacted me. Reception staff otherwise very helpful. Shame no local foods are reflected in the breakfast choice and no communication available in case of a complaint as I felt I needed to make - it is a 3-4 star hotel but felt much less in what I have mentioned above. Pity.",Semeli Hotel
50,One of the best hotels in Nicosia. Located in a quiet area and close to the center. The service staff is pretty welcoming and professional. Rooms are super clean.The overall ambience is great. Rates are affordable and it is real value for money.,Semeli Hotel
40,"Semeli Hotel is located not far from the city centre. You can get there if you like walking in less than 30 mins.There is also a nice, large park close to it, ideal for shorter walks when it gets really hot.The view from the hotel is not that great but it's quiet. Kennedy avenue runs close where you can catch a but to the city center. Unfortunately buses in Cyprus stop early.The rooms are very spacious, squeaky clean, well equipped. They have a mini bar which is always full with drinks and snacks. A small bottle of wine and fruit will be waiting for you upon arrival.The beds are very comfy and the duvets very light but warm.The breakfast was nice and buffet style. The staff very friendly and polite. The lobby is very elegant and comfortable too. You can choose to sit outdoors if you want to smoke. Smoking is not allowed indoors.I do recommend Semeli.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I attended a training in this hotel and stayed for 4 nights. Really nice hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Food is really good, tasty and fresh. Rooms are clean and comfortable, will come back for sure :)",Semeli Hotel
40,"Very clean rooms!Free wifi!Personnel is extraordinary helpful, polite and customer friendly! Well done!Rooms are vey nice with cocomat beds ensuring you enjoy a good sleep.The food for a hotel is really good, worth having dinner",Semeli Hotel
30,"Hotels in Nicosia are by far very expensive for what they offer though the city is cheap compared to other EU destinations. Hotel is not in the centre, right behind the Hilton and a few minutes drive to downtown. Executive room with jacuzzi ,spacious room and nicely furnished with heavy vintage furniture. The most slippery (and dangerous) bath tub I ever had !! Three holes on the wall, as if something had been removed, looked ugly but my request was ignored. Very professional service at Reception, normal breakfast buffet, nothing special, fantastic bar. On Sundays prepare yourselves to wake up to bells banging ever so loudly at the church a few metres away... Very unprofessional was housekeeping in that they never removed any used toiletries, once no floor towel was available, and finally no bath towel was in the room, what they brought to me was anything but a towel, torn apart, threads hanging here and there, this was disgusting, (apparently there is a language problem with housekeeping). I called Reception to see the junk that was brought to me and took some pictures as well...The hotel is very nice, well located, parking available for 15=20 cars, but small things make a hotel great, and myself as a traveler, I was rather disappointed with what I experienced. At more than a 100 euros per day I expected something more. Lastly, not the hotel's fault, but guests banging the doors like hell round the clock.",Semeli Hotel
40,I stayed at the executive room which was nice and spacious. Staff were very nice and breakfast was good.The towels were somehow old and little torn but at the overall I found it as good place and excellent value for money,Semeli Hotel
40,"The best thing this hotel offers is the Jacuzzi in the suite, although the suite is not cheap it is still at an affordable price and below the price you would pay for a Hilton regular room so it definitely worth to take a suite here.We had an issue with room 401 that had a very weird smelling (coming from bathroom) but they accepted to change it and everything was ok in the new room.close to old town and Ledras street (7 euro taxi or about 25 mn walk so really fair)The only minus was no heating system in the bathroom.Also staff at night was less friendly that the one during the day.",Semeli Hotel
30,Stayed for a night only - the rooms are kind of small if you are planning to sit on the desk - but clean and comfortable - so does the bathroom. Heating was a bit too much for my standards - couldn't adjust the control all night... On the other hand the service is excellent - very polite and helpful staff.,Semeli Hotel
40,"I very much like this small hotel and prefer it because it seemed to have a more local flavor. The breakfast is good, and the rooms were quiet and comfortable. As stated, it is a little far from the city center. However, for the price it is great. In addition the staff is extremely nice and the rooms are very comfortable. You will not make a mistake if you stay here.",Semeli Hotel
30,"I stayed for 20 nights in Semeli hotel from November 26th to December 15th, 2017, generally it is an average business hotel.Positive:Friendly staff, specially Eline at the reception.Clean room.Quick laundryNegative:Bathroom was a little rundown.The bed was very narrow.",Semeli Hotel
40,"A small, friendly, comfortable hotel some distance from the centre of town. It's a good 25 minute walk to Ledra Street, museum, art gallery etc but taxis are reasonably priced if you don't feel like walking. Room was very spacious and comfortable, but can't say I'm a fan of the overall brown colour. Makes the place look very dated. Hotel restaurant offers a reasonable selection of meals, but cheese and biscuits as an alternative to dessert can't be done - despite the fact they offer a cheese platter for two! Breakfast selection quite good and available until 10 am - they should say 9.45 as everything is cleared away very quickly when the clock strikes 10.",Semeli Hotel
30,"The breakfast was good. The staff are friendly. And the room was a good size. But for me, the bed was too soft and I woke up with backache. The bathroom was very cramped and the floor ended up soaking wet from the shower.With a more comfortable bed, I would stay again, but today, I am on painkillers for a sore back!!",Semeli Hotel
40,"I stayed for two nights for a conference. Generally everything was great: Rooms were clean, the bed is comfy, the staff is helpful, the food is good. Just the problem was its location, it's far 30 minutes walking to the city center.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Wonderful service, polite and very helpfull staff that makes you feel comfortable, really nice people. Breakfast was tasty and fresh and the room service very good! Nice food. Facilities in my room - fresh fruit, water, cofee. And in the bathroom, too.A place that you feel safe and comfortable - I would recommend it for a businnes accommodation also!",Semeli Hotel
20,"I am rating as below average because during my last visit, we had booked for a suit and we stayed unhappy. Yes the room was big, yes the breakfast was satisfying and the staff friendly BUT we weren't able to use the bath because there was a problem with it and the water from the bathtub kept leaking on all over the bathroom floor. I am sure if i had ignored it and took a bath or used the jacuzzi (it was a jacuzzi-bath) the leak would go all over our room and outside of the suit. Because of the late in the hour that we realized this we didn't request for a change in the room but we notified them the next day and they said they will check it.Since we stayed only for one night we didn't have the chance to see what they would suggest we do (change room etc).Nevertheless after this experience i don't think i would ever take my chance with this hotel again because i highly doubt that the leaking first occurred on our visit since as soon as we opened the water, water started coming to the bathroom floor without any delay. This is not something that the cleaner could ignore during their regular cleanings of the bathtub, the cleaner should have realized that it was heavily leaking and either ignored it or told the responsible person about it but instead of them to arrange for it to be fixed, they just let more people to stay there. Either way it was very disappointing.",Semeli Hotel
30,"Normal hotel, old fashion, noisy the cleaning staff in the morning. Breakfast need to improve. Nice people at the reception. Hotel more for business than leisure. Is about 30 minutes walk from the pedestrian area.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Irene, especially, but all the staff, were more than helpful, kind and very attentive. It is a lovely older hotel, central to Nicosia.My husband and I have been traveling Europe for ten weeks, this hotel provided the best service we have experienced. I would recommend this hotel to everyone!!!!!",Semeli Hotel
40,"My wife and I stayed here for 9 nights in a so called suite on the corner of the 2nd floor. It's really a larger than usual room with a comfortable settee and a bathroom with a spa bath. There was a small but usable balcony with a table and two chairs.Wifi was free. The signal was adequate apart from one day when the signal was intermittent and even when available very poor. Don't know why.The staff at every level were unfailingly helpful and competent.I cannot say the same for the hotel lifts however. They seem to be slow witted. They react to any summons slowly and with an almost human reluctance. When you succeed in waking them from their sleep let's say from the second floor they are likely to bypass your floor, travel to and then return y to your floor. The door will then open lethargically to reveal an empty lift.Meanwhile as you were waiting in the corridor, all the lights went out. This is because electricity in Cyprus is expensive and management has installed motion sensors with time delays. Light can be restored we discovered by running up the corridor and waving one's arms about.Our bedroom lights were energy saving and provided just about adequate illumination if you did not need to read anything with standard sized print too far away from a bulb. Reverting to the bath room we did not use the spa bathe. No doubt somebody would have explained the use of the controls to us had we asked but we have found that coping with anything more complicated than hotel showers may be tempting p5rovidence. The shower was good though. Lots of lovely hot water and as much pressure as you might desire.The menu for room service seems to be pretty much the same as that in the restaurant. Beware the toasted ham and cheese sandwich by the way. The ham is not . Or not ham as we know it, Jim. It smells like something between spam and luncheon meat. The edges were suspiciously sharp too, It has all the hallmarks of a processed meat. Best avoided - unless you like spam or luncheon meat of course.The breakfast bar offers a reasonable selection, It includes fried and scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms and so on in heated containers. They keep the food warm but inevitably the fried eggs in particular are best eaten sooner rather than later. Do not be late for breakfast for the best results.Whatever quibbles we had with the hotel and its mechanical services or the awfulness of the many very large paintings scattered throughout are redeemed by the staff. They are cheerful, helpful and efficient from top to bottom. Now how often do you come across that?",Semeli Hotel
40,"Stayed here on business for a couple of nights, the room was clean, well equipped and of a good size with a little balcony( the plastic table was probably a little too big for the space but didn't bother me). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful from storing luggage after checkout before departure to booking taxis. I was fine with the breakfast although it is not the most extensive of selection, bread, pastries, egga, sausage, bacon, mushroom and a few cold cuts. Prices in the bar were not unrealistic for a city hotel and either sitting inside or on the terrace was very pleasant. The walk to the old town was probably twenty five minutes with a range of places to eat out, plus convenient to get on the road out of town.",Semeli Hotel
50,Have to say I stay here weekly and can never fault the service so felt the need to give it another review. From owner Nikolas through all of the staff the overall service is impeccable. Rooms are so so comfortable with everything you could ever need and nothing is a bother for all staff. If you are in Nicosia I wouldn't hesitate to stay here.,Semeli Hotel
50,"The experience in Semeli Hotel was a perfect symbol for Cyprus visit. The place is friendly with convenient services and extreme hospitality. The rooms are so comfortable, with appropriate facilities and cozy atmosphere. The Staff are uniquely friendly and cooperative. Although the room view was traditional and the restaurants and even room service are not 24/7 yet this is compensated by the perfect services and convenient prices.Visiting Semeli hotel will always remind you that you are in the warm friendly Cyprus.",Semeli Hotel
30,"I stayed on a business trip for 2 weeks at this hotel. The ups first Hotel is located at a convenient place from the city center and Downtown is quite walkable, Rooms were clean and almost all rooms have good balcony space, Bar collection could have been better. The Downs firstly breakfast is so repeated that after having the same for like 3-4 days you don’t feel going for breakfast. Lifts though 2 of them but are too slow so if you did not manage space in the lift at first be ready to wait for 3-4 mins before it again comes back. Since this hotel is like 5-6 years old it lacks maintenance, the AC of my room(504) went off two nights in a row and I was given another room to sleep and only after 2 days my room was changed(202). That’s it now about the staff, Staff is super helpful and stands to your needs as and when required so keep it up Semeli Staff. All in all its a nice place if you are visiting Cyprus for holidays for business traveler going for a week and above you can check for other options as well like Almond suites.",Semeli Hotel
50,"The staff is very kindLuxuries construction the room 204 was in front of the Hotel with enough space !Very nice gym that is remain open until 11 a.m.Breakfast is acceptableThere is extra charge for Cyprus coffee !The complementaries such as shave kit , Dentist kit is complete !Nice hotel !",Semeli Hotel
30,Stayed at this property for 13 NightsStaff (Ms Marry at Reception ) was nice and cooperative.Advice to Management : At least provide one complementary water bottle per night .Wi-Fi connectivity should be improved inside the rooms.,Semeli Hotel
40,"Rooms was big, clean and modetnixed. Food in restaurant for dinner and breakfast was good. A goid hikevto the city centre. Not much closeby although we did find a small corner store and a great restaurant Armenaki about 10 minutes walk. Did not see any good local hotels close to the city centre, so this and the Hilton next foor may be best bets.",Semeli Hotel

The best service ever, they make you feel like your home, that they care for you to have a great and warm experience.... Bravo !",Semeli Hotel
30,"Plusses :Situated in a quiet area. Friendly staff. Quite large rooms.Minuses :Given the quality of food on cyprus, why on earth can they not provide a decent, tasty breakfast? No good bread, sausages without any taste, mushrooms inedible, orange juice that probably has never seen any natural oranges, instant coffee. Towels in the rooms have seen better days.",Semeli Hotel
50,"The hotel is located just 2 km from the old town on the quiet street, near the Central Bank of Cyprus and not far from the University of Cyprus. It is very good for the 3 star hotel. My room was comfortable, clean and well equipped, even with bath robes and all necessary bath accessories. WiFi connection was available in the room. Breakfast was good, only coffee could be better. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I could recommend this hotel for the short business visit to Nicosia.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Great location to the city centre! Very comfortable with a great value-based price! The buffet breakfast is excellent with many choices! Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was great and staff helpful. Quiet room. We would definitely stay again!",Semeli Hotel

Ledra Street is a 25 minute walk away.Hotel receptionists extremely friendly and helpful.Our room was huge with a terrace.Breakfast was great and hot. Best ever toast I've had in a hotel.!!!,Semeli Hotel
40,"This is a clean, professional and quiet hotel off main streets and between the Central Bank and the Hilton Hotel. I have stayed here before and it was nice to return. Staff are unobtrusively efficient and the general atmosphere is good. Rooms are fine, altough the bathrooms are a tad small and baths double up as showers - difficult to get in and out however. Beds were comfortable and the only recommendtion is to make sure balcony door is closed as mosquitos can enetr and be very persistent. I dined here. Food is average and could do with more variety and better fish options. Wine is decidedly overpriced. Breakfast is excellent. General standards of cleanliness are above average. Helpful and efficient staff.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Nice and clean hotel with very kind and helpful staff. I had a problem with taxy driver that was paid through FoxTransfer and who similar didn“t come. Hotel staff was very kind and helpful, try to help me and keeping me feel that everything will be ok. So, I want to say to everyone NOT TO USE FOXTRANSFER.EU EVER!!!! THEY ARE UNRELIABLE!!!!",Semeli Hotel
40,"The hotel offers a pleasant stay with excellent service. Its considered more likely as a classic hotel but it surely serves the purpose for a business trip even though it is not ideally located (but in a quiet neighborhood and quite close to the city center). The rooms with ""heavy"" wooden decoration with nature paintings on the walls and bathroom were nice and clean. Noticed that the bed quality was excellent. Many options for breakfast for everyone's taste and the lunch offered was also really nice and tasty. Rooms are very quiet with a strong free WiFi signal which was really good. We also used the conference/meeting rooms that were well equipped. Only disadvantage noticed was the room's door which was not sound proof at all and in the morning you could hear every noise from the corridor outside.However, would definitely recommend it for a pleasant stay for business or pleasure.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Extremely professional and helpful staff, large rooms with good view, excellent breakfast with large varity. The service from the bar and restaurant staff was very good. The hotel is immaculately clean throughout. Bed comfortable with good quality linen.",Semeli Hotel
50,"We (2 adults and 2 infants) had an excellent stay at this hotel. The place was clean, and the food (breakfast, dinner buffet, room service) was delecious. The staff are very friendly. Overall more business-oriented, but works very well for families.",Semeli Hotel
30,"Nicosia is a great city to visit and the Semeli is a welcoming hotel with an impressive entrance (including a pleasant terrace). The staff were all approachable and helpful. I did however expect more from the rooms given that it's rated 4.5 by travellers. Despite having a suite, I did not find it overly impressive- and the bathroom could definitely do with modernisation. The continental breakfast was satisfactory but nothing to write home about. In summary, I think it's a reliable choice for a good stay in Nicosia but don't expect a high end hotel. Parking is secure underground, and the walk into the Old town is not too far (no more than EUR 7 for a taxi ride either).",Semeli Hotel
50,"This hotel was found out of desperation from having left another poor hotel in the city. This hotel was the epitome of helpful and eased our worries. They gave us the best room available, a complimentary drink while we waited and couldn't do enough for their guests. Clean, spacious and everything you want for a break in Nicosia. Visit there if you get he chance. We will be back having found this gem.",Semeli Hotel
40,"The staff was amazing. The rooms clean, quite and spacious.Due to limited time, I did not have the chance to have breakfast.A little bit away from the center of Nicosia (aroung 2km). Very good value for money. No special common areas.",Semeli Hotel
50,Overall had a really good 3 day stay at the hotel. The food that they provide it is really good and the rooms are nice as well. Highly recomended for its price and its the best deal in Nicosia. Should be a 5 star hotel,Semeli Hotel
50,"The room is big, the furniture is great and the bed is amazing. It's not crowded and the breakfast is also good. The checkin and the checkout is fast and we didn't get any problems to arrive since the place is in the entrance (from Larnaka). The city is amazing and people very friendly.",Semeli Hotel
50,"I had the greatest pleasure along with my wife a couple week back to have a four night stay at the Semeli Hotel in Nicosia. Originally we had only booked one night with a view to choose other hotels around the island in order to get as good a first Cyprus visit. My wife an dI are looking at the possibility of buying a place there. we currently live in Dubai and have for the past 20 odd years.The staff at the Semeli went absolutely out of their way to accommodate us changing the original booking to allowing us to stay for the full four nights and 5 days in the hotel.A special thanks must go to Eirini, who was so very nice to me and my wife and advised us of where to go and how to get there. But equally Isabelle, Mary and Paula (the Manager) were so attentive and assisting to us while there I have no doubt that when we return that is where we are going to stay.It manages to offer the homeliness of a private hotel, with the friendliness and professionalism of a 5 star resort while offering very comfortable rooms and really good food in addition. In my estimation from a traveler's standpoint this is my own idea of a ""5 star hotel"". Greta job to Eirini and the girls. See you next time. Charlie",Semeli Hotel
40,"I have nothing to complain for, the staff was very friendly, the food was tasty and the rooms well equiped and clean! The location was also perfect! We stayed for 3 nights and everything was good! We also held a conference as well as a gala dinner for over 100 people. Both were very well organised and successful!",Semeli Hotel
50,"My wife and I stayed at the Semeli hotel to celebrate our 25 wedding anniversary. The hotel and location was a perfect choice. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room facilities be it bathroom or mini bar are very well equipped. Mini bar prices were also very competitive as was main bar prices. We had a lovely evening dinner in the restaurant and our fillet steaks were very tender and cooked to perfection, recommended. As it was a special anniversary, the hotel kindly paid for all our drinks.All in all, a very comfortable, clean and well looked after Hotel and would have no hesitation in staying again.Graham and Barbara",Semeli Hotel
30,"Stayed here for a week with my job and could write a lot but will focus on the most relevant aspects. There are two main reasons why I rated this beautiful hotel as a 3 and not a 4:1. The lousy wi-fi.2. The bad sleep due to the thin walls.Wi-fi did not work very well in our rooms or in the conference area. It kept losing the connection.VERY thin walls! This means that it is very disturbing when staff and guests talk in the hallway or if a guest is watching TV or having a conversation. Even a small cough will make its way into your sleep. Bring earplugs or count on being woken up by people either out late or up early for breakfast/housekeeping.Other things worth mentioning: Bed is very comfortable and AC worked well. Most of the staff is super nice and helpful, especially Aliona (who is working in the restaurant) and Paola (front office manager). And room service was very quick.Breakfast is OK even for vegetarians/vegans but the hotel had a hard time ordering soy milk. But after a couple of days it finally turned up! :) The hotel also serve lunch and dinner, and have several vegetarian options on the menu.Quiet area, not many restaurants around the hotel apart from their own. Either walk 15-20 minutes or take a taxi to find more options.Conference venue is in the basement which means no windows. They actually moved us between different rooms from one day to another without informing us, which did not feel that great.",Semeli Hotel
50,"stayed in this hotel, due to unfortunate circumstances, All staff were very helpful with all aspects that we needed for example translations, urgent taxi requests & support during a very sad time. Everyone was very professional, the rooms were clean and comfortable and supplies like tea and coffee always available. Central hotel to local general hospital approx 7 euros. Taxi to Nicosia main street 6 euros. Food in hotel very reasonable and off high quality. Thank you, all your kindness and respect for our circumstances will always be remembered.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Spent 3 nights here in June 2016. The staff are professional, the place is clean, the room we stayed in (room 505) was a great corner room with open view.This hotel is not a resort or some kind of luxury hotel, but is basic and does the job for a reasonable price. If you are not used to super luxury hotels this place is just right.",Semeli Hotel
50,"If you wish to have clean, straight forward, with reasonable price hotel then Semeli is the right choice in town.I was very pleased in my stay and I have been in several times earlierThis will be definitely my choice when I am Back to visit Nicosia ones again.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Stayed for a week in August. The reception staff were very efficient, friendly and helpful. The service from the bar and restaurant staff was very good. The hotel is immaculately clean throughout. Bed comfortable with good quality linen. Breakfast was good but was the same for 7 days. The location was ideal for our needs, near family and Intercity bus route. The minor areas for improvement are that the outdoor furniture and bathroom towels were worn out. However, I would highly recommend this hotel for efficiency, cleanliness and comfort.",Semeli Hotel
40,"What a welcoming hotel ! I have visited on business on 5 occasions over the past 3 years and on every return they not only remember my name, but clearly remember my face. While this is ego tickling, sometimes a little tickle goes a long way.Nicosia is the quietest and most laid back capital city I have ever visited and so getting to the office and business areas is easy. The hotel has good links to taxi firms and you rarely wait more than a few minutes for the Merc taxi to arrive.My room has always been street facing with a nice sizable balcony, large comfortable bed and good facilities. Complimentary fruit and small bottle of wine are also a nice touch.I never hesitate in booking the Semeli.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I stayed in Semeli on early April 2016 during a business trip in Cyprus. The room was nice. In particular, it was clean, well decorated, with soft mattress. Nevertheless, I would prefer more space available. I was not feeling comfortable working with my laptop on the bed.The breakfast was a decent continental one. The dinner included a variety of veal,chicken and pork dishes not something special but sufficient in quality and really tasty.The staff was helpful and friendly. In general terms I enjoyed the stayed in Semeli and I would visit it again.",Semeli Hotel
50,"1. Reception, restaurant, housekeeping staff - all very courteous and helpful2. Good choice and quality of food - all mealtimes3. Luxurious, comfy beds4. Well-stocked mini-bar5. High standard of cleanliness throughout6. Classy and elegant decor [in both bedrooms and public areas]",Semeli Hotel
50,"I am really a fun of Semeli hotel, their service is fabulous, very warm, you feel like your home. Clean, comfortable furniture, good food , vey relaxing atmosphere. I strongly propose it ! Taste the Greek Salad, grilled hallumi cheese and the 500gr marinaded pork steak !",Semeli Hotel
40,"Good, well appointed hotel tucked away in a quiet area. Room was large and clean, breakfast was above average for similar hotels I've been to. Not much to see in the immediate surroundings but friendly staff are always ready to hail a cab for you - everything seems to be within 10-15 minutes driving distance anyway. Only con was bathroom of one of my travelling companions leaked water.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I stayed in this hotel during almost 1 week during my business trip and I also spend a weekend afterwards in one of its suites with my wife. It's a really lovely hotel, very well taken care of. It is very clean, the rooms were spacious and the public places were also very clean. Nice bathroom with many utensils (e.g. sewing kit etc), excellent restaurant with delicious food and a good location, close to the central bank and with Kennedy Av. I also loved its breakfast!I did not find significant negative things, perhaps the mini bar could be a bit more rich, or I would like it if the restaurant offered a few more choices (for example no bolognaise when I asked about it). But these things are really minor.It is a beautiful hotel, the stuff is professional, polite and helpful, the food is excellent, free Wi-Fi is there and it is descent and it is also very clean.I loved it, my wife as well and we would definetely visit again. Absolutely recommended!",Semeli Hotel
40,"The room was nice and quiet, with only two negative points1- the mattress was far too soft, my back did not like it much.2 - the bathroom was strange with a shower curtain (not expected from the rest of the room furnitures) and the shower column was equipped with massage jets (but only for Tyrion Lannister...)Service was excellent and breakfast very nice as well.If I have another business trip in Nicosia, I would definitely consider this hotel.",Semeli Hotel
40,"This was the first time that I have stayed in this hotel and I found it to be very friendly and efficient. Particular positive points are:1) All the staff appear to be very friendly. At check-in, the bar, the restaurant etc.2) Free wifi throughout the whole hotel.3) Complimentary water and small bottle of wine in the room. (I'm not sure how regularly this gets replenished but it is very nice touch).4) I was worried that I had not brought an adaptor with me but found that the room accommodated a variety of different power sockets (both UK and US).5) A lot of amenities provided in the room.6) Nice patio area at the front of the hotel to sit out in the evening.Negative points:1) The room was rather small and dark despite having a double aspect.2) Given that just about everything else was provided I was surprised that there were no bathroom scales.3) Not that there is much that the hotel can do about it, but it would have been nice if the hotel had a swimming pool. There is a gym - but no pool.Overall my stay was a very positive and enjoyable experience. I would definitely return given the opportunity.",Semeli Hotel
50,"The Hotel is just off the main B1 road into Nicosia but in a quiet area and very easy to find. The reception area a lot of very comfortable seats and next door is a well stocked bar. The restaurant offers an excellent buffet and an ""a la carte menu"" if wanted. The food was superb and the house wine really good. The rooms are reasonably spacious and well furnished. The beds were comfortable, the air con. worked well and the shower was good. I can't think of anything bad to say about this hotel the staff go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The two staff members I mainly inter-acted with were Paola In reception who was exceptionally, friendly, helpful and most importantly efficient. Ahmed in the Bar and restaurant was just a very nice person who appeared to love his job. I don't want to go over the top, but I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and the staff here are exceptional. Would I stay here again - absolutely without any hesitation.",Semeli Hotel
40,"The conveniences you need, excellent wifi, the rooms are fine, though it was hard not to soak the bathroom floor when taking a shower. Lovely to have a balcony and the fresh April air was very welcome. The seats outside the entrance are a nice touch. Pleasant staff. Very adequate, nothing to rave about. Odd location though.",Semeli Hotel
40,A nice hotel in a good location. The stuff is very polite and helpful. The rooms are clean well equipped but a little small.The gym is very small about 35 - 40 m2. The breakfast is a simple buffet but in good quality food. Restaurant have good food in good price. Parking is free but with few parking spots. WiFi free around the hotel but not very strong and fast. As final conclusion Is a good hotel that I suggest and I definitely I will visit again.,Semeli Hotel
40,"I visit Nicosia at least once a year and have always stayed at the Semeli for the sole reason it's location, which is close to where most of my family live.My past review was not very favourable but after this last visit I am happy to upgrade my previous comments.Location has always been great, in the past the hotel has let it's guests down with service, cleanliness and overall feeling of being unwelcome.This has vastly improved and I can with ease of conscience recommend it.There are still problems which I have been told by the management are being addressed. So by my next visit I will be able to rate this hotel 5.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Overall - great hotel. Though the location is not great if you want to stay in the city center (it is approx. 25 minutes walk from the hotel), but it was close to the areas where we needed. The room was equipped with all the necessities, it even had complimentary drinks. Everything was great except the noise - the isolation was very poor, I could hear people walking down the corridor and shouting all night long (my room was on the way to the stairs), so this was quite disturbing.Breakfast was descent and quite ok.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Enjoyed staying a few days at the hotel, and everything worked smoothly!Well-working front dest, that ensured swift check-in at 03h45 and check-out a few days later at 02:45.The room was fine, with everything needed: Excellent bed; free WiFi (accessible throughout the hotel); decent work space; balcony, essential since I have not been able to kick the horrible smoking habit; complimentary water (and wine!); and enough clothes hangers to unpack properl, essential since like this like other hotels I have stayed at in Cyprus does not offer in-room iron/board.Breakfast was also fine - with a reasonable coffee machine preventing the coffee-delay that cheese me off in so many hotels ...Did not try the restaurant for lunch/dinner or the bar.The location is also fine, close to the city center and just off the main road into Nicosia from the airport.I would not mind coming back.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Stayed here for a week. The hotel looks good from the outside, like it should have been at a beach or so :) It looks good inside, too, with some oil paintings and a few separate sitting areas, including one outside, one at the reception and of course, the bar. Staff was courteous and very helpful. My wife had forgotten her laptop during checkout, but they kept it safe and returned it to us.",Semeli Hotel
50,Great hotel and an excellent service. We had a room with Jacuzzi and a welcome package. Highly recommend. WiFi connection was super. The Breakfast is sufficient enough to start your day. Thanks a lot for the hospitality!!!,Semeli Hotel
50,We organized a Graduation Ceremony event on the bar of the Hotel.The food and the atmosphere was excellent. The staff was very organized and helpful.We will choose Semeli Hotel for our next event for sure!,Semeli Hotel
40,"Semeli is a nice and quiet hotel mostly visited for business. It was my 4th time at his hotel. This time I had a better room with a jacuzzi and a big bed but the previous times it was quite good as well. There was a small problem with the bathroom because of the water coming out at the floor after a bath. It is not very close to the historical city center of Nicosia. It is about 20minutes fast walking. I don't think that I would select it as a ""holidays"" hotel but it is really convenient for business visitors who have to be close to the Nicosia Center. The staff is friendly and kind. I was not really satisfied with the breakfast and especially with the scrambled eggs & coffee quality.",Semeli Hotel
20,"At the end of the day all a hotel is a place to sleep and shower (IBIS gets this right!). I just stayed 2 nights there with very little sleep and the bathroom had a huge flood when I used the shower.I checked in late, and my room was 28 degrees. So, I had a very poor sleep as I sweated and listen to the rattle of a very ineffective air conditioner.In the morning when I asked to see the manager, I did not- but was connected by phone. He was VERY rude and argumentative. Could not have cared less that I didn't get any sleep.The next night was not much better- the very bright overhead light randomly turned on waking me up. I had to climb on a chair and unscrew the light bulb.I had an 'executive room' which I think means you have a large and extremely ugly sofa in the room. And a view of a decrepit apartment building.Nicosia seems to be a very underserved hotel market, with only the Hilton providing international standards- and commensurate pricing.One thing for sure- I will never attempt to get a good sleep or shower at the Semeli!",Semeli Hotel
50,"Great Service, very friendly staff, very good wifi connection. Traveled on business stayed 5 days. Good prices and it has what a business traveler needs. Would recommend. It is not close to the old city, but it is close to a few restaurants. Old city centre is at a walks distance if you like to walk a bit. Breakfast was very good.",Semeli Hotel

Nicosia is in the middle of Cyprus.2. Breakfast has an ok spread. Not the biggest but adequate.GOOD POINTS1. Excellent service. Most of the staff are proficient in english and offer service with a smile.2. free undercover parking3. superior room is spacious and has a lovely jacuzzi with funky lighting in the bathroom.4. nice deep tub in the room to soak and relax.4.

Cyprus mall is only 5 minutes drive.8. nice contemporary feel to the lobby.all in all it was a great stay. I would highly recommend to any traveller especially families.,Semeli Hotel
50,"This hotel is not in the middle of the old city of Nicosia, but if you don't mind to walk for a 15-20 minutes (or use public or private transport) to the center, then it is very recomandable.Very well equipped and clean room and a bathroom. Very kind and helpfull staff - for instance, even I didn't ask them, they told me to stay after the check out (I had a flight in late afternoon). Nice breakfast.Quiet location.",Semeli Hotel
50,"We have stayed in the Semeli for work four times now, and every time we have been impressed by the outstanding service orientation of the staff here. This is not the flashiest or best located hotel in town, but I have no doubt that there in not a hotel in Nicosia where a guest will feel more looked after. Every single member of staff is friendly, efficient, professional and offers service with a real smile. The wonderful part is that this positive experience has improved every time we have visited, and includes the amazing front-of-house staff, restaurant staff and the housekeeping team. We compared the current summer rates to that of the Hilton which is a stone's throw away, and the latter will cost you more than 100 Euro per night more than the Semeli! The hotel restaurant's dinner menu offers lovely hearty meals, of which the pork sheftalia deserves special mention. The restaurant has a lovely selection of really good Cypriot wines, too. A pity that there is no pool and that some guests do smoke in their rooms despite the kind requests everywhere to not smoke inside, but outside on the balconies.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I would definitely recommend Semeli hotel to the people who are on a business trip as it is conveniently located next to the central bank of cyprus and to many other banks in the center of Nicosia. The rooms are clean, the bed mattresses and pillows are orthopedic. The bathrooms are equipped with all types of toiletries (the only disadvantage is that the bathrooms are small). The service is great and the staff in the reception are quite polite, especially the supervisor.",Semeli Hotel
30,"it is ok for a businees trip.i would not suggest it for families.it is 20' away from center and walking around is .... usefull if you want to get an insight of ""suburb"" downtown.breakfast was below expectations, trying to be classic engilsh breakfast, but... tste was lower than average.fantastic bed i must admit. sleeping with open windows and stil you get a lot of silence.",Semeli Hotel

50,I wouldn't hesitate to come back to Semeli hotel they have been fantastic very hospitable and helpful all staff were friendly and approachable and helped as much as they could with things to do and places to visit during our stay on top of this the room was amazing great value,Semeli Hotel
50,"First excellent and highly intelligent staff like beautiful Paola treat you as if you are the most important VIP on the plant. This is a place that really knows how the hospitality business should be run! The beds are comfy-there's complimentary wine and water and the toilet's bath is so luxurious you want to make time for a bath. Close to the heart of old Nicosia-the area behind the ancient walls is within easy reach. Yes-the Hilton is closer, but corporation hotels can't deliver what this family hotel does. I look forward to returning.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Semeli hotel is a nice hotel with friendly atmosphere. Rooms ok, clean and big enough, food also ok. City center on 20 minutes by walk. Breakfast room is rather small but this was not a problem during my stay.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I had a chance to stay at Semeli for 2 weeks during a business visit. The hotel is cozy and the staff is extremely friendly and warm! Rooms are small yet cozy and the stay was comfortable. Only 1 feedback, lighting in the bathroom is poor in most rooms (you put the shower curtain and it gets reasonably dark)",Semeli Hotel
50,"The day was outstanding, and the way the hotel were able to take our ideas and implement was truly exceptional. We can't speak highly enough, they really did exceed our expectations and made our day extremely special. Everyone worked exceptionally hard to make this happen. The staff provided an absolutely fantastic service from beginning to end. The reception was truly second to none, what really made it was the attention to detail, the room & table decoration, food, service and general fell of the day were excellent. A majority of our guests also made specific comment about the hotel, food, service and general conduct as they really did provide a truly outstanding day for everyone that was there. We couldn't have asked for better value. The location is also brilliant. We would highly recommend Semeli hotel and would like to thank to all staff especially Mr Nicolaou for a wonderful wedding.",Semeli Hotel
20,It was my first experience with this hotel; I consider this hotel to be expensive and low value for money with respect to other hotels in the area. It is not close to the city center (one cannot easily walk the distance) and the only impressive feature is its rustic lobby.The rest are average to poor for the price.,Semeli Hotel
40,"My company booked me at the hotel and I was pleasantly surprised with its cosy atmosphere, and friendly staff.It took me a bit back to the 80s style of hotels in Greece and the Eastern part of the Mediterranean; in a positive way, due to the style of interior and artwork and furniture/decor.I had a very good stay, the place is well run, clean and safe.The only thing I would really advise them on, is changing the lighting in the bathrooms. I would really like to challenge the hotel manager to try and shave in the dimly white-lit bathroom.Overall a good place to stay for business while in Nicosia.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I realy liked this hotel. The staff was very courteous and excellent. I had to cut short my stay by one day, and they were very accommodating. THe internet was excellent. THe breakfast was good. The price was extremely good. I would highly recommend.",Semeli Hotel

40,"This visit was a positive experience, a well kept clean and very comfortable room with good wifi, very helpful staff and a good breakfast. I stayed here for one week.For convenience on one evening I ate in the hotel restaurant. It was ok, reasonably priced but nothing to write home about. Given the enormous choice of restaurants in Nicosia it was perhaps understandably empty.The 25 minute walk to the old town is easy enough to navigate.",Semeli Hotel
40,I have stayed at this hotel for a business Trip in Nicosia. The Hotel is very well placed. The staff is very friendly and the standards of the Hotel are quite high. The breakfast is rich of both quantity and quality. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Would recommend the hotel especially for Business trips.,Semeli Hotel
50,"The hotel presnts everything you would accpet from a good hotel - clean, comfortable, good breakfast.

40,"The hotel is located quite well, especially you have a car as they also offer covered parking. The staff was always friendly and helpful and it was nice dealing with them. They even offered us a free late checkout. We also received complimentary wine and fruit in the room which was a nice touch. The hotel was clean, altough they forgot to make up our room once.Unfortunataley, during our stay (maybe because the hotel was near-empty), the breakfast did not live up to the pictures on their web site, We had to ask for breakfast items and the buffet selection was rather limited.Overall, I recommend tha hotel.",Semeli Hotel

From the first minute until our chech out, everything was designed in a proffessional way. The dining room had a romantic mood, the dinner was especially designed for that special night. The music backround was exactly what my expectations were. The spacious room had all the necessary staff for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. All staff were willing to help. I strongly reccommend Semeli Hotel for all its services for any occasion, business trip, leisure, educational etc.",Semeli Hotel

Very good value for money, they listen and take everything you say on board.The sleep quality in this hotel is very good, listening to previous reviews we requested a high floor and were given the 5 th floor. The beds are extremely comfortable, we booked a standard room and were given robes and slippers (usually for executive rooms other hotels). The room was not enormous, but more than adequate. Special touches such as a complimentary 1/2 bottle of wine and fruit and water in the room on arrival. The mini bar prices were extremely fair. Substantial toiletries in the bathroom, inc a comb, razor and shaving cream, toothbrush etc. excellent, except we had to request a shower cap. The bathroom had an all singing all dancing shower, so it must have been an oversight not to have a shower cap. However, whenever we made a request it was dealt with almost immediately.The breakfast is fairly standard, but all in all this hotel provides impeccable service from their fantastic staff.There is an underground car park. The hotel is situated in the business area of the city, so we used taxis to/ from the city centre costing around 5 euros each way. The bonus is that the hotel is in a quiet area so you are not kept awake by the noises associated with a busy neighbourhood.We will most certainly return to his hotel on future visits.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Where do I begin, this is a fantastic hotel. From the time of checking to us checking out the hotel was a delight to stay in.Firstly this hotel is spotlessly clean and we had no issue with the décor the lounge was comfortable and there is plenty of parking under the hotel.All the staff were fantastic, helpful, friendly and so very polite. Paola on reception is delightful and was most helpful.The rooms are very comfortable, with every amenity possible. Safe, TV, coffee tray, slippers, dressing gown and complimentary shower gels. The beds were very comfortable and I experienced no difficulties with the heating/air conditioning. Complementary wine, fruit and water greets you which is an excellent touch.My mum had a slight drain smell coming from the bath in her room but a brief chat with reception and it was sorted by the time we arrived back at the hotel in the evening.I have travelled to many country’s and stayed in many good hotels and I can honestly say for me this room was by far the best equipped.We ate in the restaurant two evenings while we were there and we found the menu to be excellent and very reasonable prices. The food was lovely and delicious and the waitresses were very helpful and polite.The buffet breakfast offered was excellent: On offer there was toast, fresh rolls, rolls, croissants (choc and plain), fresh fruit, cheese, ham, tomato, cucumber, and a choice of two cereals (muesli and cornflakes). Hot food: Bacon, frankfurters, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, beans, mushrooms and cooked tomatoes. Fresh juice, tea, my favourite was the decent coffee machine!!! What more could you possibly ask for to set you up for the day.The hotel is very convenient for Nicosia for business or other. This hotel is building up a fine reputation and it is well deserved.We had to fly to Cyprus for a family emergency and we had the choice of staying at the Hilton near by, but after reading reviews on trip advisor decided to stay here instead without the price tag of the Hilton. We are so glad we did and we are looking forward to staying again at this wonderfully run hotel on our planned return next month.",Semeli Hotel
30,"Stayed in this Hotel several times over the past 16 months.The rooms are a good size, sadly the taste in furniture is extremely poor, not helped by very poor lighting, bathrooms have a jacuzzi which takes up most of the space and totally un-nessasary a shower would have been more piratical for this business hotel.The public parts of the hotel has no soul and is actually a dead space, the only person who sits there is the owner and friends. Didn't go into the bar.On two occasions my room was not ready, nor did I get the room I requested, the last visit they couldn't find the booking though it was made well in advance with the general manager.This hotel need someone to take charge and turn it into a city business hotel, the potential is there and so is the demand.And yes I would stay there again, the only reason is it's convenient location. The alternative would be the aged Hilton at three times the price.",Semeli Hotel
50,"We had a two night break at the Semeli with our 4 and 5 year old boys in between Xmas and New Year. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel very welcome by all the staff, who were polite, friendly and attentive to our needs at all times. Our family room was perfectly adequate, and the boys were more than comfortable on their sofa bed. We stopped on a bed and breakfast basis. The selection and quality of food was as good as I've seen in more prestigious hotel chains. We didn't venture out too late in the evening, and took the opportunity to eat from the bar menu, which was very reasonably priced and was good quality. We managed to park our car in the underground car park, which was free. All in all, we had a very enjoyable short break, and if we were visiting Nicosia again, would have no concerns about revisiting the Semeli.",Semeli Hotel
50,"For my second time in Cyprus for business reasons, I was once more delighted by the lovely atmosphere of this hotel, boasting of very young and qualified people who don't miss to make every effort for the wellbeing of their guests. A particular mention should be given to the reception staff that is always at disposal for every necessity and requirements. The structure as a whole is well-designed and rich in fashion and appeal, both for business men, tourists and what else!",Semeli Hotel
40,The rooms are on the small side and the bathrooms can do with a bit more light.However the location is very convenient and the staff very helpful and friendly.Overall a good impression. Will stay there again.,Semeli Hotel
40,A very good value hotel in the heart of Nicosia. Service in the bar can be a little slow at times but the staff are very friendly and helpful. Sound proofing in the bedrooms to the outside could be a little better.,Semeli Hotel
50,"One month ago we had our wedding venue at Semeli Hotel! It was by far the best choice we made for our wedding, we had a big reception of 1.500 guest and a dinner of another 250 guest. The general manager was a valuable person to us for the past year supporting our dream and helping us make it real. The reception hall being glamour and classic on its own needed only few details, the dinner hall being modern and sheik allowed us to create our vision. The service we got, the food and beverages on both halls were remarkable... It's been a month and we are still getting compliments for it from our guests. It was the best value for money choice as we made with good and affordable prices we had the best service. The suite and rooms for our guest... Fabulous! Clean! Relaxing! Everything you need after the long day! We truly thank the general manager and the staff for their services, friendly ness and support to our special day. We truly recommend Semeli Hotel! Loukia & Kyriakos",Semeli Hotel
50,"Very friendly staff at the reception, a nice breakfast buffet and a comfortable room, equipped with bathrobes, complimentary wine red and white, to mention just a few things, will keep my stay here in a fond memory. The location close to the University, the bus stop to Larnaca and to old City are further points in favour of this hotel.",Semeli Hotel
50,"We are a Business Consulting Organization based in Nicosia, hosting various EU projects meetings per year. Number of participants vary from 10-40 people. Hosting the regarding meetings in Semeli Hotel has been our pleasure since we are getting every time the compliments of our partners regarding the meeting venue, the catering service, the food & accommodation but mostly the friendliness of the hotel staff. For sure, we recommend it to all businesses of the island in hosting their meetings as well as for accommodation purposes!",Semeli Hotel
40,"Excellent Service, very friendly stuff, fast wifi connection. It has everything you are looking for in a hotel for a business trip. Maybe they should consider creating something like a members club and privileged rates. Very nice experience in general.",Semeli Hotel
50,"I stayed at the Semeli for week while attending a conference at the nearby University of Cyprus. I've got nothing but praise for the hotel. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. My room was great - good size, nice little balcony, very clean bathroom. It's often only when you have a problem that you find out what the standard of service is really like. The air conditioning became quite noisy after a couple of days and then stopped but was fixed as soon as I reported it without any fuss. The restaurant was very good and the bar. Another good sign of a quality hotel is when the bartender recognises you when you come in at the end of the day and remembers what sort of beer you drink!Other conference delegates stayed at the (more expensive) Hilton nearby but stories of very crowded breakfast times and other joys of a large hotel made me glad I'd chosen the smaller and much more relaxed Semeli.Location is excellent for the University but it's a bit of a trek into the city centre. It's really not too far to walk in terms of distance but in the heat of the day this is probably not a good idea. There's a good bus service which runs from the main road with a stop about 200 m away but buses stop running very early in the evening so it's a taxi or a walk back if its cooler by then.Overall, excellent value for money and an enjoyable stay in all respects.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Everything is really excellent from the service to the courtesy of the employees,very comfortable rooms and adegute, high quality restaurant service,the structure and positioned in a strategic position for both business and leisure travelers alike. overall the best thing I liked is the service and the friendliness of the staff and the quiet and comfortable guestrooms.",Semeli Hotel

50,"Came here to stay second time and found the hotel to be best in this class in Nicosia. The hotel staff is nice, helpful and quick. Toms are tidy but with excellent condition and comfort. The hotel is located in the center of city very close to Hilton, therefore easily accessible. The hotel is new with brand new furnishings.",Semeli Hotel

40,"My wife and I had to be in Nicosia General Hospital for her to have a bone scan, on 22nd August 2013 and we decided to book over night in a hotel, as we live in Paphos, a two hour drive from Nicosia. We booked this hotel as it did not seem far from the General Hospital.We arrived at the hotel about 1315hrs, parking underground was not possible as the car park had been cordoned off with card board boxes, I mentioned this to the Receptionist, Paula, by the time we had booked in and got to our room she had telephoned and arranged a parking spot for me in the underground car park, excellent service.The hotel is clean and spacious and the rooms are very clean & tidy, beds are really big and comfortable. The touches in the bathroom of comb, toothbrush, sewing kit and the usual assorted gels was well received. The shower was really powerful, welcome after a long drive in humid conditions The staff are very polite and courteous, only too willing to help. The bar, restaurant and rest areas are clean and welcoming and the service is good. I will be using this hotel again should I ever have to stay in Nicosia.",Semeli Hotel
40,"The Semeli hotel is a relatively new addition having been built in 2011, and a very positive newcomer to the Nicosia scene. The reception area is pleasant and comfortable, and there is a decent bar area and restaurant.The rooms are very clean and well maintained. Though the decor won't be too everyone's taste, the quite traditional furnishings and paintings make for a characterful and personal environment.The beds are comfortable, there is a very serviceable desk in the rooms and a balcony which gives a nice view over Nicosia from the higher floors. There is free Wifi in the rooms, which is of average speed, and a kettle with tea bags and instant coffee is provided. The highlight of the room is the great shower, which has multiple settings including massage and can also be used as a sauna. One weakness of the room is the limited space for the toilet in the bathroom, you are quite squashed between the shower and the wall, and if you are built large you are likely to find this a squeeze. The complementary water, wine and fruit on arrival is a nice touch.Breakfast was fine, a combination of hot items and a typically Greek selection of cold cuts, yogurt etc. Staff were pleasant.The hotel is not right in the centre of Nicosia, but the area is pleasant and it is easy enough to get around.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Semeli Hotel is offering all what you really want when you are visiting Nicosia for business purposes. Spacious, comfortable and clean rooms (in all floors) with big beds and all needed amenities . Always polite and helpful employees that are always keen to provide service and assistance. Breakfast is moderate in variety but enough to feel satisfied with the quality offered. Free Wi-Fi connection in all hotel areas is something that will surely surprise you. Last but not least, the hotel is located close to the center of the town in a real quiet neighborhood.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Semeli hotel is a great place to stay in Nicosia, although I was only there for one night, I had a very good experience.

Recommended to the travellers visiting Nicosia.",Semeli Hotel
50,"I stay for 3 nights in this hotel, during a conference in Nicosia, and it was indeed a nery nice place to stay. The room was spacious and the stuff very friendly.

50,"Every Saturday night, Semeli Hotel hosts a milonga. Milonga is the night when tango dancers meet to dance. As a tango dancer I went to Semeli Hotel with my friends to join the milonga.As we were hungry, we wanted to have a meal at the restaurant of the hotel. I was not very enthusiactic about the hotel food but there was nothing else to do.Thank God we had no other alternatives otherwise we would never be able to experience such a good taste. We had Pink Lady which was salmon and homemade Semeli burger. They were both fantastic. I would like to extend my compliments to the chef from here. He/she is a great cook.. Definitely... The price?? Very reasonable...15 Euro for a fantastic salmon meal and 8.50 for the burger in a very clean and presentable atmosphere..The amount of the food was so big that I couldn't even finish all ( as a big eater):)))I also heard that there is an open buffet on Saturdays when there is enough crowd and it is fantastıc as well for 15 Euro..We had a great milonga in a beautiful hall with great and reasonable service.The cleanliness of the hotel was exceptional as well.",Semeli Hotel
30,"Nothing special to say . An ok hotel ,clean and ordinary. Bad led lighting messes up your mood but the beds and the pillows at least are very comfy . Reception feels worn out . Nice surprise that they serve you a welcoming drink (cumantaria) when you enter for the first time . Amenities of the bathroom are low quality and breakfast not something special. Internet connection ok and the entrance of the hotel full with leather old fashioned furniture . Personnel quite friendly and warm .",Semeli Hotel
50,"A perfect place to spend your nights after work! To begin with the matress which is perfect and after the pillows ( 2 of them ). You fill totally ready to begin again you day to work.The room was clean and very comfortable , the restaurant and the bar also amazing!!the was a buffet also on eof the nights i was there and it was amazing.The most amazing was the staff so helful and kind much better than a five star hotel.Thank you Semeli staff!!!",Semeli Hotel
40,"A 3-night business trip. The location is slightly inconvenient if you want to do things downtown, but otherwise the hotel is fine. The two double beds in my room had a tendency to slide on the polished floors. The internet speed is glacial - there were numerous other guests who complained about that. It really only worked down in the lobby. Other than that, a nice place.",Semeli Hotel
50,"I have just returned back from the always sunny Cyprus. I spent three days at the Semeli Hotel in Nicosia for a European meeting. What to say? Only good remarks: the hotel lies in a very quiet and clean area of Nicosia, offering a nice and friendly atmosphere. Rooms are well-furnished and fully equipped. To be mentioned is in particular the extreme kindness of staff members, all of them young people very committed to make sure that their guests can enjoy the best of Cypriot famous hospitality. And last but not least: Cypriot food is really unforgettable, beyond my best expectations!!",Semeli Hotel
40,"After several meetings i had in the semeli hotel i can say that it is probably the best hotel for seminars and hosting foreigners. Reasonable prices, quiet, very good services and always willing to help youI recommend it for sure",Semeli Hotel
40,"I have stayed 2-3 times in Semeli hotel always for business, hotel started last year and it's new in the beginning it had all the problems of new buildings but after a while it's getting improved, food is OK but breakfast is with limited options, there is no swimming pool and meeting rooms are in the basement with no natural light, rooms have a good but small bathroom usually very clean with things you need for morning fresh up the worst thing about rooms are their LED white light this kind of light drives me crazy in this hotel you can have good Internet I can recommend hotel for 2-3 days trip to Nicosia.",Semeli Hotel
50,"Stayed there for 5 days, for business purposes. Hotel room was very comfortable, with the balcony (salvation for smokers), big bathroom and coffee machine. The only problem was an internet access, which was very poor in the room, but very good everywhere else, including the corridor outside rooms, and free (unlike Hilton hotel, which charged internet access to everyone, including members of the conference organized in their hotel). Breakfast was very nice with various offers. Room was clean and guests are welcomed with fruit and little bottle of Cyprus wine.But what is really the hidden treasure of this hotel is - staff. I travel a lot, but have never, I repeat, never, had a chance to see such hotel staff. They treat you as their home guests, doing everything to make you feel welcome and dear guests. I have just asked for general information about Larnaca sightseeing and the lady on the reception desk did a real research what to see in Larnaca, how to get there, where to eat or maybe stay for the night, and her report was waiting for me that evening. Not to mention that they replied to every call and request,and their attitude which made you feel home.I have never really thought that staff could be a crucial factor for choosing the hotel. But in case of Semeli - they are. Thanks to them, Semeli will be my choice if I ever have chance to visit Nicosia again.",Semeli Hotel
30,"I spent 3 nights in this hotel for business purposes. As I heard it was a quite new hotel but I have to admit, I did not notice. Hard to describe the style of the hotel, the rooms are relatively small and I have never seen such a small bathroom, even one person can hardly fit in. They have full variety of amenities and change the towels daily without asking for it. The breakfast was good, if you want to drink a good coffe you have to pay 4eur extra.",Semeli Hotel
50,I cannot fault the service or the facilities at this hotel. We have hosted two conferences there now and the service has been second to none. Nothing was to much trouble and the staff are amazing. Adrian in particular offered unparalleled levels of service.,Semeli Hotel
40,"Stayed here for a week whilst working nearby and The Semeli is an ideal business hotel. Very clean (there always seems to be a cleaner mopping a floor somewhere), comfortable rooms and I was impressed that they have orthopaedic pillows on the beds. Staff were all very friendly and incredibly efficient. A good selection of food in the restaurant, which I would class as 'simple food done well'. The location is only a short ride from town and my only criticism is that there is no pool to enjoy on my last day when I don't need to work. That said, it still makes an ideal and comfortable place to stay for a business trip, backed up with good witeless Internet access throughout the hotel included for free. A very enjoyable stay and I would be happy to recommend to colleagues.",Semeli Hotel
50,"I 've stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks during February 2012 due to a business trip.The hotel offers 5* star hotel services, both concerning the room facilities as well as the food/beverage and the overall service.

Not to leave out the high standards of hygiene throughout the hotel.I would definetely recommend a stay at Semeli, Nicosia. Take this advice from a welll travelled person that loves confort, style and luxury...",Semeli Hotel
40,"I stayed last weekend at this hotel for a polymer clay workshop.It is recently built, so everything looks fresh, clean and new. The staff are very helpful and the rooms well appointed, with mini bar, tea/coffee tray, bath robes and all the usual complimentary items in the bathroom. Each room has a balcony. The beds were very comfortable, with a firm and a softer pillow on each one. I paid 120 euro a night half board. The food was very good. Lovely fresh salads and buffet style entrees. My only complaint is that the corridor outside the room is noisy. There is no carpet on the floor to muffle people going to their rooms, and the doors to the rooms slam shut very loudly. Luckily I had brought ear plugs with me!There is nothing much to see around the hotel, so need to take a taxi to the old city.",Semeli Hotel
40,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The review from Iola S is a bit strange as the Hilton is 100Eu per night more expensive for b+b so check the price for yourself.The hotel is aimed at the business market, so had a quiet feel to it as people seemed to take evening meals as room service and were out fairly early in the mornings. However the hotel would also serve as a good base for tourists visiting the city. A pleasant 15 min walk or approx 6Eu taxi ride gets you to the old town.The hotel is obviously new, the public areas are very pleasant and the hotel has a nice look to it. The guest rooms and the public areas are very clean. The breakfast was fine, a buffet with the usual hot and cold food. We ate in the restaurant twice in our stay, the food was reasonably priced and there was a choice of snacky foods (toasted sandwiches with fries) or more substantial 3 course meals. On both occassions our meal was good, well cooked, tasty and plenty of it.The staff were, without fail, friendly and helpful. Following a fall and a swollen ankle (watch out for the pavements in Nicosia) as we limped back into the hotel and explained our predicament the staff went to get some ice wrapped in a towel to use as a compress (and again the next day).The leisure facilities are limited to a gym and sauna. The gym looks brand new (unused brand new!) with a good range of equipment.The only thing that we weren't too keen on was the lighting in the rooms, corridors and stairwells. The corridors and stairwells used a motion detector to switch the lights on, so when you entered these areas they were initially very dark at night time. The lights came on quickly but it looked a bit unwelcoming. In the room the lights were LEDs. These are very directional so the rooms ended up feeling a bit gloomy without a wide spread of light. I don't think you get full spectrum light with these either but that's a minor gripe.The bathrooms were a little on the small side, but had all the toiletries that you would need. The shower was over a bath - but the bath didn't have any taps. Maybe you get these in an executive room !Overall a clean good quality hotel. A good base for the city whether for business or tourism with very helpful and friendly staff.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Spent one there over a weekend for a black-tie dinner. The hotel is new so was spotless throughout. Staff were very accommodating and all the facilities in good condition. It's purely a sleeping-over hotel; no additional facilities so probably priced a bit high, considering the Hitlon is adjacent. That said, enjoyed the experience.",Semeli Hotel
40,"Bit of an "" odd "" review as I have not actually stayed at The Hotel but attended a 2 day Business Conference there as it is barely three minutes walk from where I live.Recently opened Hotel and knowing most of the delegates saw many of the different Rooms & Suites ,all excellent , and all delegates very happy with service , facilities and in particular the friendliness/helpfulness of Staff.Situated only 500 metres from the more prestigious Cyprus Hilton at possibly half the cost why pay Hilton prices which is only 500 metres away ??",Semeli Hotel
50,"Located just across from the national bank, near the Hilton and about 15 minutes walk from the old city, the Semeli hotel is a lovely choice in Nicosia. The hotel itself is lovely. The hotel is new and the lobby, bar and restaurant are all very nicely decorated and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There's free parking if you've rented a car and the location is convenient. It's an easy 15 minute walk through nice shopping streets to old town Nicosia.We'd booked online a room with two twin beds and specifically asked in the booking if we could get them joined up. When we arrived, that's exactly what we got. Our room was nice, reasonably sized with a balcony and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom wasn't large, but had sufficient space and all the fixtures were new and very nice - particularly the multiple shower heads to choose from. There was a coffee pot in room, as well as a complementary water battle and local wine and a full range of bath products including toothbrushes and a razor.Our rate included breakfast which was 7-10 daily and had a nice range of buffett options (cereals, yoghuts, english and continental breakfast options and fresh fruit). We enjoyed having an evening drink in the bar, which was comfortable, could serve the full restaurant menu and had very friendly staff.Overall, starting with our complementary welcome sample of the local liqueur on check in we enjoyed our stay at the Semeli.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I stayed at Semeli Hotel the last week during a business trip and I am really amazed by the quality of the services and hospitality of the Manager,but also all the staff. We had quite a lot of unexpected arrangements to make and referred to the hotel for assistance. The Manager and the staff members did always their best to satisfy our requests, even if it was at a very short notice.I also liked the rooms which were very clean, nice and comfortable.I will definitely stay at Semeli hotel next time I am in Cyprus.",Semeli Hotel
40,"I am a Travel Agent, and I have visited the newly build hotel several times over the last week for inspection and introduction to prospective clients. The quality of the construction is very good. Air condition was everywhere - even gym room.Rooms were very comfortable, suitable for business people with wifi in the room and very modern furniture, good matress, clean with modern bathrooms some with jacuzi.Ok! the hotel has recently open its doors. But, I believe already Nicosia needed a new 3star hotel. And definately, it is a 3star +. After few months, the hotel will not be able to meet demand in rooms. This week I am aware the hotel was full the whole period.",Semeli Hotel
