10,Permanently closed. Did not intend to book this hotel but my hotel reception told me stop by this hotel to wait for them to pick me up. Found this place from google map and found out that it has been closed permanently. Its visible in trip advisor still too. Thanks to google map.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
50,"This hotel is well located and has a great beach, with views of the Turkish border mountain range. Would recommend the local bars and restaurants, 30 second to the beach great place nice staff easy parking set back from main drag",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"The Holiday Inn has a very good location, being situated close to the centre of Nicosia and it's best tourist attractions.The hotel itself has an antique air, maybe this is the reason why the wifi was free only in the lobby area and the one in the room had to be paid for.We arrived early, before check in time, but we had the possibility to store our luggage until the appropiate time of receiving the room. The rooms were clean, quite small but the bathroom was spacious enough.The restaurant had the best view, located at the top of the building, being spectacular especially during the night time: you could see most of Nicosia - greek and turkish. The food wasn't impressive. Some of the meals being either undercooked or overcooked. Vegetarian menu quite reduced.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
50,Very nice hotel.In down town close to shopping and town.The rooms were good not very big. The staff was very friendly and accommodativeCould improve a bit on amenities. Good for business as it location is superb.Nice restaurant,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"The hotel is located in the old town, which is the centre of the town.The rooms are equipped with old furniture and they are not the cleanest hotel rooms I have ever visited. The WiFi service is available free only in the lobby.The breakfast was very nice.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"Having read the reviews of this hotel, my wife and I were a bit apprehensive about our booking. Thankfully, our doubts were soon dispelled. Yes it has seen better days but also yes, it is good value for money. Great location for the sights on both the Cyprus and the Turkish Occupied side. I had asked for a quiet room and we were provided with one on the 5/F overlooking the buffer zone and the border. In the distance was the Turkish flag in the hillside and close by the empty buildings adjacent to the border.Breakfast was not the best we have had but, to be honest, adequate. The room was kept clean and although there were one or two minor problems, we thought it to be up to what we expected.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for a peasant stay in a fantastic location. Do not expect a 5 star hotel because you will not get it. What you will get is a hotel that serves its purpose at a price you can afford.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"We made one mistake. Booked it in addition to the flight without checking tripadviser. This hotel is not worth the money. It is dated and not maintained. The air conditioning is extremely loud, the hair dryer did not work, the TV lacks the remote so it was useless. Staff knocks on the door at 8am to clean up the room, even on the day of checkout.It might have been a good hotel years ago but that's long gone.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"Now no longer the holiday inn, this hotel appears to be running down, although friendly staff and nice spot it appears tired, poorly cleaned and run down, food ok at breakfast but simple. Really needs modernising and a fresh start.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"Location of this hotel is very good, however the hotel needs serious renovation. It's a budget hotel, so I didn't expected much.- Wi-fi access to the Internet is payable- staff in the bar and restaurant were friendly and helpful- receptionists could use a training how to be more service minded... I had a feeling they don't won't to be there...- room was not the cleanest I have seen- bads are OK- some furniture and TV is worn out and needs to be replaced, although beds and some furniture in the room were new. Also the floor was new.- bathroom is worn out and not really clean. Towels were changed regulary.- Air conditioning is not working, according to the receptionist it's not working in the entire hotel- bed was nice and comfortable- poor sound isolation on the outside and inside.- self service breakfast and variety of food to choose from, standard hotel quality.- coffee was not drinkable- I used a sauna and swimming pool once and I was really concerned about hiagenic conditions. Also inventory needs to be refurbished.It's a budget hotel. Don't expect too much. Me personally, I wouldn't stay in this hotel anymore. As a business guest I expect much more from 4* hotel.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,Located near the old town . The room was clean and the bed has very nice and soft mattress . I do not like you have to pay for internet 10 euros. The TV is in the wrong place and the cables hanging badly on the wall. So it is a not bad and not very good hotel.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,Stayed 1 night recently and was given an excutive room on the first floor which was really large and well appointed with loads of space. Walking through the door one can only be impressed with the communal area but the checking in process wasnt the moost friendly and checking out the next morning was really slow as there was only 1 member of staff on duty.Breakfast in the morning was ok with a fair choice. Unfortunately I didn't get chance to use any of the fitness and spa facilities but would imagine they would be pretty good.Had the reception process been slicker and more friendly it iyuls get a 5 star rating.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"If you are looking for a luxury hotel then this is not. At best it's about 2.5 star. It is located centrally in Nicosia for easy access to many areas but convenience is all it is. The hotel has changed its name to Nicosia City Center Hotel under the new owners. However they need to train receptionists to have a smile and be more customer oriented, can put you off a bit. The rooms are not special at all and in need of a revamp. Lighting in the bathroom is terrible. Two small lights by the sink is inadequate for a bathroom. You can't see anything while showering or taking a bath. We also found ants crawling up the towels! There also lots of noise about with cars, the prayers from the minorets and pipes clicking - most pronounced at night. Also beware you are NOT told there are floors for smoking and non smoking. Guess what we were given!!Breakfast is also very basic just like the hotel. Overall if you must go minimise the stay for comfort.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"I usually book in this hotel for its good location.This time I had a horrible experience. I asked the receptionist for a late checkout (paid for sure) and she told me that the hotel is fully booked. The manager, an older woman, came and also insisted that they re fully booked. Checked booking sites on the web, and saw many available rooms similar to mine .... When I showed the ""ladies"" that many similar rooms are available... They changed their versions and told me they can arrange another room free.Told them thank you and I don't appreciate gifts from liars.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"In the heart of the old Nicosia in front of the old fence of the city, the former holiday inn hotel know known as the Nicosia City Center, you can stay with advantages and live with the disadvantages of you can, while eventually it's not bad compared to the prices too.Advantages:1) down town nearest point to many attractions, Famous Ledra area where all shopping brands are there, boarder line to the Turkish side of Cyprus;2) opposite to the bus stop, where you can go to many attractions as Cyprus mall, Jumpo mart (typical to Carrefour), IKEA, Marks & Spencer, Larnaca to enjoy the beach.3) near the famous shopping street (Makarus)4) many coffees around.5) prices are moderate.Disadvantages1) noise from the bus stop starts at 5 am, windows are not sound isolated.2) the building and amenities are too old and extremely exhausted, WCs, doors, towels one of the elevators was halted for a whole week.3) reception staff is not friendly at all!!? While the main dinning room staff are.4) Internet are free for two devices only!!5) room service is extremely poor, for a whole week stained sheets are not changed neither the wooden floors were cleaned.Enjoy.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
50,This place is not a Holiday Inn anymore. It has changed its name. I stayed one night and liked the place. Ledra Street is a short walk. There is a bus station in front of the hotel and one can travel to other places in Cyprus. The area around the hotel has a lot of bars and restaurants. It is constantly bus through the day. The hotel itself it not bad. My room was perfect for me. It has a balcony and nice to sit out in the morning. The front office staff were cordial and helpful. I tried the breakfast and it was standard hotel food. Did the job. I would stay in this hotel if I visit Nicosia again.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"This was definately a terrible experience. For a four star hotel am very dissapointed. Only the friendly personnel kept this hotel at any reasonable standard.Where to start:- rooms of very good size and with nice floor but positives end there- bathroom needed refurbishment and cleaning- very noisy rooms not only because of the bus station but also because of really bad sound isolation. I stayed in other hotels on the same street and never had the noise problems we had here. We asked to change but apparently there were no big rooms at the back. So nothing was done.- to add to this the bathroom started getting filled with ants. Ok I know that Cyprus has a lot but it shows the bad state of the building.- swimming pool and lockers in dissarray. A great asset was the indoor swimming pool which was lukewarm but still reasonably heated. But the whole area needed serious refurbishment. When in the swimming pool I saw something on the side which I thought was a cleaning device. In fact one of the lamps inside the swimming pool had come out and it was left on the side of the pool with its wire still going into the pool. The lockers did not lock mechanisms but the locks were drilled out and replaced by hooks to which you needed to attach a lock that you would get from the health desk office. Whoever thought that this would be ok for tourists to see needs to be fired!- breakfast was reasonable,though the coffee was undrinkable- parking they had a tiny space shared with another hotel that fitted 10 cars and a big container bin. It was free but almost always full. But there was parking space in front of the hotel and a big public parking opposite the hotel for five euros a night.- position was really good for those who wanted to visit Nicosia.I have known this hotel since many years and it is a real shame to see it in such a mess.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"The room overlooked the city centre Bus Station which was bit noisy but it didn't disturb my sleep. The bathroom could do with a refresh but it was adequate.Breakfast was well stocked with a full variety of local, continental and 'full' items. I found the tomatoes and cucumbers a little dry - maybe I should get up for an earlier breakfast.Great facilities, saunas, pool, friendly bar with frozen beer glasses...",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,Location is great. It is an easy walk to the old town and to the border with Turkey. It is easy to find and there is ample parking right across the street. Rooms however are very tired and the hotel really has nothing going for it. Breakfast is adequate .,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,Very tired hotel. Major renovations are needed. Rooms are large but very basic.Staff are friendly.눇Great location. Easy walk to the old town and the 'green line'. Easy to find and there is parking just across the street.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Very helpful and friendly staff: certainly at the reception desk, where they helped us with transport, printing of flight boarding passes and any possible questions.Hotel is cleary not new and has had his best years behind it. It needs a serious facelift (furniture, better soundproffing, better airconditioning,...).Although it is in average acceptable.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"Spent four days at this hotel, which USED to be a Holiday Inn, but now is unassociated with that chain and simply called the City Center Hotel. As an IHG member, I used to stay at this hotel when it was part of IHG, and decided it was worth going back to. The location is just too good to pass up. It is about two blocks from Ledras St, perhaps the liveliest street on the whole island. There are many good bars and restaurants within a short walk from this hotel and the bus terminal is right across the street. It is a 50 euro taxi fare from the LCA airport, but presumably you can take a bus, which would drop you off right across the street. The hotel itself is a little aged, but I asked for one of the rooms that Holiday Inn used to give me as an elite member of their club, and it was totally up to standards. The indoor pool downstairs is large. The gym next door is small but adequate. You must pay for wifi, but I found that if you purchase a 24 hour plan, and log out each time you are done, the 24 hours could last a week or longer, so get the cheapest plan possible. All in all, a great location and great value for the money.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Here’s the review for the Nicosia City Centre hotel based on our 9B criteria. I believe this hotel has recently lost its Holiday Inn status, and is now known as just the City Centre hotel. At first, it seems like a regular business hotel, but the problems soon become visible. This place needs the owners to urgently invest in the communal areas, or observe its decline.* Bed – good size and comfy.* Bedroom – also a good size.* Bathroom – fine.* Breakfast – cheap and cheerful, local cereals, basic fruit and cooked options. This is when it became clear that almost nobody was staying here.* Bar – small area in the lobby which is fine for a quick drink. The rooftop bar is advertised as a trendy city nightspot but was an empty and forlorn place.* Bods – trying their best to put on a brave face.* Budget – ok* Back (i.e. would we return?) – No. Investment has clearly been lacking and it shows. If you go to the health centre in the basement, it was once an active area but now the glass cases are empty and the Flintstones grotto looks dusty and decrepit. A themed restaurant looks like it might be permanently closed.* Beyond the hotel – it is downtown and less than 5 mins walk from the pedestrianised centre with shops and bars. The curious can also ponder at the border checkpoint in Europe's only divided capital.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"Stayed for a night in room 106 with my partner. They charge an awful lot of money for what they offer. There was an old TV which had only two channels and the hair drier was very old too. There was also only one pair of slippers. The worst was that they charge 10€ a day for wifi access in the rooms. I live locally so that was not a big of an issue but as a frequent traveller I cannot understand how a hotel charging 80€ a night (off season) is charging for wifi in the heart of Nicosia. Nowadays, wifi is a necessity for people travelling for business, tourism etc. This is simply a ripoff. Not to mention the limited free parking that is on-offer. We had to pay €5/24hrs for the parking opposite the hotel.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
50,"Stay here for one night, had a superior room 611, very nice.I changed as I have a fear of heights, room 401 is also good with three beds.Costa on reception and bar staff very good.Ideal location for national buses and tours and border crossing.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"Very central and convenient location, The hotel does not belongs to the Holiday Inn hotels. Most of the rooms are spacious and the prices are quite reasonable and the hotel it's nice. Howeveer, some of the rooms need a renovation. The breakfast it's OK.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"This hotel was previously a Holiday Inn property but has recently changed ownership.The Rooms are basic and certainly need a significant refurbish to bring them up to reasonable standards. Aside from the flat screen TV in my room, the fixtures & fittings were from the 90's. Location is convenient for walks around the old city. Free internet only in the lobby - have to pay per device in your room.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"I had chosen this hotel for its location adjacent the old city,but I discover that this was its only advantage.Rooms are partially renovated,if someone can say that when from the old tubes insects come all times...But if you open some doors you will discover part of the hotel ( stairs,walls etc) that are the same at least 50 years...Stay two nights and run away.....",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,The hotel is no longer a Holiday Inn. The rooms are spacious and fine but basic. During the stay there were very few guests in the hotel. It was fine because the sauna and pool were quite private. Breakfast is ok. Location of this hotel is very good if you want to see the city centre. All is within walking distance but there is no noise near the hotel. The central bus station is right in front.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"I visited Holiday Inn when I came to Cyprus for a business and wedding trip.The hotel was nice, I think I expected more from Holiday Inn but that's fine.I didn't have breakfast or dinner so can't comment on the food. The room was cozy and good.It's located in Central Nicosia so if you are there for business it's great.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,This Hotel is in a great location to explore Nicosia but best of all was the friendliness and helpfulness of Constantino Hartinuzzi. He was really knowledgeable about the places of interest and could give good clear directions about how to get to places. He is a real asset because of his manner and willingness to ensure that you would enjoy the your visit to this city.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"We arrived at noon and were checked in without any problems. The staff at the counter were somewhat uninterested and bored, but correct. The interior of the hotel was surprisingly poor for a Holiday Inn brand. The hallway carpets had lots of stains. The room, the best way to describe, was ""tired"", definitely ready for an update. Clearly this hotel belongs to another era, and has seen lots of use. We had the feeling that the owners are trying to squeeze out every cent before the upcoming demolition could proceed.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"I stayed here for one night, as my preferred hotel, the Classic Hotel less than a block away, was booked for the final night of my stay in Nicosia.The Holiday Inn City Centre is in a good location and is certainly acceptable. But I find it is not competitively priced, with its rate 20% higher than the Classic, which provides an excellent breakfast as part of their rate (which the Holiday Inn does not do).The Holiday Inn is more grand, with a large lobby. The Classic is more 'boutique' style, made up of a number of old houses cobbled together with half staircases leading up and down. Incredibly charming in my view,The Holiday Inn is, well, a Holiday Inn. It is predictable and as expected. Some will prefer that and the rate, at €108 incl. VAT, is not overly expensive.It was unexpected that they added a fee for telephone calls though, which I have otherwise not encountered in Cyprus.Two other 'nit-picks': the towels were a bit threadbare and I really don't like fixed liquid soap dispensers in the bathroom instead of individual amenities. I am sure it saves the hotel some money, but it feels a bit too Motel 6 like to me. Not keeping with the image International Hotels Group would prefer to project I would think.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Arrived, admittedly earlier than normal check-in but rooms were ready, OK so far. Got to room key card didn't work, back to reception & await maintenance man. Got us in room not made up, contact reception. 30 minutes later into room, no tea, milk or coffee in holder, contact reception. 10 minutes & housekeeping arrive with two sticks of coffee & two tea bags plus a few sticks of sugar. Towels smelled musty , no aircon .Bearing in mind we had executive rooms which were OK, made the experience worse.No hotel information at all in the rooms.50cl Water in minibar 2.50 euros, went to shop next door 0.75 cents for 1.5 litres & some milk.Asked reception if roof top bar was open they said it was, went up to 7th floor & bar closed, outside seats dirty,Stayed here a couple of years ago & it was OK , this time disappointing.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,Wow. Hard to believe that Holiday Inn lets them keep the flag with the property this tired and dirty. Carpets everywhere are full of stains. My Executive Room small window looks out on a back alley and an abandoned building.Poor TV channel choice with interference on many and a tiny TV. Towels are all grey. Bathroom floor and tub are grungy. One power outlet at the desk. Marginal Internet. I had hoped to find an alternative to the overpriced Hilton but this is not it!,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
50,"I flied from Amman and stayed at this hotel for one night. This hotel is located at the border of old city and new city of the city center. The room (No. 607) is comfortable and faced to south (new city view). It is very convenient to walk old town and new town. And I also entered to Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. On the next day, I had to leave to the airport around 7.00 am. Breakfast is normally served from 6.30, but I asked to take at 6.00 and they agreed. Thus I could keep my pace to eat slowly. I thank all hotel people for their warm hospitality (omotenashi in Japanese).",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"Lovely hotel right in the middle of Nicosia, only few minutes walk to the old town. Rooms very spacious and clean. Breakfast was ok, cereal, continental and English breakfasts, good selection. No parking at the hotel, but there is a large car park opposite, that only charged €5 for 24 hours. Dined in the rooftop restaurant, view of car park interesting, but amazing food, highly recommended.We did take our own towels as we had seen a Previous comment, plus when we went to the pool, we were asked to use the room towels as they didn't have any.Does have free Internet in lobby, but if you join their 'club' you get free Internet in your room.Bus station is right opposite as well.Pool was quite cold, steam room, bit musty, not very good. We did have a lovely stay. However slightly spoilt, when our children who were just playing in the pool, were told to be quiet as they had an external auction in the hotel. Bearing in mind we had paid to stay there and only been in the pool less then 30 minutes and was 9.30am.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"After booking the hotel we were worried reading some of the other reviews! We needn't have been our experience was very good., Friendly staff on reception greeted us, we went to the first floor to our executive room, that for a city centre hotel was huge, modern wooden floor, two comfortable double beds, plus table and chairs. Very clean, bathrobes in the bathroom, complimentary water and sparkling, iron and board. Toiletries in the bathroom, plenty of hot water.Staying away many times I fail to see why anyone would complain. The staff on the first floor roof terrace bar were excellent ( this needs refurb but may well be planned before the season).The pool was great for the kids.Breakfast was well stocked and hot and again staff very good. The location is perfect for Ledra street and I would happily stay again.Our friends had a standard rom on the 4th floor that was also great, clean and spacious!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"I have stayed here before in 2012 and it was a nice hotel and I liked the corporate consistency you got with Holiday Inn - no longer.This is a dated hotel and my room was frankly a disgrace. The CRT TV was the largest thing in the room, bed was uncomfortable (again twin beds - STOP IT, offer doubles). Where are the plug points to charge things?Bathroom is old and dated. Hotel itself is actually well situated and a very short walk to the centre and the local restaurants.Staff couldn't have been more indifferent to my arrival if they tried although the WiFi code was offered without my asking (which these days is a miracle).",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"I'd like to start by saying that we are not particularly discerning travellers and have stopped in a range of hotels all over the world. We have had luxury in Beijing and a flea pit on Flores Island Indonesia and everything in between. I'd also like to paint you the full picture of our stay here. We had originally booked to stay for 2 nights at another hotel in Nicosia that when we arrived at it and checked in found that it was too far out from the city centre. The time was around 14.00. We negotiated with a very accommodating manager to immediately check out at a small cost. This, he said, would cover charges made to him by a famous and large hotel reservation website. Whilst not 100% happy we agreed and left heading for the centre of the old town. The first hotel we spotted was quickly followed by another and then, there it was, our saviour The Holiday Inn. As a 'brand' we have always been comfortable here stopping in the HI Express in our home city on our regular visits there. Time was now pressing on and we wanted to get checked in somewhere and get out sight seeing. I was offered a room in either this hotel or the 'sister' hotel next door. I called in to the next door hotel and was shown a reasonable room but decided to go with the brand at slightly more money but with facilities. We checked in. Wi-fi is free in the lobby but €16 per day in the room unlesss you are a member of the HI reward scheme! Should be free everywhere to everyone?? So here goes......we walked over to the one working lift, I think someone else mentions only one lift working in another review some time ago?? Have they fixed it or not? I've no doubt we'll find out in The Front Office Managers response to this. (She couldn't be bothered to come and discuss my complaint face to face electing to speak only over the phone). Lift is ok, clean enough. We then step out into a sight on floor 6........the carpet is disgusting it looks like it has never been cleaned, certainly not hoovered recently. None of the rooms to the doors are painted, numbers stuck on them any old how. Enter the room to be met with a similar sight, carpet filthy, dust on furniture, finger prints on any glassware and worst of all stains on the bedding. Now, I agree that at this point we should have 'done one' but we elected to stay desperate to use our limited time in Nicosia to the best. Heating was working, bathroom filthy. Breakfast the next day cold. To sum up, the whole place is flithy, the management are obviously not doing anything about any of the complaints that have previously been made. A disgrace, a complete disgrace and I urge you to stay somewhere else in Nicosia. I will review the superb hotel we moved to. Should any of you wish to discuss our stay here then please get in touch, we feel cheated by the brand here and I will be taking this further on our return to the UK.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"DO NOT BOOK THERE!Kindly put, a DISGRACE to Cyprus and the Holiday Inn brand name.Here below you can find a list of disappointments from our recent stay there:• There was NO HEATING. I over heard that they ONLY turn the heating a FEW HOURS during the afternoon.• The air vent fans on the roof of the hotel are noisier than an aeroplane. Thus we could not sleep.• Only one elevator was working. There was NO sign on the second one whether it was out of order.• NO paper towels in the lobby toilets.• Bath towels where VERY OLD, like rags.• I will not comment on the buffet that was tasteless BUT I WILL comment on the quality of fruit available on the dessert table (BLACK bananas, soft oranges with insect wholes on them as well as not ripe mandarins, ONLY the apples where edible)• Mould on the corridor walls• Non-existent false ceiling in the corridor or even dirty from machine oil• NO cover on the emergency light in the corridorAll of these are not things you find at a 4 Star hotel, never say an approved hotel!Also note that I have complained to the reception 4 times for the heating and asked to have an explanation from the management, needless to say that NO one contacted me.I am a Cypriot and trust me this is NOT a typical Cyprus hotel.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"A bit more expensive then other Nicosia Hotels, but i would definitely choose again because of its location. The City Center is around the hotel, coffee shops, restaurants, bars and the bus station which is right across the street.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"We had all stayed in Holiday Inns before so when returning from Northern Cyprus through Nicosia we saw the hotel and thought that would do. What a mistake. Rude staff who had no interest in their work were in abundance. The rooms were tired, noisy and not cleaned or stocked properly. The bar had no draft beer although pumps were evident and prices were exorbitant. Breakfast was very average with three staff stood idle whilst plates piled up on the table. Wifi was very poor throughout the hotel. A disgrace to the brand.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"I am an IHG member and thus, fetch for a club brand wherever I go. I also consider myself average when it comes to negative comments, which I usually avoid! However, this hotel shocked Mea!This should not definitely be an IHG. We have stayed luckily 18 hours in this hotel my son and I! The receptionist was so ""rude"" almost answering on our questions which were only a couple.Although the room we stayed in is ""renovated"" it needs a lot of improvement... The phone was not functioning or almost... Where in the world, you should go to the front desk to pay and get a passcode for the internet!!! The smell of the room was not so pleasant (we had to get a refresher) ... The bathrooms are old and need refurbishment... The furniture were not very clean!for the price we are paying in Cyprus, it does not make sense.As for the positives, it is very near the down town and the main shops district. It also has a taxi and bus station just in front, which facilitates things.All over, it is a below average. Serious refurbishment should be considered.I personally will avoid it next time I am in nicosia.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Some staff didn't seem too bothered, some lovely. Room a bit shabby to be honest. Key didn't work in safe and despite telling the desk, nothing done. Lots of noise in street behind hotel.Breakfast is good - have seen less complimentary reviews and in my view it's fine, lots of choice. Left my jacket and it was posted on with grace and for free, which is much appreciated - would have expected to pay the postage. Thank you.Bottom line - relatively cheap and in a great position for Nicosia's interesting museums and other attractions (Greek and Turkish side). Not luxury but functional and went the extra mile returning my jacket. Thanks again.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"This hotel claims to be 4 star. Our experience in one of their restaurants was first class and deserved that acclaim but our room was closer to a very tired budget hotel than one where we had paid €140 for a night.The first warning was when our room number turned out to be a piece of laminated paper stuck to the wall and the door appeared to be unvarnished plywood. Room 124 was billed as a King Leisure room and did boast a big bed in an otherwise basic room.Faults included, a bent chair, poor wiring to the TV, scuffed walls, mildew on the bed valence, a cracked basin in the bathroom and a crooked loo roll holder. The towels were thin, grey, frayed and one had a big hole in it. OK in a cheap place but 4 star? The bed was hard but we did have lovely pillows.We did look for stairs to walk down one level and there was an indicated door virtually opposite the room. It must have been a fire exit based on it being filithy and the old coffee stuck on a step.The hotel boasts several retaurants but only the Marco Polo was open on our visit.The Marco Polo made our visit. The italian style food was simply excellent. The service matched. We would definately eat here again.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"While not terrible, this hotel fell way short of our expectations. On arrival, the front desk staff and concierge were sullen. The interior was dark, dingy, and worn out. The room was adequate in size, but the tub/shower was very narrow, and the street below was noisy - the walls and windows were thin. The room, moreover, wasn't decorated at all. The skirt around the bed was dirty. There weren't many TV channels to choose from. The fitness center and pool area, likewise, were dark and dirty. The equipment in the fitness center was old and poorly maintained. Breakfast was included in the room rate, and it was probably the best thing about the hotel, with the exception of the scrambled eggs, which might have been powdered. The selection was fairly limited, however, and it was exactly the same every day; so over a long stay it became monotonous. Lastly, there were wedding receptions at the hotel both weekends we were there, they went until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and the music and fun could be heard in every room, which was aggravating. We would not stay here again.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"Having stayed at this hotel on many occasions which in the past have always been very satisfactory. On this occasion awful. Arrived at reception, the receptionist was on the phone, did not bother to look up make some kind of acknowledgement that we were there. When she finished her call, no welcome of any description, very surly unhelpful. No details i.e. times of breakfast or where you go, sorted out the key and that was that. When we went to our room which was an Executive Room, looked alright. The towels in the bathroom were so old they were thin and grey, the air conditioning was very noisy could not have it on for too long. When my husband went to till the kettle to make a drink, well it was disgusting inside there was something black and half a kettle of black water. My husband called reception, they sent up a maid who spoke no English, he somehow managed to say we wanted another kettle not that one back. A few minutes later she came back with another kettle which did not fit the stand, so no hot drink. Not worth making any more fuss at that point. In the morning we complained to someone who could understand and he sorted it out. The breakfast was so disappointing that we only bothered with it one morning for the rest of our stay we went out for breakfast. An Executive Room I do not think so. The hotel really needs lots of improvements as a City Centre hotel it is not what one expects.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"On a day trip to Nicosia we made the mistake of ordering coffee in the hotel lobby. At 11.00 on a sunday morning it took a while to find a barman, it then took him 10 minutes to walk the 10m to our table. After another 10 minutes we were served very small coffees and cappuccinos which were OK but priced at 4.45 euros each ! Venice is cheaper !",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"The hotel entrance is quite impressive and the room size okay, but that's about it. Surly receptionist, TV not working and had to be replaced, aircon not working and had to be repaired and then it was really noisy, lots of marks and cracks, hardly any water coming out of the shower, phone in room not working properly and, worst of all, a €10 charge to use the wifi, to add to the general poor value for money that this hotel offers! I really hate that rip-off charge and wonder when hotels that still do this will enter the 21st century. Suffice it to say, I definitely won't be back.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"I chose the hotel because of its location, and, to be honest, because I recently became a member of the IHG Rewards club, so I decided to stay here instead of the one I usually frequent on my trips to Nicosia, which is half a block away. It was not a very positive experience. Though the location is central, the rooftop restaurant/bar is nice, and the staff tried their best to be accommodating, the hotel itself is in dire need of renovations. The first room they put me in was in good shape, renovated, but the ceiling started leaking in the middle of the night ( faulty AC unit upstairs, I was told. It happens). The ""suite"" they upgraded me to in the middle of the night, after the leak, was right out of the 80's, dark, dated and not at all acceptable. I refused the upgrade. They put me temporarily in a tiny (updated) room with no view, until the following day, when more rooms would be available. The following day I had to leave my luggage at the front desk, until they found a room. When I returned in the afternoon, I was assigned to a room on a high floor, good views, but the room itself was not renovated, had old carpeting, and the bathroom was dark ( only 2 down lights, above the sink, one burned. I called the front desk and it was immediately changed, but by that time I was exhausted from the ordeal. Won't be staying there again anytime soon, unless I know the rooms have been renovated!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"We were transferred to this hotel as the original one we had booked was closed. We have stayed at this hotel before and were not impressed then. Room size was good, bathroom needs updating and sealant around the bath needs changing. Air con not very effective. We had a leak under the sink, handy man unable to fix so we had to move rooms. Room allocated was smaller than the original and bathroom smaller. Cracked electric socket in room. Breakfast was probably the worst we have ever had. Beans and mushrooms stone cold. Fried eggs were steaming so overcooked. The room was extrememly hot and waitress said she had reported it before but nobody had come out to see it. No leisure facilities aviable due to the holiday. Would not stay there again.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"we stayed for 2 days at this hotel and we were very pleased,the staff was very helpfull,the room was big with great matress for sleep and clean.The breakfast was good but it could have been better.close to the main shopping area.would deffinetly go again!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"Stayed at this hotel part of a short business trip, not pleasant at all, rooms are not maintained and look very old, they are not very well cleaned and you feel you are in a barely 1 star hotel.Breakfast is fair though and staff are helpful. Hotel is near the main streets of Nicosia if you want to do some shopping.Had a room facing the backyard and it was terrible, luckily staff changed it for one facing the street.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"Simple Do not go ! It dies not worth a penny of the money that a night stay costs. I wend for several business trips. It is very dirty, some rooms are thirty years old, the staff is unprofessionals and not polite... Only a lady at the bar is polite and professional... The receptionists are awful.My only advice... Do not go to this hotel.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"Stayed here on a work trip. The hotel location is excellent for Nicosia - just outside the city walls and close to the old town, which is full of great bars and restaurants... However, the service is terrible, rooms are average, breakfast is fairly poor and the function room upstairs means that you could end up with thumping music going until 4am!!! Even if you're not travelling... This is FAR from ideal. Really can't recommend this place...",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"I stayed at this hotel in 2005 and believe me it seems that nothign has been done to the hotel since. The rooms are extremeley dated, only one lift ever works (and it must be the slowest lift in the world), this is not good in the sweltering corridor that has no air conditioning. So waiting in the corridor with a shirt and tie on was not much fun.The bathrooms are extremely small and ever so dated. They could do with a lick of paint and/or some new tiling.Didn't find the receptionists particularly warm or polite either.Overall, not my best stays, I will certainly not be booking into an Holiday Inn next time I am in Nicossia.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"We needed to overnight in Nicosia close to the centre, so this was an obvious choice. The Receptionist at Check In was really nice, friendly helpful and quick. I noticed that one lift was out of service, as I went to my room. I noticed on leaving the lift that opposite my room was a 'Housekeeping' Station and that there were two chambermaids 'chatting' in a language other thsan Greek who seemed completely oblivious to my presence. I didn't realise the implication of this until later. I tried to find lunch and only the formal restaurant on the roof seemed to be functioning and since it had a large group table, I decided that a quick lunch was unlikely, so went into nearby Ledra Street and found a nice place that was clean and served traditional home made Cypriot recipes. (I'm going there again). I returned to the hotel and noticed that the Reception Staff had changed and asked for some Ice. this was bought speedily to my room by a rather scruffily dressed person who was a bit gruff- the message being 'You disturb me in the middle of the afternoon to bring you some ice - I'm just the cleaner you know!'. We returned to the hotel near midnight and the same lift was still out of service.When it had been busy earlier we had to wait quite a long time for the lift.At around 07.00 someone came into our room unannounced and left without any apology or explanation, then the ringtones began and the chatter (from the Chambermaids Morning Meeting and Information Exchange). We could not get back to sleep since it continued for about 30 minutes. Breakfast began by a Waiteress shouting from the middle of the Dining room for our room number and then demanding 'I must have it'. No 'Kalimera' We don;t usually shout across a hotel dining room ourselves and had no intention of starting now, nor broadcasting that we were no longer in a certain room. We were late to breakfast in that it was a little after 0900. Most of what was on offer had gone and only small pieces were left, if at all. there was some ;Grilled Bacon' dripping with water, so obviously boiled, two small cut pieces of tomato, a spoonful of congealed scrambled egg and one piece of cake that looked a bit stale. I decided that toast might just do, at least it would absorb the diluted nuclear yellow orange juice. The Waitress was by now reading a magazine and there was a waiter on the scene who began to attend to a few of the used tables. It really wasn't great. Check out was quick, the 'Morning Receptionist' had returned but the lift was still out of service. To be honest our room, that was supposed to be 'Executive', was jaded. The washbasin plug didn't work very well and all was a bit run down and had clearly seen better days and the TV had a problem, the picture kept shrinking. The Aircon was quite noisy. Parking was limited but there was a pay to park car park across the street. with three bags it was a bit inconvenient to unload, if you couldn't get a space in the lay-by in front of the hotel. In the morning a tourist rent car was parked parallel to the kerb and blocked about four spaces. when I asked the hotel about Cards for windscreens indicating 'Hotel Guest' and getting dispensation from the 30 minute limit, they looked at me as if I was from Mars. I really did not feel as if I was in a Holiday Inn. Apart from the Morning Receptionist, you felt that the staff would rather be somewhere else and their training levels seemed low and unprofessional and probably there were not enough of them in the right place at the right times. I really don't think that we shall rush to stay again and would not recommend anyone else to.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband and also treated my sister-in-law and her husband who live in Paphos. We looked at the hotel on-line and liked the fact that it had the roof top restaurant and bar. There was also a swimming pool. The executive rooms looked lovely and modern with air conditioning. We were all looking forward to our night away. Unfortunately it did not live up to the website!!! Some of the lights in our room did not work although some were fixed. The air conditioning did not work and could not be fixed (the maintenance Man was very nice and apologised, but who wants a maintenance man in your room for half an hour). The receptionists were not concerned or apologetic and a smile would not have gone amiss! We went up to the roof top bar as it was a lovely sunny day. There was no bar just concrete and mess. We went to see the swimming pool but it shut at 4pm (you can't check in until 2pm so if you want a swim you will have to be quick!). We had a drink at the bar in reception area, the waitress that served us was lovely and friendly which was a welcome change from the two grumpy receptionists. We were kept awake until 3.30am by a wedding party that was right underneath our rooms no one let us know that this would be taking place. The furniture was stained in our rooms and I really don't think this is acceptable when you pay top end prices. The waiter at breakfast was lovely and friendly and went out of his way to find some tomato ketchup. Unfortunately we had finished our breakfast by the time he came back with one little sachet, but we appreciated his efforts. All in all it was such a disappointment and we will not be returning. The website should be updated to let people know what they are letting themselves in for.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"It is a dated hotel and needs some TLC. The ceilings in the Ballroom / Meeting room and All Day Dining should be replaced.The areas I visited have been clean, bathroom spotless!I have been there off season and the hotel was empty. The Breakfast was actually the only negative point, no effort made there.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Not wonderful but definitely okay. The hotel was clean, the food in the march polo restaurant was very good. The staff were quite helpful. The worst thing was the air conditioning which failed to make the room better than too warm even in April.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Nicosia isn't really a tourist hotspot, but the Hotel is perfectly adequate. Slightly dated, and a little noisy for the rooms that overlook the front where the bus station and car park are. But has lots of amenities and in a good location. Rooftop bar has a great view across the city.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"Not the worst hotel in the world but its certainly no where near the best and i think Holiday inn should consider removing it from there brand. It is close to the town centre, about a 5 minute walk to the main street for shops bars & restaurants.The breakfast was poor to the point i stopped eating there after 2 days. The sushi bar wasn't open at all throughout my stay.The room was quite spacious with a view over the bus station which got quite noisy from about 6am. there was a small portable TV from the 80's, the news channel was in English. There was tea/coffee provided in the room but no kettle.The pool area was very nice but is let down by the rest of the spa which needs a decent clean and a lick of paint.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

Very friendly welcome at book in, recognised as a gold elite member & given a complimentary room upgrade, offered helpful advice on tourist sites to visit whilst in town.The restaurant on the top floor has superb views of the whole city, exceptional service (thank you Plame) & great food.Would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Nicosia Cyprus and my wife and I hope to be able to return in the future!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"We have stayed in a hotel last weekend and have chosen it only because we are the members of the Hotel Group.Very old, shabby hotel; rooms are very average, but did not disgust so much, as gym and pool (see the photos attached).We have been informed, that restaurant is under renovation, but why not the rooms, I am asking now?Charge of Eur 110 per night (without breakfast!) is way too much for such a rubbish during a Low Season!Note to STAFF:Over a year, you have been receiving the negative feedback and it looks like nothing has been done. Sorry, but polite, neutral responses to our negative reviews, will not help anymore. At least charge 2-3 times less, then people will not expect much.How many case Managers do you have or is it such a high staff turnover?May be some rooms have been renovated, but do NOT GIVE other rooms, whose are not renovated. Renovate the gym, pool area, closed massage rooms, Flintstone bar, ect. It is quite a big area, and pity it is in so crappy condition!P.S: Believe me, you don’t have the second chance, if you don’t make it up to a client at his first stay!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"We had a large room with 2 queen size beds, so one for each of us. Room was basic with no wifi. Bathroom was down steps, no good as I am in a wheelchair. Did request disabled room but non available. Main complaint is he drop Kerb outside the hotel is always blocked by parked cars, the manager being the worst culprit!! It really needs a sign or failing that a cone. It really spoilt my stay having to negotiate the high Kerb. Did complain so will be interested if they have done anything to improve this. Being Cyprus nothing will get done. DO NOT STAY IF DISABLED!!!!!!!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"Stayed for 4 nights, and will not choose this hotel again. I had a room on the sixth floor at the back, which was quiet on terms of road noise, but directly underneath Nicosia's secret elephant zoo given the noise on the floor above. Room was dusty, services poorly designed, cold and with absolutely no redeeming features. Large bathroom, but thin scratchy towels; plug that didn't keep the water in the sink (ironic, given the sticker on the mirror shouting at you to save water) and it took over 5 mins for any 'hot' water to run through. The iron is permanently plugged into the inside of the wardrobe. Breakfast was tragic, as was the expression and demeanour of the man who was working in the restaurant. I can honestly think of nothing positive to say about the whole stay.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"The advantages of this hotel are mainly its location (really close to the historical Nicosia city centre), and the very good level of service. We were always welcomed with a smile and we faced staff eager to serve and help in the best possible way.On the other hand, the hotel certainly needs renovation. The half of the rooms are really old, while the other half are very recently renovated.In regards to the breakfast, this was a bit of dissapointment - according to Holiday Inn standards.General conclusion, for a 1-2 days trip and for rate up to 70 euros, it worths its money.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"This is the worst hotel in Nicosia and Holiday Inn should seriously consider removing it from its network.Firstly I had booked via telephone, and when asked if I could be sent a confirmation of some sort they where very rude and could not provide me with one. Our first room was disgustingly smelling of smoke (and we had requested a non-smoking room) and when we opened the cupboard we where shocked. It was disgusting, the wood was dirty from the fungus and structurally destroyed. Look at the picture I attachedWe had enough and requested to change room. We where sent to another floor which many more problems occurred. There was nearly NO water running through the shower, only a few drops.The room was very dirty and forget about parking.

I went to get a latte coffee from the machine but all I got was black coffee. very politely I told the waiter about it and he just looked at me and said is nothing he could do. I was astonished at his reply, that a 4 star hotel could not provide milk for coffees. He answered that if it was only me he could bring me a latte from the bar area. Carried on to get some breakfast and it was hardly anything left. What little was there was dried and not eatable. All the guests that arrived for breakfast after us, about 12, had exactly the same bad service.It is a great shame that after we all had a wonderful time in the hotel the night before, all was spoiled by the bad service at breakfast time. I have traveled and stayed in many hotels 4 stars and 5 stars but I have never experienced service or breakfast to be so bad.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

I haven't really slept for three nights.- the interieur is old and does need a refreshment very very soon.- the breakfast has a lot to choose from but the quality of the products is not really good.- the staff is helpful, but seems the be overstrained from time to time.- the sofa and the swivel chair were not clean.- the price with EUR 140 is far too high for the quality you get.

In addition, the breakfast was very rich with delicious dishes for all tastesThe room was spacious and confortable and with a nice view from the balcony but it was old fashioned decorated.

There is also a mini market next to the hotel, which is a plus, anyway.At the front desk, everyone we met was kind and helpful, they even served us drinks, late at night, after a wonderful wedding reception we had over there.The food is excellent, and the breakfast buffet was full and had almost anything one could ask for. Eggs, bacon, sausages, grilled cheese, fresh yogurt etc.I only missed a good cup of strong coffee in the morning.They had a machine preparing beverages instead, which did not satisfy me 100%.As to the rooms they were recently renovated, the bathroom as well. The linen and pillows were perfect. My only remark, as other reviewers agree, would be about the corridors. They need a renovation indeed.Other visitors from our group, had a leaking problem on the sixth floor, but they were kindly offered a room upgrade.

10,"I had to be in Nicosia for four days on a business trip, and thought that since the Holiday Inn is in the city centre and is a recognised brand, that it would be a decent choice of hotel.When I arrived, it was 25 degrees outside and I was glad to be getting indoors where I assumed it would be cooler... It wasn't... There seemed to be no air conditioning in the lobby, which surprised me, but I just thought that I'd get up to my room as quick as I could where it would be cooler.In general, the lobby looked quite nice, but there were signs that the hotel was really skimping on the spending like peeling paint and stained ceilings, not something I would have expected in a 4* hotel.I asked the concierge guy where the car park was and he told me 'there's a pay and display car park across the road'... (Bear in mind that if you are on holiday and don't fancy being awake early enough to be across the road paying for parking every morning at 9 am, this is not the hotel for you).When I finally got away from the unfriendly guy at reception trying to sell me breakfast at 5pm, I walked over to the pair of lifts. One wasn't working, and remained that way for my entire stay. (I ended up using the stairs after the first day, because I was waiting around so much).Anyway, I got into the ancient lift to go up to the second floor. The lift is tiny and very very slow. When I stepped out of the lift I thought it must have been a time machine, the carpet on the upstairs floors looks like it's been there since the 70s.When I got into the room it was dark and extremely hot, I quickly looked around for the light switches and air conditioning. When I turned the air conditioning on, it just started blowing out room temperature air. I phoned down to reception to ask why, and they said it was because the central air conditioning and heating had not been turned on yet, and the best they could offer was a portable fan. When they brought the fan up I tried to set it up I front of the window, so at least it would be blowing some fresh air into the room, but none of the sockets anywhere near the window worked, so it just ended up blowing hot air around.The room itself was pretty nice, aside from some dated furniture. The fridge was tiny and not very cold. The safe was ancient and quite loose, so not very confidence inspiring... The TV didn't work properly, and the shower had no power at all - the water virtually fell out of the antique shower head. The fact that the shower had so little power, meant you had to stand right underneath it, in the plug hole, not very comfortable. The bath was cramped too.The bedding was ripped in at least two places.The swimming pool is a lot small than it looks in the pictures and doesn't seem like a guest pool, it's just full of creepy pensioners who just come to the hotel to sit in the pool and stare at people.All in all, the worst hotel I've ever been to.Would never consider going back.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

However the sheets and towels were clean and water hot.Breakfast buffet was mixed with not very nice scrambled eggs but reasonable coffee from a machine. It would have helped to have someone check that food was not running out as both mornings ourselves and other guests had to ask for fried eggs, bacon and bread.

I called room service and they sent a bellboy to give me keys to a new room, since it was 10:30 p.m. and no one was available to change bed sheets.So, I was secondly placed in room 158, where I also found HAIR in the bed. I called again and this time the manager came upstairs to see for herself, and she saw it: various lengths and shapes of hair. She told me it was from the laundry. And again I was led to a new room: 153.The manager and I inspected the bed sheets and this time there was no hair. However, as she was leaving I noticed that the bathroom was noisy. Apparently the toilet was leaking. Again, they couldn't send anyone to fix it because it was now 11 p.m.For breakfast, even though, it is mentioned in the menu that breakfast is served until 10:15 a.m., the waiters started packing the buffet at 10:05, without giving notice to any of the guests!

30,"Stayed for three nights in September 2012 on business. Room 612. Overall impression is a functional 3 star hotel which meets the technical requirements for a 4 star.Room was large, with sofa and desk. Window in corner of room overlooked the city towards the Turkish-occupied side of Nicosia. You have to squeeze along the sofa to look out. Bed was double but too short for a six footer (186cm). Was firm with variety of hard/soft pillows. Reading lights OK. Bathroom was clean, although the loo seat was a little loose. Limited range and quality of toiletries. Overall decor was clean but dated and looked ""cheap"" as did the corridors and lifts.A major problem: the water pressure was very low, poor shower head. And it takes ages for the water to warm up. I can quite understand other reviewers claiming no hot water: you have to wait and wait. This happened on all three days (and to my colleagues). Sorry but the provision of hot water with good pressure is a basic requirement in a hotel. TV was flat screen on the wall with a good selection of local, regional and international channels.Breakfast is standard. But this is a four star hotel and breakfasts should not be standard but something to remember positively. A routine Bed and Breakfast would provide this level of food. Limited newspapers on offer: again not to 4 star standard.You have to pay for wi-fi in the room. EURs16 for 48 hours or EUR10 a day. This is no longer acceptable in hotels: the internet is no longer a luxury or something exceptional. Charging is simply a rip-off and gives a poor impression. again especially at a 4 star hotel.The reception staff were friendly and helpful. They allowed me to use their PC to print my boarding card: again this is now a standard and hotels should provide a free PC/printer facility.Didn't try the restaurants: there are so many good ones in walking distance. Nor the basement spa.I note that the management are good at replying to trip advisor comments. A plus point. What I would like to see is a commitment to change. Overall impression is that Holiday Inn seems to be a franchise chain which is resting on its past laurels and not re-investing anywhere near enough to keep up with modern standards for 4 star hotels. Quick profits now rather than longer term sustainability.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,Avoid if you can! Check in where receptionist did not speak to me once. Bring sturdy shoes to walk on the carpets in the bedroom. Watch out for the fallen plaster in the corridors and if you suffer from migraines bring sunglasses to walk to the lifts - the carpets will have you in agony in secinds. Mini bar set at 30c . Air conditioning last seen in episode of Downton Abbey. Hot water seems to be available on Tuesday and Thursday morning only. Share this with reception and they will happily tell you that they know. Power erratic. Room service delivered in under an hour and a half ( shame it was not a salad because it was chilled to say the least). Phone did not work. Great night club on the roof and luckily you do not have to leave the discomfort of your room to enjoy the loud banging music! Felt more like a cheap and dated Youth hostel than the €800 hotel I had to (pre) pay for the week. I could bang on for ages. Just avoid if you can,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Staff needs some training to get to IHG standards. There was no hot water and all I got was a shrug... Then upon check out the lady said she ""gave"" me the internet connection for free as a compensation and that it would have been 10 euros otherwise... yeah right. Most Holiday Inn properties have free Wifi and 10 euros hardly makes up for not being able to have a shower at all unless you want to risk neumonia.Breakfast quality was barely acceptable.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"The Holiday Inn is in a good location but the service was awful. Receptionists couldn't be bothered giving any information, breakfast quality was poor and I sat in the bar area for 10mins without being served - even though the waitress walked past me. The hot water wasn't working in the hotel the first morning, and when I raised it with reception, there was no apology. It was working for my second morning but the shower gave out little more than a trickle of hot water. I won't be staying there again.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"For a quick business over-night stay, this hotel is fine. Near to the centre of Nicosia and within five minutes walking time of the border crossing should you wish to venture into the Turkish side of Nicosia.Decor within the hotel is very dated and the rooms also look like a make-over wouldn't go a miss! No flat screen tv's here!The IHG executive rooms are on the 1st floor. However it is very difficult to believe you are treated to anything other than the ordinary guests receive. View was.........well it wasn't; put it like that!!!The hotel holds party nights on the 7th floor (top floor). These can go on until the early hours of the morning (5am), I could here the noise from my 1st floor room : (Hotel bar is small too. On a brighter note, the breakfast was good!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"A typical city center business hotel - no one would ever choose it for it's service, friendliness or inspiriering interior design! But just to stay overnight - everything works!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"The room at the hotel was fine, but it just seemed as though various little things didn't work. You have to pay for internet and it is unreliable, cutting off often. My phone couldn't make internal calls and when I called reception to complain the receptionist hardly spoke English. Others I reached also hardly spoke English. The receptionists aren't always at the desk, so people calling me at the hotel often weren't able to get through to my room. There were only two electrical outlets in the room, so I couldn't have my computer plugged in the same time as my laptop. Saturday night the rooftop club blasts bass-inflected music until all hours, which I heard two floors below. I am sure you can find better value for your money elsewhere.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

20,"I stayed here about 8 years ago and it was quite good. I booked this on the internet and got a good room rate, but I know the internet rates do not get you a nice room which proved the truth.I was first surprised by the reception, the staff were not very informative or interested to tell me about parking (there is a council pay-for-parking opp the hotel, behind the bus stops). The room was not bad, but the TV was a shocker, old tube type with long service meaning the colours were all washed out and the picture all distorted. More like an old black and white with a bad antenna. Also there was advertised free wifi in public areas, but this was limited to one hour only. Then you have to pay. However, I stayed only from late evening to early morning, to do one day business in Nicosia, then it was thankfully back to Larnaca to fly home.I like this part of Nicosia, and enjoy some of the restaurants in the area around the UN buffer zone.Next time I might try the Castle next door or Cleopatra, which is a short walk to the Green Line.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"I paid about £79 per night here and stayed 3 nights. I had to pay for WiFi every day which always annoys me. But I felt a little misled because I thought that the roof bar would be open for lunch outside but intact there was nowhere to sit outside other than my balconyI get so angry when the house keeping start banging on the door at 9am and this happened 2 mornings! The bar was expensive and so was room service, although the food was really nice and the lady in the cafe very helpful.Reception staff were stuffy and I don't think I would stay again because the whole place is in need of a re vamp and a little depressing.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

The waitress there was extremely kind and friendly.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"Downtown Nicosia is a somewhat run down place with fairly dodgy areas (especially in winter, and definitely at night), so when you have a chance, stay on the coast and visit Nicosia on a day trip. If you can't avoid it, this Holiday Inn is probably your best choice in the area as it's conveniently located at at the edge of the old town. Which doesnt mean it's a great choice though. The staff was helpful, the lobby looks nice & clean, breakfast is reasonable, but the rooms are seriously up for renovation. Poorly insulated, with dated furniture, worn out towels and a dampy old bathroom it's simply not worth the $150 per night. And oh, when you want to iron your shirts (I was here on business) they'll offer you a self-service: go 3 floors down, walk to the other end of the building where, in some remote alcove, you'll find a rusty old iron board and iron without water.It all may work out well in summer, with tourists spending most of their days out on the streets (not caring about ironing), but if this hotel wants to play a role in the off-season market & business segment they definitely should do better!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"I've been to Holiday Inn's around. Already tried many of them and others hotels from the same family or the same category, but like this one... Nope!This hotel needs a lot to be up to the standard, it's not acceptable.First of all the staff is very rude and unprofessional. Second, everything is broken in this building.Doors, sealing, floor, AC, elevators... That is not acceptable.I took pictures of everything but if this hotel doesn't close for renewal, it's gonna be disastrous.I want to add something here: what is it exactly with Cypriots? Everyone is sad in this city, everybody is preoccupied, elder people are fat and depressed, taxi drivers don't know how to drive and surely not how to treat tourists and the shops are closed half the day.We heard that Cyprus only lives in summer, but that is not an excuse to treat winter tourists in that way, specially hotels who work on tourists.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

30,"Great location with very nice restaurants and a roof-garden bar. Other than that, very average; not what anyone would expect from a Holiday Inn hotel.We stayed recently 2 times. First time in a superior executive room which was very nice, recently renovated. The second was a standard room and although it was also recently renovated, the bathroom (sometimes) smelled worse than sewage. The beds were very confortable in both rooms.Although we have no complain about the staff, it was very clear that the people working there are not happy employees. We have found out that they recently went on strike because the management did not pay their (very low) wages on time. We never saw anyone smiling there (and we do come there very often for dinner).In the first time I used the hotel wi-fi internet from my iphone to check the sports results. That cost me €10!!! Come on!The roof garden bar is a great place with live music, but be prepared to pay an overcharge on the drinks offered. The Bonzai sushi restaurant however is decent and the prices are reasonable (except the drinks).Breakfast was very average. 4 star hotels in Cyprus usually have 2-3 times wider variety and better quality food.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
50,Have stayed there a number of time and it has always been a great experience,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

10,Worst stay in a hotel that came right out of the 60'sEven the Tv control didn't work and one had to change the channel manually...The only worst hotel I have stayed has been in Amiens France,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

40,"This hotel is well located and walking distance to the famous Ledra street. Many shops/restaurants are available nearby. Rooms in this hotel is rather small but i supposed this is normal for Europe standard. Haloumi (the local Cypriot goat cheese) are served daily for breakfast and it is one of my favorite. They do have fine dining in the restaurant and in the evening they have a live band performing on the roof top. During summer time, it is pleasant to chill out here. Most of the time the owner is at the hotel and they are very hospitable people. I have stayed here more than 5 times and definitely will not be my last.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. I was due to stay in this hotel for 6 weeks but checked out after 2 weeks as I could stand it no longer! The executive rooms are on the 2nd floor and subject to terrible disco noise coming from the function rooms below and from outside night clubs. The noise usually started at about 10 pm and lasted well into the small hours of the morning. The standard rooms have been refurbished but are small and suffer from significant traffic noise. If you want to get a good night's sleep do not stay in this hotel. The food was routine and the service was slow. It was handy being in the centre of the city - this is about the only good thing to say about this hotel. it has no business calling itself a Holiday Inn as it is nothing like any Holiday inn I have stayed at before. AVOID!,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,Having read reviews we weren't too sure but we only wanted to stay one night so didn't think we were taking much of a risk. We were pleasantly surprised! - warm welcome at reception and I made a point of asking for a quiet room. We had a lovely room at the rear of the building which was large and well appointed. My only complaint would have been the smell of cigarette smoke!Strolled around the town which was nice and crossed over to the Turkish side - again very nice.We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant - Marco Polo - which was well worth it - excellent service - food - and the viwes over the city as it got dark was wonderful.All in all a nice visit to Nicosia,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,This hotel is definitely feeling the age. The only goo part is the location if you need to be near Laedra because it is only 10 minutes walk from the gate. Elevators are creepy and not working fine. Internet only works in some rooms. I am not going back also because it costs a fortune.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

40,"Stayed there for three nights, hotel was exactly what I needed. If what you're after is a hotel for your honeymoon don't go there, but for all other purposes, and assuming that your budget is not unlimited, this place provides for your basic needs: it's clean, central, the food is good and plentiful, AC. One doesn't really need more than this, it's not as if I came here to spend my entire holiday sitting in my hotel room.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"We paid €180 for a family room in March (ie low season) and no way was it worth it. Our room was very clean and thankfully not as shabby as other reviewers experienced, but the main problem was it was uncomfortably warm and stuffy. When we asked reception, they said the aircon system for all the guest rooms was still switched off, and that there was no way to regulate room temperature apart from opening the window! To make matters worse, the afternoon sun shone through the window, and our room overlooked the streets outside and the busy bus terminus directly opposite. I found it very difficult to relax or sleep in the room.The breakfast was OK but not really 4* or Holiday Inn standard. There was one staff member who was loosely 'on duty' but no-one came to clear away used plates, bowls, cutlery etc so we had to just pile them up on empty tables nearby. Reception staff were friendly but that was about it. Internet charge was a ridiculous €10 per day per item, i.e. €20 if one of you is on a laptop and another on an iPod etc in the same room - what a rip-off!!!!Amazingly for a capital city, there's a lack of hotel accommodation in downtown Nicosia. Next time we'll pay a little more to stay at the less convenient Hilton and hopefully at least get value for money",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"I am not even ging to get into the process of reviewing it!! Just avoid it because it will be probably ur worst hotel experience ever. Worst value for money, dirty, and low quality of services. Talking to some of the staff I realised that maybe the main reason of because the owner is a skroutz (!!) and is does not really invest in renovating it but just trying to preserve it wth the least possible cost and maximum profit. He wont get any far with this mentality. Pitty, because is not a bad location at all if u want to have easy access to the beautiful old city of Nicosia.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"This hotel is so shocking i am writing the review while here as i dont want any one to make the mistake of booking it!

10,"I have not actually stayed at the hotel but have visited the roof-top restaurant/bar ""Marco Polo"" and I would like to comment on the misleading prices and poor quality of service.Having been greeted by the surly maitre'd, we were told that we couldn't be served a light dinner at the bar. And this was despite having called earlier that day to make a reservation, when we were expressly told that appetizers are served at the bar.When we pointed this out to the maitre'd, he grudgingly consented to allow us to order appetizers... We ordered two appetizers and two drinks. The drinks were prized at the drinks menu at 12 euro each but when the bill arrived we were unpleasantly surprised to discover that they charged us 20 euro per drink. When we pointed this out to the waiter he told us that despite the catalogue prices, first drinks are charged at 20 euros! This is definitely the last time they see me there!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Great location for walking to the old town and to the Turkish Cypriot side. Location is the main selling point for this hotel as it is definitely below par for a Holiday Inn.The staff are friendly and made me feel very welcome. They seem to be overworked with very long hours and doing everything. You can see the same staff member serving at the bar downstairs, taking and delivering room service orders, and serving food and drinks in the lobby. The management seems to be saving money by not hiring adequate numbers of staff and by not spending anything on renovating the rooms that look like they are the original 1960s decor. Carpets and curtains are old and worn and not so clean. Towels are also very worn, but clean. The rooms are a mishmash of colors and designs -- my room included yellow, blue, and pink flower curtains; black, burgundy, and turquoise diamond pattern carpets; and royal blue bathroom tile. Shampoo and hand lotion are mounted in dispensing bottles in the shower -- reaching the lotion means having to get into the shower to do so.The internet service, at 10 Euros a day, did not work more than 30 min at a time during a one-week stay. The signal was extremely weak and kept failing (forget using Skype). The front desk staff seemed to know this was a problem and kept telling me to bring my computer to the lobby. One of the reasons I stayed here was because of the advertised wifi in the rooms.Restaurants are okay -- they have a nice ambience and the food is good if not exceptional. The variety is a nice surprise -- Japanese sushi and Italian. Breakfast is included and perfectly acceptable with eggs, breads, cereals, local halloumi cheese and feta. Would be nice to have a better selection of fruit given that Cyprus has lovely fruit; the hotel only served grapefruit and oranges.Noisy rooms across from carpark as others have noted. I will look at the Castelli and Centrum before returning here as the management seems not to be concerned about the ethical treatment of its staff or its guests.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"Stayed with wife and two young children. Cost 165 euos B&B per night.Cons first. Totally uninspiring hotel. Reception staff going through the motions. Room with tired decor, very small balcony facing the public car park which costs 10euros for 10 hours parking, no concessions for hotel stay. Breakfast average, milk not cold for cereal. Orange juice glasses very small, I always find this is a sign of a tight hotel.Pros. Nice comfy beds, big room. Indoor pool (though used for swimming lessons for non guests each time we went). Location good.Would not recommend this hotel, they seem happy to take the money but offer only the basics in return.There must be better in Nicosia.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

At the same time it is 100m away from Makariou street which is the main market of the new city. There is a modern lobby and the rooms are clean but need some renovation. It is overpriced if you compare it with other hotels of the chain. There is a parking place accross the hotel.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"I spent four nights at Holiday Inn-Nicosia. Location is fantastic, very near to the shopping district, public transport terminus and carpark in front of hotel. The only issue I had was with the unbearbale heat I had in both my rooms. I was given a room on the 5th floor and due to the heat, I tried to open the window with the consequence that you cannot sleep because of the cars. Then I changed room facing thr back of the hotel and I had the privilege to leave the window open so that at least in the last two days I managed to sleep. It is a real pity that this air conditioning issue almost ruined my stay at the hotel. I even had problem with the wireless internet which were resolved once I moved to the third floor room.Breakfast was good and the staff were on the whole ok.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"Stayed here with wife and 2 toddlers.Staff made a wonderful fuss of the children and really made us feel at home despite the hotel seemingly being more geared to business travellers.Bad PointsRestaurants, for a hotel, actually looked really good - why bad you might ask? Because 2 toddlers meant our dinner time is 17:30 and messy so we could not sample them. Next time will return without them so we can go for the sushi, Italain and Japanese buffet!The white wine was on top of the mini bar fridge and red in it.... hopefullly this shows that I am struggling for bad points....Very Good PointsLocation, Location, Location. Brilliant if you are a touristNice big rooms, ours had 2 double beds and a balconyCar park directly opposite, municipal but cheap - although mainly because Cypriot parking wardens only work part time so half the time no ticket is requiredEasy to find considering its location inside the walls of the old city, drove here from Pafos with wife directing and it did not result in a row!!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"The rooms are fine and spacious (mine had two double beds in it just for me!) though nothing special and the location is great for the centre of town. Reception staff were ok as was breakfast. Internet costs 10 euros per day.However when I arrived at 5pm and went up to my room it was still in the process of being cleaned and I had to sit there for about half an hour, exhausted from the flight, waiting for it to finished being cleaned.Also, when I left my room and closed the door it didn't lock (it was a card key type that locks automatically) which I could quite easily not have noticed and had to get it sorted out which was a nuisance as I was meeting people. One of my colleagues had a similar problem a few days later.I'm not sure how much my room cost (or the going rates in Nicosia) but I think if you can get a room for not too much more than 100 euros a night then it's probably an ok choice although definitely nothing special, but that you wouldn't want to pay too much more than that.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"I stayed here for five nights, unfortunately, for a conference. The room was tiny and amenities minimal, but I could live with that. But there is an outrageously loud nightclub in the hotel that plays ridiculously loud music until 3:00 in the morning every night, despite the fact that they advertise that they close at 11:30 PM. Perhaps you want to go to the night club, to dance the night away, but otherwise, I would advise you to find anyplace else in Nicosia. I travel all over the world all the time, and I can't remember a less pleasant place to sleep, or a less responsive management when I complained.I would also advise that you avoid the Japanese restaurant in the hotel, where all of the fish is frozen (as everywhere in Nicosia), and the sushi ""chef"" has no idea how to cut what he has. Stick to Greek or Turkish food -- you can get much better Japanese food almost anywhere in the world.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"In May of 2009 I had my second six night stay at the Holiday Inn this year. Again, I was quite pleased. In terms of hotel essentials, the place is very clean. My bedroom was a little dated but the bath had lots of marble and was immaculate. Again, I was on the front where the rooms are bigger and have a balcony but are a little noisier. The fabulous buffet breakfast came with my room. And, as every one notes, the location is great. I stayed at the Holiday Inn with about two dozen colleagues at a conference. I heard no noteworthy complaints. The rooms on the ""in-side"" are smaller and quieter but have no view. The Front Desk staff fixed us up with taxis very willingly. Bottom line, another very pleasant at Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,I would never stay in Holiday Inn (Nicosia) again! I had a bad experience because the room where I stayed had dirty sheets with blood on it when I checked in. When I asked a housekeeper to change the bed sheets they told me that theydont have new once any more. I asked them to show me other rooms and they were over booked and had only one room that had no view it was facing the wall. Very noisy and hotel smells of cigarets.Very old hotel needs rennovation and does not correspond at all to Holiday Inn class. I would recomend hotel Europa 4 stars in Nicosia and very clean and modern. I moved immideately with my suitcases the same night.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"The hotel is well situated in the centre of the Greek speaking side of the city. The room was fine but the breakfast was nothing special: no fruit salad (just a few pieces of fruit), reconstituted juice etc. Parking was available in the pay and display car park opposite the hotel. The room included a menu choice for pillows. We chose pillows No. 4 and 5 (feather pillows) as opposed to the foam filled pillows already supplied. Two more foam pillows were delivered. So we called reception again and were told no feather pillows were available that day but that they would be sent the next day. Two more pillows were indeed delivered the next day - at 07h00 when the maid just walked in to the room and woke us up, with two more foam filled pillows. All in all, the place was fine for two days but it was nothing exceptional.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,I stayed one day on the 6th floor. Checkin and out was quick. The place is clean and the minibar is stocked. Bath towel was large and everything that needs to be there was there. The only complaint I would have would be with the limited TV stations in English - just CNN and BBC. Bring your own DVD or notebook with movies or TV shows. Internet access costs 10Euro/day.,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"The hotel is in the old town Nicosia and therefore very central for sightseeing, shopping or eating out. The rooms are not as big as one might expect from a Holiday Inn but the bed was very big and comfortable. The bathroom had sufficient shampoo, body lotion etc and towels were ample. The pool was very welcome after trudging round all the sights. The restaurants were very good although the rooftop restaurant (Marco Polo) was closed although there were notices saying it was also open in winter. We were a little surprised at having to pay for internet as we were of the impression when checking in that this was included in the price.All in all a very pleasant hotel with friendly, attentative staff.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

The best thing of the hotel in our opinion, is its restaurants. Our favored is Bonzai(Japanese), which has amazing sushi!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"The hotel's rooms are small even by european standards. The bathroom is very difficult to use due to the size. The air conditioner didn't work properly. The breakfast included in the price was good. The street in front of the hotel is noisy and that noise from the street got into our room, regardless of windows closed or not. Most chipriots smoke everywhere, even where prohibited, the hotel is not different. Rooms were clean.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"This hotel has two things going for it - a good location and a fairly good Japanese sushi house inside. The Italian is acceptable, though not great. Rooms are comfortable, although small. Internet is for a fee - 10 euro. Parking is across the street at a municiple lot, around 5 euro per day. The hotel will take your car keys and pay the parking for you if you wish and charge your bill. You can not get an iron or board in your room - you must take your laundry to the 2nd floor and press it there, or for a large fee you can have the hotel do it. All in all, it is a decent place to stay, but not great. The location is nice if you are planning on visiting the old town, although for business it isn't centrally located. I would stay again, but first check out the Hilton or other hotels that are in the same price range as the Holiday Inn - I found the price high for quality.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre

Like other travelers, I found that cleaning was a hit or miss affair - some days the room was vacuumed, other days it wasn't. Sheets were changed occasionally, towels on a daily basis (despite being a ""green"" hotel). While there is an individual thermostat in the room (with a temp range of 5-30C), it really doesn't work on an individual basis. During my visit the heat was on throughout the hotel and it was 30C outside! You have to turn it off and open the windows - and then get all the noise and smells from the kitchen and streets, etc. The best thing about the hotel is its location near Ledra Street.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
40,"We stayed at the Nicosia Holiday Inn for two nights in mid-March.We stayed in a very spacious room on the 2nd floor, which was very clean, hospitable (cookies and fruit upon arrival), had a huge TV and was very comfortable.During our stay, we were very pleased to experience none of the problems previous travellers had mentioned. The room was extremely quiet. Although the room was on the front road, we had no problema with traffic or other noises.We had no problems whatsoever with cleanliness and all our requests were met promptly. The beds were very comfortable indeed.Breakfast was of good quality and plentiful and staff in the breakfast room eager to helpI would also recommend the hotel for its central location",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"I can only speak of the out-of-season experience here - accommodation was reasonable, but housekeeping and cleaning seemed very hit and miss (often the latter); the Italian restaurant was quite acceptable, and, with Bistrot 1900 across the other side of Ledra St, completed the list of two good Euro restaurants in Nicosia. When I did observe the hotel to be rather busy, the breakfast staff were not able to cope very well; with fewer of us they managed quite effectively. I was glad to have a room positioned midway between the 6th floor night-club, and the street, as being the only way to survive the noise. The foyer refreshment area is not special, and pricey as well; two grubby computer stations in the foyer were not inspiring either. The internet 'cafe' a few doors down was the better option (with Skype headsets). I suspect that at the height of the season things could be worse at this hotel, and I shall go elsewhere on another visit.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"I had to stay for three weeks on business, and I selected this hotel because it seemed to have good facilities, but actually it was quite a weird place.I used the pool quite often, as I like swimming, but it was open shorter hours than advertised on the website and in the brochures in the room. It was also used every time I was there (except Sunday morning) by a swimming teacher for local children, one to four children at a time, which I hadn't expected.The food at Bonzai Japanese restaurant was excellent, although the chefs (very friendly) were from the Philippines, not Japan. The other restaurant Vivere served such enormous meals that I could never eat more than a first course. Both were quite expensive.The breakfast was nice, but to get coffee, you had to ask a waiter to bring it, rather than getting it from the buffet, and, if it was crowded, or the waiters just decided to go walkabout into the kitchen, you could go without entirely!The room was not bad, I was away from all the noisy things on the 3rd floor. But the housekeeping! One day I came back at 7:30pm, having been at work all day since 8:30am, to find that the room had not been cleaned. When I told the front desk (the Housekeeping number on the phone never answered), they said I must have put the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out, which was not correct. They did call the maid for me to clean while I was having dinner, but she wasn't happy about it.The maid also left me several times without towels, handtowels or face cloths, sometimes all three.And the really great day was when I left my washing in the bag in my room with the ""washing"" sign on the door, at 8am, when I went to work. When I came back in the evening, the sign had been removed from the door and placed on top of the bag of unwashed washing inside the room! This was unbelievably inconvenient, and the front desk didn't apologise or offer to get it done urgently for me.I wouldn't stay there again, with such erratic service, and it is really very expensive for these things to happen.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"I have been in many Holiday Inn hotels in many cities for many years, but this one has nothing to do with the famous firm. It's an extremely expensive hotel taking into account the a so low level of services provided.The only advantages is the location in the center of Nicosia and the size of the rooms. But....Everything here is so noisy. I had an executive room (all executive rooms are located on the 1st floor!!!) and I couldn't sleep all night. The nose from the main road was horrible.The cleanliness of the room is doubtful. Especially this moquette on the floor must be there for many many years....The bathroom is OK if you don't take into account the always wet and stained buthtab (because of a water leakage...)The hotel provides wireless internet access to its clients at a very high costThe hotel is very ... smelly. I don't know how happens and when you are in the corridor you feel like being in the reastaurant.The reception is very friendly, but all the above this is the least you could expect....",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn in Nicosia for most of the year since June on business. The hotel was selected due to its location near to the Ledra Street crossing into the north. The rooms are tired and in the process of being refurbished. Throughout the summer you should avoid the higher floor rooms if you need to sleep, due to the Marco Polo live misic blasting out into the early hours. As I had to work over Christmas my family joined me so I booked executive rooms what a mistake they are right above the function rooms and as mentioned on other reviews the noise is like haviing a rock group playing live in your room until 0230 int he morning which is hopeless if you are trying to sleep. Complaints about the noise go un-answered. My advice if you have to stay is to ask for a midfloor room numbered between room 08 - 11 on the floor eg 408 its the best of a poor situation.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"Just spent 1 night on Sunday. After reading reviews from other members about this particular property, it is confirmed that all mentioned in the other reviews were correct. Although reception did the jobs what they required to do (just checking in people and hand the key. No explanations about breakfast, restaurants, other hotel facilities or even where the guest lift was, etc. We had to ask!), no personality at all in this hotel and staff. Neither Holiday Inn characteristics nor Cypriot characteristics. It was just a city hotel with minimum services and facilities. Our room was on 1st floor and right above function room on Mezzanine floor and could hear all the noise from the lobby and function room. Corridors smelt of food at the time of arrival (4.30pm), after evening out (10.30pm) and the following morning (6.30am)...all the time which was not so pleasant. Bonzai Japanese Restaurant within the hotel was closed on Sunday night, although hotel advertises it opens for 7 days. Instead, we were offered to sit at the bar and order food from Bonzai restaurant. We did not eat at the Bonzai restaurant as the Bar looked busy and we did not think it was appropriate to eat at the bar when paying for the full prices for the proper restaurant. So, we were off to Seiko Japanese restaurant which was only 5 minutes walk from the hotel and the service and atmosphere was great. Lastly, the hotel was over heated throughout the day. The outside temperature on the night was 2 degrees but we were sweating in the room without in-room heating. Had to remove bedspread, blanket and sheets not to sweat during the night although our windows were wide open over night. The temperature was controlled by central heating system of the hotel and we couldn't do anything. For 1 nighters, it's a decent hotel to stay. Municipal car parking right opposite to the hotel (CY£1.90 for overnight) and most of cafes and shops within easy walking distance. Buffet breakfast had wide range of choices and nicely displayed. We may stay else where if we visit Nicosia again in future.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
10,"Decided on giving the Holiday Inn a second try, only because of its close location to the green zone which I had to cross daily for a client on the other side. While the staff still remains friendly and as accomodating as they can be, the conditions of the hotel greatly outweigh this. Last time I was on the 6th floor right below the restaurant/club. The noise once they opened, was intolerable. This time, I was on the second floor facing the main street. And while having a room with a balcony was nice, that was about it. My room was right next door to the service elevator and stairwell. Every morning for two weeks, the cleaning staff was quite loud - right outside of my door. In addition, not only did music carry through the stairwell, it carried also from the restaurant on the first floor which had live music on certain nights. While I understand the need for entertainment, this went on till 2:30 in the morning including on week nights. Clearly, management does not understand that their first and utmost priority should be to the lodgers of their establishment, not the restaurant/club patrons. Aside from very worn rooms and uncomfortable beds there seems to be zero ventiliation system in the hotel. Given anytime of the day, you will smell the restaurant odors throughout the halls. I have had several colleagues who have stayed here in the last six months and they all echo the same sentiments. They have all moved to the Centrum down the street. Regardless of the fact, that I am a Platinum Priority club member - I will no longer stay at the Holiday Inn on my next visits. Forget the fact that the Holiday Inn is a well known name, for the sake of sanity - stay somewhere else.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"This is a totally characterless hotel and could be anywhere in the world. There is nothing Greek about its atmosphere and the cuisine available reinforces the point. It is however clean and would suit a single person on business or a couple wanting to spend one night only in Nicosia and see the sights there, such as they are. This is because the rooms – or at least the one experienced – are very small and cramped indeed and there was little space free around the double bed. The air-conditioner is cunningly sited directly under the curtains so that the cold air blasts up to be trapped behind them, thus making temperature control somewhat problematical. The Marco Polo restaurant on the roof is to be avoided if any conversation is to be attempted – a dancing floor at the other end of the roof was subject to thumping “music” that must have breached all known regulations for allowable noise levels. Service was slow in the extreme, the food adequate but not memorable and certainly not worth the price – but then Cyprus is expensive. Back in the bathroom the remains of a soap tablet were stuck firmly to the bath – the narrow bottom of which was so steeply concave that standing in it for a shower was quite hazardous. A particularly unpleasant aspect of the hotel was the small advertisement in the room proclaiming in several languages that Blue Movies were available on a 24-hour basis. It is unpleasant to feel that one is in an establishment that panders to guests with such tastes and it is a good reason why parents travelling with children should avoid it. The morning wake-up call requested was seven minutes late, which is unacceptable when an automated system is being used. The breakfast buffet was acceptable but bland. The final verdict is that this is a hotel to avoid unless you have to spend one night in Nicosia – and if you’ve a longer stay in mind, find somewhere else!",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
30,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn Nicosia Center, two nights in August 2006. The room was a good size for the price (£96 cy per night) with a nice bathroom and plenty of towels. The room was nicely decorated. The floor our rooms were on was non smoking, but the room was used by smokers. Two ashtrays, full, were outside the window. Tea & coffee making equipment was present which is missing from many continental hotels, I felt the quantities were mean – Although the staff were happy to supply more FOC. The room was air conditioned but only active when a key card is inserted in the electric control box; this meant the room took a long time to be comfortable (Nicosia is very hot in August). A room safe was provided at no extra cost. We used two of the hotel restaurants. The Chez Nous restaurant used for breakfast was open until 10:30am. Even dining close to the closing time there was a very good choice of foods, and the staff were very attentive. The Vivere Restaurant (Italian) had a good selection of starters, main courses & sweets. Our choice, two courses with a nice wine was £50 cy for two adults. – All excellent. The staff, although serving another party of about 25 diners, still managed our requirements with unhurried style 9/10. Use of a computer in the lobby was £3 cy per 30 minute. Access to the internet via Wi-fi was £6 cy per day. I felt that the Wi-fi should be provided free in the light of this class of hotel and the low cost of connection today. The reception staff were very pleasant, even though the staff did advise incorrectly about the opening times of the Cyprus museum. The hotel is convenient for the Old town and many restaurants are within walking distance.",Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
20,The Holiday inn was disappointing. I have stayed in a lot of HI but this one was pretty awful. The rooms were lousy although having a balcony helped. It was quite noisy and the rooms were also very small and shabby. The lift was slow and the staff lacksidasical! There were 2 nice restaurants. In particular the rooftop bar and restaurant was lovely and the locals said they went there dancing! My suggestion is that you find a nicer hotel and go for the dancing too! Don't stay at the Nicosia HI!,Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre
