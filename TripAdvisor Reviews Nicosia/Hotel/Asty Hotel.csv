50,"Like having a family in Nicosia. We loved staying at Asty in November will always stay here, we had more reservations last May but due to covid we had to cancel I pray we get back next May. They are everything a hotel should be. Thank you!!",Asty Hotel
50,"OK, it’s a good value 2 star hotel, it is modest and a little old fashioned, but...... a super hotel with comfortable beds, but more importantly with super friendly staff. An enjoyable stay. My only critics was that they provided clean towels every day and took the once used soap away... perhaps they were trying too hard. But I would recommend this hotel unreservedly.",Asty Hotel
50,"Highly recommended hotel, I booked this hotel for my 50th birthday and valentine's day. Arriving the day before valentine's day I was very surprised to be upgraded to one of the Executive rooms, in particular room number 506. The room was clean, well presented, the bed was very comfortable, the room also had a large sofa, nice bathroom with nice shower. The room had a large balcony, tea and coffee facilities, a fridge, television with many channels, a heater which kept the room warm. There is 24 hour access to drinks and snacks in the restaurant area, along with breakfast which has a good choice and selection. The hotel also offers a free shuttle service which was useful to get to and from Solomou Sqaure. As well as the free shuttle service, there is a gym, a games area, crazy golf, access to bicycles. The hotel is also located to a very good bus route with the 259 bus linking Solomou Square which is the main area of Nicosia for transport links to airports, other resorts, and the Nicosia Mall and Cyprus Mall. The staff here are all very friendly, very welcoming and very helpful.",Asty Hotel
50,"Large room. Very clean. Friendly staff. Good breakfast: choice of eggs freshly prepared plus buffet with some cheeses, bacon, potatoes, mushrooms, beans, some breads, juices, fresh fruit and tea and coffee choices. Specially appreciated the snacks available without charge all day: jello, yogurt, rice pudding, coffee, tea, apples and oranges, Turkish delight and some others.Asty is about 1 mile from Nicosia center ( walkable) and there are some restaurants and shops in area. I used their free shuttle to Nicosia provided ( said allowed 2 times each day: do not know charge if request additional times ) on demand. Presumably if hotel is busy there could be waits but I never had to wait.Also there are free bikes available ( helmets and vest said to be provided) but I did not see anyone use them",Asty Hotel
40,"The hotel has a homey feel and is located in a quiet neighborhood at a 10 min drive from the old town. Has a private parking lot. Its rooms are a bit larger than normal (small) European standards, have air conditioning (a little noisy) for heating and cooling, a refrigerator and a TV screen with enough news channels. Breakfast buffet is just ok and includes eggs prepared as you like. They should improve it, by offering for example, more juice choices. WiFi works well everywhere. It offers a free shuttle to downtown twice a day, has bicycles for rent and also a self service laundry for a small price.Its prices are very reasonable. Good place to stay!",Asty Hotel
40,"The Atsy is a little different, a touch dated but well maintained and very well run. The reviews about the great staff are spot on, they were super helpful. The room is a touch on the smaller, sort of Euro sized, but ample. The room I was in didn't really have a desk so for biz travelers, this could be a bit of a difficulty. The wifi was pretty good and since my cell phone didn't work in Cyprus, I pushed that a little. The room was sort of artsy with tiled pieces throughout and colorful tile in the bathroom. The Atsy taxi service doesn't go everywhere but since I was working at the University, they took me two days which was nice. I didn't use the bikes but that is a nice touch also. Breakfast was good and custom made eggs every morning. The price was very reasonable.Next time I'm in Nicosia, there is now doubt where I'm staying,",Asty Hotel
50,I stayed at Asty for a work trip in November. It's a bit quirky but I loved it. The staff were incredibly helpful especially when I locked my hire car key in the boot of the car. On that note there is ample parking available. They have bikes to hire and a free taxi service to the centre of Nicosia.Great breakfast too. I already am looking forward to my return in March 2020.,Asty Hotel
50,"From the second we walked through the door, warm smiles and kind words made us feel immediately that we had made a good decision. Although we had arrived early, we were invited to have a free drink and cake while we waited for our room to be cleaned. Then we were upgraded to one of the three executive rooms- spacious, funky decor, spotlessly clean, warm and inviting, with a fridge, safe, hairdryer, kettle .... fantastic!After a busy day sightseeing, we headed to the small bar and asked for a glass of wine. As I produced my purse, the lady smiled and said it was complementary! Wow! The whole hotel was warm in December and we felt very comfortable.Breakfast was buffet style with a big range of hot and cold food. Eggs were cooked to order and there was everything you could possibly want. We have never, ever, received such warmth and generosity from hoteliers anywhere in the world. We were allowed to leave our car on site until we were ready to leave the city, and when we popped in to say a final farewell, we were once again offered a drink and a snack before we left. Incredible hospitality, yet , thankfully, we didn’t witness anyone taking advantage of this. The family are warm hearted and genuine and it seems the clientele respect this.Just one thing to note: the street has quite long sections with no pavements, so take a torch if you plan to walk out in the evenings. Other than that, just try this little gem for yourselves!",Asty Hotel
50,"My friend and I visited Nicosia and stayed for a week in Asty Hotel in October 2019. Hotel was very clean and felt like home to us,it offers a lot for a great price. We kept asking if stuff there is for free because we couldn't believe that it offers so many great (and free) things haha! 😂All of the employees we met there treated us in a way that made us feel so welcome and good. They helped us every day with some great advice, etc. We sure hope to come back there soon! Greetings from Croatian girls, Dorjana and Amelia! 🤗",Asty Hotel
50,"I have a Cyprus family now. I can not express enough of how this hotel makes you feel welcomed and appreciated. The staff is unsurpassed and the hotel fits like an old pair of jeans. It is clean and warm. The hotel was built in the seventies, of which, coupled with the service will wisp you back when people mattered and comfort was Paramount. The breakfast is complete and suptuous. I was there with my family and we got to select our rooms and traveling with a 10 month old infant, they instantly brought a baby bed to complement our spacious room. We will return to Asty to see our new family members and relish in the warmth of their generousity and warmth. I suggest you do the same!",Asty Hotel
50,The Asty hotel is well worth considering if planning a visit to Nicosia. The rooms are comfortable with tea/ coffee making facilities . There is plenty of space to chill and relax around the reception area. We were made very welcome during our stay and the free shuttle service into the city centre is a bonus.,Asty Hotel
30,"The room was basic, clean and quiet, but the location i did not like, it was a 20 min walk to civilization and not much street lighting, The Bar was not stocked so on arrival i couldnt get a beer, apart from breakfast there was no other meals available. I left after one day and went to Larnaca which was much more inviting",Asty Hotel
40,Asty Hotel is a budget hotel not far from the city center. Free shuttle services to and from the city center are provided and bike rentals are available. The hotel has an own parking lot and offers free parking. The rooms are basic but very spacious and clean. Breakfast is standard but sufficient.I was very impressed by the super friendly service and felt at home right away. Would definitely recommend Asty Hotel for a short stop over in Nicosia!,Asty Hotel
50,"I have stayed at several higher end hotels but always come back here. It is family run and the friendly family attitude runs through all the staff. That is its greatest asset. There is a free shuttle into town but if you prefer you can borrow one of their bikes. I come for business and profit from the computer room and library to work in during the evenings. If things get too hot, there is a cool air-conditioned, comfortable lounge -more like a family living room than a cold impersonal hotel lounge. There are nearby restaurants for evening meals or you can bring a takeaway and enjoy it on the patio.",Asty Hotel
50,"My experience at Atsy Hotel was absolutely great!!! The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I arrived much earlier than the check in time, and the staff allowed me to go into the rooms ahead of time and pay the accommodation cost later:)The hotel room was clean and cosy with reasonable price. The breakfast was very good with wide range of things to eat, and they can also prepare fresh eggs for you if you like. The 24-hour beverages and snacks were great, I enjoyed the hot chocolate so much!!The shuttle services are offered twice a day which is very convenient!! The general environment of the hotel is nice and peace with an antique piano downstairs for music lovers to play. I enjoyed playing piano and chatting with friends here. I especially love the blue light as the hotel's main colour, it looks beautiful at night! I met my best friend Chris who is also one of the staff here, we had a great time spending together in Nicosia!!I enjoyed my stay here so much and highly recommend it to all travelers. If I come to Nicosia next time I will definitely stay in Asty Hotel again!!Rain",Asty Hotel
50,Very cosy family hotel to stay in Nicosia. Very tidy and air-conditioned rooms. Friendly and helpful personnel. Superb and rich breakfast. Two free transports a day within Nicosia. Very good value for money.,Asty Hotel
50,"This is a very nice and welcoming hotel. From the point you enter, a modest reception welcomes you but the family style is really inviting. I got room 506, called the zebra room indeed its theme was zebras. The ambience is nice and the rooms had all the necessary amenities. Highly recommended for family trips. One draw back is the fact it uses soap made in China whereas Cyprus is known for its olive oil and olive oil soap.",Asty Hotel
50,"We just spent 3 nights at the Asty hotel and we were very pleased with their accomodation.The hotel staff are very welcoming and helpful.We arrived much earlier than the check in, and they allowed us to go into our rooms ahead of time. As well, we were invited for a complimentary breakfast that very morning.Rooms are clean and roomy: nice balcony, air conditioning, TV and hairdryer. The room decor is dated, but in very good condition.Breakfast is included in the price and offers a wide range of things to eat.Beverages and snacks available in the dining room 24/7.Shuttle rides to the city centre are offered at your convenience - twice a day. the hotel is on a bus line as well. 10 minute ride to the city.Reasonable prices for the ""family"" service you receive.",Asty Hotel
50,The hotel is excellent and the staff is very helpful. Check in was perfect and the rooms are nice and clean. The breakfast was perfect with a variety of choices and also they can prepare your eggs fresh as you like it. Great hospitality from all the staff of the hotel. Definitely i will book again!!!,Asty Hotel
50,"My experience at Atsy Hotel was great. The hotel was clean, the room was basic but nice, and the breakfast was very good. Staff was very nice and accommodating. I walked to the old town, which was probably 20-30 minutes away. The shuttle is available and probably ideal as the sidewalks aren't very well maintained when walking. The 24-hour snacks were a great perk and the rice pudding was delicious! I enjoyed my stay here and highly recommend it to other travelers.",Asty Hotel
50,"We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Asty in Nicosia and can't recommend enough this lovely hotel. The hotel staff led by the owner Michael are about the best you can hope for on a visit to a new place: super-friendly, informative, helpful and accommodating. The facilities are clean and welcoming. As mentioned before there are free snacks and drinks all day long, nicely decorated lounge, and to top this their shuttle service which is fantastic. We were taken to both the university and the town center at a moment's notice. They also offer free bicycles for the use of their guests. I will definitely stay here again and recommend anyone coming to Nicosia to do that as well!",Asty Hotel
40,"Stayed at this hotel on two accessions first one they upgraded me to one of their suite so could not argue for the price and the room type the second time i got a regular room which is what i booked and i was not disappointed the property is dated in construction but it seems they have renovated the hotel, some items are like from the 60s but it is clean, quite and the beds were comfortable and clean. the breakfast was surprisingly good with eggs to order and a large spread of food and cereal over all i would return to this city hotel",Asty Hotel
40,"Lovely family run hotel with friendly staff, clean spacious rooms, great breakfast, shuttle service, easy parking and all for a reasonable price. Recommended for short and long visits. Keep up the good work!",Asty Hotel
30,We stayed here for one night and it did the job. It was clean yet basic and dated. We only needed to sleep there so we didn’t mind that it was quite drab.The staff were really friendly and the free shuttle service in to town was great.,Asty Hotel
50,"I went to visit a family member studying in Nicosia. I was alone, without my wife and wanted to spend my money not on a vacation hotel, but rather just needed a place to leave my suitcase and lay down to sleep. This is not the most opulent hotel in the world. In fact it is very basic, old and worn. Yet the rooms are clean and spacious, the water is hot with a very large bathtub, has free parking and it is quiet.Why give it 5 stars? Well, the people who own/operate and service the hotel are some of the nicest you will find. Bend-over backwards nice. The breakfast is included and filling, and they offer almost everything you could want. They have shuttle service, bikes, maps and evening snacks.Had the hotel been a Hilton or Four Season they would deserve 7 stars.",Asty Hotel
40,"I stayed at the Asty Hotel for a couple of nights while visiting Nicosia for a friend's 40th birthday celebrations. It is a cheap basic hotel with all the essentials and no frills. The management have clearly thought about what budget travellers actually want and provided those items.My room, reached by a lift, was reasonably large, plain but clean. It was a non-smoking room. There were smoking rooms nearby, but the smoke didn't penetrate my room. The heating was adequate. The tap water was not for drinking (as is common in Cyprus) but a good supply of bottled water was provided.The bathroom was clean, but there was no bath plug and the bath (a shade of blue fashionable in Britain around 1960) and the grouting of the tiles were stained and needed replacing. The shower attachment on the bath was easy to use and had good water pressure. A hairdryer was provided.The staff were friendly and chatty. The hotel is a little way from the centre of Nicosia, in a modern suburb, but the hotel provides a shuttle taxi, at a time of your choosing, into and out of the centre, once a day each way for each visitor.There was a range of cereals and hot and cold options for breakfast. The communal areas are smart and modern.For the price, this hotel is very good value.",Asty Hotel
50,"Very welcoming family and all the staff cannot do enough to help you out; from the warm initial welcome to the final goodbye.Older decor, but spotlessly clean generously sized rooms.Free bottled water on arrival and unlimited from a filter machine downstairs together with free coffee juices and home made rice 24/7; a rare treat!A few blocks out of town but great value for money and with free shuttle service whenever you want 7-8 and only €6-7 back in a taxi late at Night location is no problem",Asty Hotel
50,"What a fantastic hotel. I have one complaint which I will leave until the end, but it doesn't in any way detract from a wonderful stay. Although the hotel is a little away from the city centre there is a free shuttle service into town. The staff are all very friendly and can't do enough to help. Free tea, coffee and snacks ate available 24 hours a day, and the breakfasts are superb. The rooms are very nice, and it is very good value. I would highly recommend it. Now, the complaint. The manager recommended eating at the nearby Leventis restaurant. It was awful, as my review of it explains. Better go into the city centre to eat as my friend and I did on the three other nights we were there.",Asty Hotel
40,"We went for a quick overnight stay in Nicosia to conduct a bit of business at the American embassy. Asty Hotel was such a nice place to spend the night and very convenient to the embassy area. The staff is wonderfully friendly and very helpful. They have a nice coffee, tea, fruit and small treats available downstairs 24/7 and a good breakfast with a lot of variety. There aren’t many restaurants in the area but they have a deal with a delivery service and we were able to just stay in and get some passable dinner. The shuttle service is also helpful since they are a bit outside the main part if town. It’s not fancy but it’s super clean and great value for the money. High recommendation.",Asty Hotel
50,"For the price (we paid €66 for 2 pax) this hotel is hard to beat. It’s not fancy by any means and it’s not in downtown but the staff are all friendly and helpful and there is a free shuttle to the downtown about 7 mins away. They also dropped us at a local restaurant but we walked back because it’s close.Breakfast is fine for this part of the world. We visited January and I was amazed at how much choice they had, including eggs cooked to order.The rooms are spacious, simple and clean.We were doing this trip on a budget and for the price I could not complain and would recommend this just on the pleasant staff (the Zimbabwean Cypriot lady and the night manger were both to be commended).",Asty Hotel
50,"Stayed 3 nights on arrival into Cyprus. Super friendly helpful staff is the huge mainstay of this hotel. While decor is a little dated, it is clean, spacious and comfortable. Full breakfast and fresh eggs any way you like plus free shuttle into the centre of town. Convenient location also big plus. Huge gym in the basement and a coin operated laundry, only €3 for wash and €2 for drying.",Asty Hotel
50,"Staff were extremely welcoming and friendly, we arrived early and they were ok with an early check in.Room was nice, clean and very spacious.Hotel offers free shuttle service inside Nicosia.Hotel offers free drinks and snacks 24/7Breakfast was excellent and dining area was very clean and nice.Over all great value for money and I 100% recommend this hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed 4 nights and loved every minute. Breakfast was great, shuttle service outstanding, rooms - nothing fancy, but more than sufficient. What makes the Asty one of my most memorable hotels are the people!!! Every employee was extremely helpful, patient and friendly!!! I think this is the only hotel in the world where one can learn how to bake Cyprian olive bread from the front desk clerk at 1 am!!!! Thank you!!!",Asty Hotel
50,Very nice hotel! Friendly people recommended for families or business !! Clean room change towels every day ! Good breakfast the make fresh eggs as you like ! Nice location in the center! Perfect view of city in upper floor we’re I stay 5 floor !,Asty Hotel
50,"Just booked in for 1 night, upgraded for free. Hotel is a short ride from the centre using the free shuttle bus. Staff were really friendly and helpful with recommendations where to visit and eat. Complimentary soft drinks, tea,coffee and snacks with a great breakfast range. Can not fault this hotel, will definitely come back for a longer trip next time.",Asty Hotel
40,"If you expect something fancy we will be disappointed. But the hotel is really cheap in comparison to the competition and the rooms are OK; clean with the necessary furniture and services. Breakfast can be improved but in the pros is the 24 h free refreshments, coffee, tea. Highly recommended",Asty Hotel
50,This is our second trip to Cyprus.A highlight of visiting this wonderful place is coming back to visit the AstyThe location the lovely environment the staff and Mr Michael make your stay extra specialWe were gifted the Executive SuiteNeed I say more!The complimentary full breakfast is always a treat as is the facility to be able to enjoy fruits desserts drinks during the day in the dining roomThere is a Shuttle Service into Ledra Street which makes getting around the Old Town so easy.Me Michael provided extra care kindly tome when I had a fall He has actually gifted me a set of crutches to help me in my journey home ! Thankyou so muchThe care and attention was more than 100 +++. Almost forgot to Thankyou fir the complimentary Banquet Lunch,Asty Hotel
50,"We loved this hotel. The management were incredibly friendly offering us rides to old town even though we had a car! Breakfast was fantastic with a huge assortment of choices including eggs cooked on request. The room was big and comfortable, however, the bed was harder than we are use to but we slept great. It is farther to old town than I thought(about 30 minutes walking)but we enjoyed the excursion to dinner one night. The second night we went to the Syrian Arab Friendship Club for dinner and it was fantastic and on a short distance. The room 215 was so quiet and the water worked great.",Asty Hotel
50,"Mr Michael and his staff went out of their way to make our stay at Asty Hotel a comfortable and memorable one. Excellent location, close to the city, complimentary shuttle service. Fantastic breakfast, large selection, complimentary tea/ coffee, juices snacks. At all the other places we stayed at in Cyprus, no complimentary tea/ coffee or snacks were offered. Large comfortable rooms, free wifi, gym. Definitely will stay here again on our return. Thank you.",Asty Hotel
50,Asty catered for all our holiday needs and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.Friendly staff and clean rooms and willing to help to make our stay better!Definitely check this place out for your next Cyprus holiday! Thank you Mr Michael and his staff !,Asty Hotel
20,"Stayed 4 nights at Asty hotel and saw nothing special except its very nice staff. When my friend who lives in Cyprus recommended me to stay in Asty Hotel due to its excellent value and great prices, I referred to TripAdvisor reviews and found the hotel great and worth to stay. A fast check-in was a good sign of choosing the right hotel but by entering my room, I was disappointed by the old shabby blanket and bed sheet, not clean towels, damaged bathroom door, noisy refrigerator while working...Every other day they forget to clean up either my room or my colleague room. Breakfast was simple but ok comparing the price and internet was free at good speed entire the hotel.A 24 hours self service with fruit, coffee and juices was available in breakfast room, a very good idea for the guests when arrive in hotel too late from the work.Location to me was not fine and I didn't see restaurants or shopping area nearby.This hotel is recommended for those people who intend to stay in Nicosia for long time more than 3-4 weeks, reasonable price wise perhaps.",Asty Hotel
50,Fantastic Value for money Hotel. Very clean. Staff helpful and the Shuttle Bus is an added Advantage.superb Breakfast and complimentary tea and coffee drinks available all day. Rooms large and comfortable. 2 star rating should be upgraded,Asty Hotel
50,"we stayed at the Asty hotel whilst playing a festival gig with our band, the Hotel is comfortable and serves a great breakfast, our room was clean and the beds were comfy, good air conditioning and a great shower, the staff were class! always helpful , nothing was a problem for them, free lifts into town and returned when needed, not a problem to keep our room on when our flight was at night,highly recommend the Asty, i hooe we return one day, thank you from TYSONDOG",Asty Hotel
50,"I've spent 2,5 months in this hotel and I am very satisfied with everything about it. It is located close to the city centre. The rooms are comfortable. Wi-Fi works perfectly all over the hotel and even outside it on a pretty big distance. Breakfast is outstanding! However, the most significant feature of the hotel is its personnel and the family that owns it. They are very friendly, always ready and willing to help. I would advise everyone who visits Nicosia to stay at this place!",Asty Hotel
50,"I have visited the hotel 4 times in a row while on bussiness. I am absolutely satisfyed. The breakfast is one of the excellent features. Also the staff, which is very polite, can drive you downtown for free if you ask. Clean cozy bedrooms also. It surely is value for money!",Asty Hotel
50,"Very friendly family run Hotel Asty is a great budget hotel with lots of extra facilities, in a quiet area of Nicosia. A short drive to car parking near the centre, although it is walkable for young and fit. Our room was on 5th floor at back, very quiet, with fridge and coffee making facilities but need to get milk from restaurant which has 24 hour hot and cold drinks and snacks. Large sitting areas to relax in after a busy day exploring Nicosia. Excellent breakfast with wide choice of food and eggs cooked to order.",Asty Hotel
50,"We had opportunity to enjoy friendly atmosphere of this family owned hotel since 24th to 28th June 2018. The hotel personnel provide us assistance in the case, when we had no chance to find another hotel after been cast out from the hotel Castelli. The rooms were clean and well equipped, 24/7 services for the quests in the hotel lobby including free refreshment (hot and cool drinks, fruits), free shuttle from the hotel to the old part of the city and in our case even to any other part of the city, were the services over standard hotel behavior. We fully recommend all to enjoy stay in this hotel when visiting Nicosia.Josef Koc,Czech republic",Asty Hotel

50,"I really enjoyed my 2 nights stay in this hotel. It is close to the embassy of US and many other embassies. The staff is friendly and helpful. It's not a fancy hotel, but there several things that you can never find in fancy hotels. I enjoyed their free bikes too to visit the city.",Asty Hotel
50,"We were welcomed warmly like long lost friends. The hotel is in a good location with free shuttle service to the center of the city. The hotel also has free bicycles for those who like to ride.

50,"Had a wonderful room with a balcony to view Nicosia. A great feature was two complemementary shuttle rides to and from a destination of our choice in central Nicosia. Drinks and snacks were available around the clock from the dining room. The cooked eggs were great for breakfast but the side dishes, mushrooms, bacon etc should have been kept hotter.",Asty Hotel
50,Great Hotel with wonderful staff and lots of great facilities- we were warmly welcomed on arrival and introduced to a beautifully maintained bedroom with great air con and a fantastically comfortable bed.Snacks available free of charge throughout the day and we were shuttled into town compliments of the house mid afternoon.We returned after a long day of exploring this fascinating city late last night and were greeted with a complementary drink on the house.Take a bow everyone at ASTY,Asty Hotel

40,"Stayed here on bed and breakfast basis. Room was okay but other aspects of this little hotel made up for what the room may have lacked...and I don't mean there was anything particularly wrong with the room it was just a little bit dated for us. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful and the breakfast in the morning was plentiful. Loved the fact they provided snacks all day which guests can help themselves to..little jelly pots and plenty of fruit, tea and coffee etc...great wee place with some nice restaurants nearby and just a short walk into the town.",Asty Hotel
40,"there are so many good to say . the staff are so helpful - recommend excellent places to eat and take you there. if it is before 8.30 pm , you can ring for a return lift. in fact you can get a lift just about anywhere. there are snacks left out 24 /7 , there are bikes to borrow with vest and helmet at no charge , there is a games room and even a library - the list goes on and on . the rooms could do with upgrading but no big deal",Asty Hotel

And a very friendly and helpful team, at the front desk and in the kitchen! Many thanks to all!",Asty Hotel
50,"I am in the Asty hotel right now as I write this review. I have stayed here before in 2012 and 2014. This is a proper family run business, the owner Michael can be seen around the hotel every day. If you need anything you just ask and it is there for you. The restaurant is great, they serve breakfast every morning and if you feel hungry at any other time during the day you can go into the dining room and help your self to any food and drinks and any items from the fridge. I would recommen this hotel 100% to anyone who wants to be within a 5 minute drive of the centre of the old city of Nicosia. Michael and his staff are wonderful and very accommodating. If you want an excellent hotel experience then I would urge you to book into Asty hotel.",Asty Hotel

40,"Staying here for week in order to visit a friend located nearby. Very pleasant staff in all areas and only too willing to help. They supply two free shuttles in the hotel vehicles per day which is very useful. I stayed b&b and the food was varied, well cooked and kitchen staff cooked your eggs to order. Other meals can be ordered off the menu at other times of the day. There is free hot drinks and snacks, fruit etc. 24/7. My room was comfortable and cleaned each day. The air conditioning worked perfectly and quietly. Cool in the evenings so I used the heat setting. All in all, a great little Hotel. On a bus route too which is handy. I should mention, there is a bakery a little further up the road called Zorbas. Pastries to please everyone.",Asty Hotel
50,"OK Maybe not the swankiest hotel, good and clean, close to the centre, and they offer a fantastic service which includes:Free coffee, drinks, snacks nibbles 24 hours.Free taxi service, and pick up ( Andreas found a very good local restaurant, when our 1st choice was closed, and took us there, we walked back by choice)Free bicycle hire, with hats vest and lock.Gym, crazy golf...We would go back to this hotel on next visit, and recommended to friends visiting next week.",Asty Hotel
40,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights and it is a good sign that if we went back to Nicosia we would stay again. It is quite old-fashioned but what it lacks in modernity it makes up for in other ways.Location – it is a good 20 to 25 minutes walk to the city centre so we didn’t bother.It could be done but it isn’t a particularly nice walk along busy main roads through residential areas. One of the great things about this hotel is its shuttle service which you are allowed to use for two journeys per day. This is a great way of getting into town or they even took us to the racecourse. You phone half an hour had to get them to pick you up and it works very well.Rooms – we had one on the front of the hotel with a lovely balcony. It had two chairs and a table and we spent a lot of time on it. Other than that, it is quite basic but still very comfortable. The bathroom had a bath not a plug so we could only use the shower! Nice toiletries are provided and there is a television, safe, kettle and so on to make your stay comfortable.Food – breakfast is quite basic but still has a good range and enough to set you up for the day. Eggs are cooked to order and there are hot and cold items around the place. The coffee is good, not so the orange juice. A nice touch is that they leave a lot of things out through the day so you can help yourself to a snack or hot drink.Wi-Fi – really good. could stream video and use the Internet all over the hotel free for unlimited devices.Noise – we were at the front of the hotel and there is a busy road that so we did get some. Rooms at the back may not be as exposed but I don’t think they have balconies. We used earplugs and my final and slept well.Staff - not over there if you needed them to attend to any of your needs.There is free parking at the front of the hotel or in the car park at the rear. There is also a crazy golf course on the fourth floor but we didn’t use it.",Asty Hotel
40,"What a thoughtful hotel! I wish I could have stayed longer. The common room is an unexpected delight, with a coffee/tea/chocolate machine available all day, and access to a fridge with milk and fruit, and even “Cyprus” delights. There are plenty of comfortable spots to sit, and a charging station! There is also a business center, gym, games room, and book exchange. The breakfast buffet was expansive for a do it yourself place, with about 10 kinds of dried fruit, and real granola/muesli! You also get made to order eggs and bacon/ham.The room was clean and spacious and comfortable and quiet. It didn’t have a lot of character, but was fine. Amenities are basic.I can’t say much about the location as I didn’t explore, but it was not far from the old town, and they have a free shuttle to take you there and pick you up.Excellent value for money and a great place to make your base for exploring.Let me know if this review was helpful. Thanks!",Asty Hotel
50,"Great hotel just minutes away from the old city. And they have a shuttle that takes you and picks you up from just inside the old Venetian walls.Good breakfast with plenty of options and eggs cooked to order.The staff were all very helpful.The room, as all the rooms in Cyprus we stayed in, was small but comfortable. But we also only stayed in the room to sleep as we were there to see the sights.Our room was very quiet. The lobby was a great place to hang out, have a drink and check emails as they have free wifi.",Asty Hotel
50,"What a wonderful experience it was to meet the owners , family and staff of this fantastic example of a well run hotel. Nothing is too much trouble . Our room was very comfortable with a decent sized balcony. Very good breakfast was on offer every morning 06:30 to 10:00. There us a nice social area , a games room with gym . A self service laundry with ironing board. Bikes ate available outside. Two free shuttle trips per day to transport you in and out of the centre of Nicosia. They gave crazy golf on the roof if that interests you! The hospitality is outstanding at this great hotel. Thank you to everyone xx",Asty Hotel
50,From free day time snacks to free shuttle bus and bicycles this place supplies the lot all in included in a very good price. Just had m first night here and there really is nothing to find fault with. The staff are super friendly and helpful the location is great for the various Embassies [my reason to be here] and there are a number of really nice restaurants close by. Enjoyed the place that much we decided to book an extra night. One huge surprise was how peaceful and quiet the place was in spite of the very busy area it's situated in. It won't be the last time I/we stay here I am sure.,Asty Hotel
50,"The Asty Hotel is a quiet hotel, reasonably price near the city. The hotel offers free on site parking as well as a very good breakfast. Fruits, drinks and snacks are available 24/7 in the dining area.The Asty offers free complimentary shuttle, 1 round trip, per day, to the city center. This was great as we did not have to worry about parking. The shuttle driver picked us up within 3 minutes of request. On return, we contacted the hotel and the driver was there within 5/6 minutes.Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend.",Asty Hotel
40,"Nice, very reasonably priced hotel close to Cyprus museum (20 minute walk). This is a hotel that genuinely cares about its guests - little touches like free coffee, book exchange, free shuttle show that. Parking is available and free. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious.",Asty Hotel
50,"Very nice and clean hotel.Very friendly and helpful staff.Breakfast perfect.Fruits,drinks and snacks u can take all day and night.Room nice and with everything what you need.you can use gym.Very quite place..I like it and I will back always when I come to Cyprus",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed in the Asty hotel for just one night, but it was a very nice night! The hotel room was very clean and large! Very Mediterranean as it was white with blue trim! The bed was comfy and I couldn't hear any noise from the street outside. The staff was very helpful and they provided a shuttle to take you downtown! The only thing was I didn't have a working phone to call them to pick me up so I ended up having to take a taxi back! No big deal though! I really enjoyed staying here and would stay there again if I went back!",Asty Hotel
40,"Stayed here for 10 days in November when my husband was in the American Heart Hospital undergoing a triple heart bypass. Everyone was really helpful and friendly. I was taken to he hospital every day via the free shuttle service provided by the hotel. The room and facilities were really good, although I didn't spend too much time there as I was at the hospital during the daytime. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. Very good value, friendly, good breakfast and central to Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed at the Asty for two nights. I had a clean, modern room. Breakfast was very good with a hot and cold buffet. Asty Hotel is conveniently located very close to the town centre. The best thing about this hotel, however, is the staff. They were kind, helpful and attentive. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Thanks again for the lovely time!",Asty Hotel
40,"Very good for overnight stay. Helpful staff - one of them very funny with anecdotes about Cypriots being first people to invent wine! Room was simple but comfortable. Bathroom a little worn-out. Free coffee, tea, fruit, etc. available in dining room.",Asty Hotel
50,"What a wonderful experience we had here. Close to the old city, breakfast in the morning, shuttles to where we needed to go. Staff at the ready to help us with whatever we needed. We enjoyed our stay here, all necessary amenities you need for a long trip. Shuttle came right to hotel and took me to beautiful beaches and back with no problem. Thank you to the staff at the Asty for making our first trip to Cyprus a memorable one!",Asty Hotel
50,"Twas my first hotel in Cyprus. I had a great time staying in this hotel. They had a great service. The manager greeted personally on my arrival. They have an indoor gym and what i love i the most is they have self service laundry which most traveller needed so. Great breakfast and filling too. Unlimited snack access (I love the plums) :D. They also have 2 free transport service going and back from the city center. They accommodate almost every request. Oh this hotel have library, computer rooms and meeting rooms. Great meeting new people here too. 'εντάξει' is the first Greek language i learned here (the manager taught me that). Anyhow i had good night sleep everyday. Love the little balcony outside my room. I do recommend this hotel because of the distance to the city center and all the complimentary convenience they had.",Asty Hotel
50,"Asty Hotel is located 1-2 km from the city center. It is a relatively small hotel with a simple, yet good standard. The service was outstanding. The hotel offers a Shuttle service to bring guests to the centre, or to other Places. Although the official deal is two trips per room, they did not charge for extra trips.The service was outstanding.",Asty Hotel
50,"My wife and I stayed overnight in Nicosia - we had business yesterday and this morning. Great place to stay, excellent staff, convenient for the city centre, very competitively priced!We were warmly greeted at reception and advised that we had been upgraded to the Zebra suite on the top floor. In the evening we used the hotel's free transport to and from the centre of Nicosia - it was still very hot (in the upper 30s)On our return we got ourselves a cup of complementary coffee and the owner came and spoke to us and brought fresh chilled watermelon to help us cool down.This morning we had a cooked breakfast to set us up for the day.We'll certainly be staying at the Asty again.",Asty Hotel
50,"Good travel experiences are more often about the people you meet, than the places you've seen. Nicosia offered us both. We were warmly welcomed by the Asty's Receptionist, Andreas and given a quiet, non-smoking room at the rear of the hotel - as requested in our booking. It was light and spacious and had a great shower over the bath (best water pressure I've witnessed in many years of travelling). Sadly my mattress had seen better days, I rang Reception and within 15 minutes I had a replacement mattress and couldn't have been happier.Our first night's dinner was a few minutes' walk down the road at the neighbourhood taverna. Simple fare, good service and Cinnamon Ice Cream on the house! Don't bother travelling into the CBD if you arrive late afternoon/ early evening.The Asty's owners, Michael and Bobbie really know what guests require when travelling and have created a home from home. They were often in the lounge area themselves: open to have a chat with the guests: my Mum loved discussing the Embroidery Bobbie was working on.An ample buffet breakfast fuelled us for the day ahead plus there was complimentary Tea & Coffee, sweet treats, fruit and even Rice Pudding in the communal fridge incase we were peckish - just as you'd hope to find in a relative's fridge.Asty's complimentary Shuttle Bus Service dropped us in and out of the city centre each day, then delivered us to the Bus Station for our return journey to Paphos. Michael, his family and staff really do welcome you as if their own family. Don't be put off by the Asty being a little bit out of Nicosia's centre - if you require a good night's sleep and a warm welcome it's my recommendation.",Asty Hotel
50,Very nice service... Good value for money!!! We had a free upgrade to the Zebra Executive Room and it was amazing!! The hotel is very close to the center and offer complementary breakfast.Definitely recommend,Asty Hotel
50,"Very warm welcome from owner on arrival, rooms spacious and clean, we had rooms on the top floor, very quiet. Tea and coffee in rooms, and free snacks and beverages all day in the restaurant. Free shuttle bus for guests in and out of town, everything was perfect. Great Taverna just down the road which was a bonus. Large choice for breakfast. will stay here again, highly recommended.Thank you to the staff for friendly service.",Asty Hotel
50,"We only stayed one night, but it was a very relaxing stay. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the hotel is clean, comfortable and quiet. 24/7 free snacks & drinks in the dinning room, as well as tea & coffee making facilities in all bedrooms, along with a fridge for your own use. Breakfast was a hot & cold buffet with eggs cooked to order.Bedrooms were very comfortable and quiet, I was upgraded to the Zebra Room which was very spacious, with a sitting room as well as a large bed and en-suite shower room.There is a free shuttle into the main city and also free bicycles too. A great place to stay if you wish to explore the city, do some shopping or even on a business trip. Highly recommended and will certainly stay again.",Asty Hotel
50,"My English is not the best.:) Sorrry.Location in quiet district of Nicosia, near the center. Every day we could use the hotel taxi for two journeys. Most often in the morning we drove to the center and we called in the evening to get us back.Very nice and sly service.By midday we had to leave the rooms. We only had a plane from Larnaca at night. Without any problem, we received a free room (free of charge) for luggage storage until the evening, when in other hotels our friends had to pay a lot. Besides we could stay in the hotel cafe and have free coffee and eat everything that was available in the dining room. We felt very well there. I would recommend this hotel. Thank you!",Asty Hotel
50,"A small and quiet hotel with friendly owners and helpful staff. All the spaces are clean The rooms are spacious and renovated with all the amenities a guest needs ( WI-FI , TV, air condition, refrigarator, hair-dryer, safe box,kettle for instant coffee/ tea). The coffee at breakfast excellent.I recommended it.",Asty Hotel
50,"We didn't use the free shuttle, the free bicycles, the library, the computer or fitness rooms or need to borrow a GPS but we enjoyed the excellent location (it was very convenient for our needs) and the free tea/coffee/juice/snacks that are always available. The room was spacious and, to my wife's delight, had a bath......but, unfortunately, no plug!Breakfast was very good with a choice of hot & cold items. Eggs cooked to order (but not poached) were also available. The WiFi was good and fast, perfect for watching TV via the internet (there is only one English news channel). The room also has a small fridge which was very useful. The room has air conditioning, vital for the hot months. Parking outside was straightforward which is reassuring in a city hotel.The owner found time to have a chat with us which was most enjoyable.For us, it ticked all the boxes and was (at €59 inc breakfast) excellent value for money.We will certainly stay there again although many dates are already fully booked!",Asty Hotel
40,"Very clean large rooms with balconies. Check- in is efficient. There are complimentary juices, rice pudding, jello and other snacks available all day. Also, there's a coffee machine for espresso, etc. The cost is reasonable, & it's located in a quiet neighborhood. Disadvantage for tourists is the location away from the main area. A free shuttle takes you there, and we took a taxi back although we were told we'd have a return shuttle, but it wasn't available. We were happy to stay at Asty.",Asty Hotel
50,"This is a great hotel! By this I don't mean that it is a luxury, no holds barred, place for the rich. It is a great hotel because it achieves its goals: an excellent, modern, clean, well run budget hotel for the rest of us. There is nothing to complain about the management: we were given a free upgrade, and every question or issue we raised was quickly answered. The breakfasts are excellent, and a wide variety of food is available. In addition they have mini golf on the fourth floor, an exercise room, and free bikes. We were not in Nicosia long enough to avail ourselves of these amenities. The only downside is that it is not in downtown Nicosia; however, it provides free shuttle service to downtown and all around Nicosia. All in all, I could not recommend this hotel more highly!",Asty Hotel
40,"The hotel is out of the city center but provides a free transportation to the old city. Anyway it is just 25 min on foot. The room are well equipped, sufficintly large. The pillows are comfortable though in some rooms the mattresses are very hard and worn while in others they are very comfortable and sufficiently soft.The location is quite.Breakfast is excellent, while snacks and drinks are provided in the dining for free 24h a day.The downside: smoking smell in some corridors, from time to time penetrating the room, though no smoking is allowed in the rooms.",Asty Hotel
20,"this is an old hotel that needs renovations and not the lobby or the salons but the rooms also...rooms stings, bathroom tube was problematicstaff very very helpfull and good breakfast free coffe 24 hours..",Asty Hotel
50,"The location is good due to the excellent drop off and pick up service which means the city centre is easily reached. The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean Breakfast is good and the freshly cooked eggs a real bonus. The complimentary snacks and drinks available through the day and evening were really appreciated. The ability to bring a take away back and have in the dining room means that visitors flexibility throughout their stay. We had read the reviews befoore we booked and can definitely agree with all of them. If staying in Nicosia, why stay anywhere else especially for the price charged it is excellent value.",Asty Hotel
40,"I spent 2 nights at Asty Hotel. It is so close to American embassy so people who have appointment in the embassy can easily access to it just by minutes of walking. Staff are so friendly and willing to help in any matter. Also the breakfast was great and satisfying . There is a nice local restaurant called Tavernaki near the hotel, I ate Pork Kebab which was so delicious and nice lamb chops!In case of transportation to Larnaca airport they could arrange a van to pick you up for 11 Euros.All in all It is a highly valuable hotel comparing with the money you pay.It is probable that I visit Nicosia one more time and I am sure that I will stay at the same place again.",Asty Hotel
50,"Wow!I was impressed. I book a single room in Asty for an overnight sleep and a shower.I checked in late, 9pm and given a beautiful executive room.It was amazing. Oversized comfortable bed. A large lcd tv, free WiFi mini fridge, complimentary water, coffee and tea making equipment, air conditioning and a bathtub with basic shower gel and shampoo.I really loved the decoration and everything.What could you ask more?",Asty Hotel
50,"The only disadvantage of this hotel is that is a bit off the city centre, but they manage to rectify that problem immediately, by offering a free shuttle service (twice daily per room) to the city centre. They take you right away and bring you back anytime you call the reception. We chose this hotel because we had a rental car and Asty hotel offered free parking right in front of the hotel.The rooms are clean, we got upgraded to an executive suite for free, which was very kind of them. The breakfast is good, plenty of options to choose from. The bar area is open 24/7 and guests can have water, coffee, tee, juice and even alcoholic drinks complimentary, free of charge.Everyone is very nice and helpful. The customer service is exceptional in Asty Hotel. I decided to book it according to very good reviews and now I can recommend the same. It's really a great value for one's money.",Asty Hotel
50,"Although it's a ** hotel,it offers all the services of a **** hotel. Everything was great at this hotel from staff,rooms,food. I recommend this especially to those who have visa appointments at us embassy. It's less that 10 minutes walk to us embassy.",Asty Hotel
40,"Stayed here for a night during my 4 days trip to Cyprus. The room was big,clean and the staff was very helpful.As other reviews mention, there is free shuttle service to and from the city center.It isn t very far you could certainly walk but there is nothing interesting for a tourist on the way. ( they would take you and pick you every time you called the reception to request their shuttle services). The breakfast offers everything you need to get you started for the day.( free snacks and fruits are also available throughout the day). A good hotel in an interesting city.",Asty Hotel
50,"Come and go, the staff always make feel at home. The staff are always ready and helpful to the customer. Back in Lebanon now, I still am in touch with some of the Asty staff members. They make you feel at home and become beautiful friends. Always my choice every visit to the Island of Aphrodite...",Asty Hotel
50,"SHORT STORY: You want 4 star treatment in 2 star cost? Go stay here!LONG STORY: Free pick & drops daily (just call & inform your location). Free fruits, desserts & drinks 24/7. Free bicycles at your disposal. Family run & hospitable staff. Comfortable rooms with all amenities provided. Location not walking distance from Old City but Free pick & drops solves that problem.",Asty Hotel
40,"I stayed here for three nights and it was great. Lovely comfortable bed in a quiet, clean modern room. The breakfast was fine and they lay on a shuttle on demand to take you into the town centre but you can walk it in 20 minutes and is very easy to find.",Asty Hotel
30,"Due to the great reviews on here decided to book the Asty for an overnight stay. We knew from the reviews to expect basic, and indeed it was. We didn't experience the warm welcome that others appear to have, maybe the guy behind the desk was having an off-day.The bed was so uncomfortable, a double but two single mattresses shoved together and about 6 inches off the floor. The bathroom on the surface was clean, not so good if you took a closer look. The shower curtain was stained brown probably just due to being very old. Our friend in the room next door had real difficulty getting her door to lock but had a comfortable bed so at least that was something.Breakfast was actually fairly decent until we saw the waiter smoking in the kitchen, maybe the done thing in Cyprus but not very hygienic.The Asty served a purpose however we would definitely pay the extra to stay elsewhere in future.",Asty Hotel
50,"It is a very good hotel in terms of location ,services ( shuttle bus) reception, cleanliness, breakfastI enjoyed staying in Asty hotelI feel relax and at homeI recommend that hotel to stay inI selected it based on the high rating of reviewers and it is true",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed at the Asty hotel while touring Nicosia alone. I found them very gracious and accommodating. Upon arrival, I received a free upgrade to a top level room with a balcony and the staff even pointed out to me that (as a single traveler) I was eligible for a cheaper rate than what I had originally thought (which was already very well priced). The manager and all the staff were very friendly and eager to make sure I was satisfied with my stay.As other reviews mention, there is free shuttle service to and from the city center (Solomos Square, where the main bus center is), which I made extensive use of. They took me where I needed to go in the city center and were willing to come pick me up with a phone call once I was at the designated pick-up spot (Holiday Inn Nicosia City Centre, if I recall correctly). I also very much enjoyed the complementary breakfast, which had an excellent selection, and the in-the-room WiFi worked perfectly, without any problems. I didn't make use of the free bicycles, but I appreciate that they were there. There is a piano in the downstairs lobby.The main potential drawback to the hotel in my case was location (as most of my activity was near the city center) but the free shuttle service made up for that. There are also two city buses that pass near the hotel. If you need laundry done, there is a laundromat a few blocks away, very walkable. So don't let the location be an impediment.",Asty Hotel
50,We stayed at this hotel last second. The hotel staff was amazing at accommodating us. We found a great room at an amazing price. The WiFi is super fast and the air conditioning blew ice cold air. Every night as we explored the old city we took advantage of the shuttle service or the complementary bicycles. I would stay here again for sure!,Asty Hotel
40,"We stayed at the Asty for two nights for a local wedding.The hotel is a little dated but makes up for it in the service it provides. The variety of what was on offer at breakfast was great, with complementary beer and hot drinks available throughout the day. The rooms were clean and well-presented, though our bathroom had some issues with smells coming up from the drains.Only downsides were the location is a little bit out of the way, and the hotel staff were not responsive to emails/contact before the stay. This was significantly improved during the stay, but I felt that the days leading up to our arrival might have been less stressful had the hotel been better at responding.On the whole I would definitely recommend.",Asty Hotel
50,Can't express how amazing the service was. It's really great when visiting a country for the first time that the first few people you meet are beyond welcoming and caring. The breakfast was to die for and I love that they had a shuttle service. Which even took me to my first day of uni!,Asty Hotel
50,my husband and i stayed at the Asti for a few days at the beginning of our trip and a few at the end of our trip in Cyprus. The staff and owner were so accommodating and friendly it made our stay so comfortable. You can get a shuttle to the centre of town or to the grocery store which was so convenient! Our last room was the Zebra room! totally recommend! Bring wash cloths though...seems like there aren't any hotels in Cyprus that have them :-),Asty Hotel
40,"A bit dated hotel, but it is a good mile from the old city centre. Free shuttle bus to city centre. We went across to Northern Cyprus for 3 days, free parking offered at hotel for this period. Very helpful staff with regards to sightseeing and the closest supermarket. Definitely well worth the room rate charged (£50 -£100 / night)",Asty Hotel
40,"We stayed here in order not to have to drive in the narrow streets of the old city. The offer of free shuttle service to and from the old city is great. The surprise was how large the room was, along with a large bathroom. It is furnished simply and breakfast was also good. We had a nice view from the large windows in our room. There was also a balcony, but it was too windy to sit there. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We would stay here again.",Asty Hotel
50,"The best value we have ever encountered in a hotel! Not a luxury hotel, but it has ample and quiet rooms, excellent air con (needed in June - Aug), super friendly and accommodating staff, and outrageous amenities: full breakfast including eggs to order, homemade jams, cheeses, meats, juices, yogurts, cereals, breads ...24 hour self service for coffee, fruit, yogurt, milk, cereal, rice pudding - amazing!! The owners are so friendly and accommodating - they treat you like family. Free shuttle service up to twice per day to/from the Old Town. We're thinking of returning to Nicosia just to stay at the hotel again!",Asty Hotel
50,My husband and I stayed at the Asty for three nights this week. We cannot praise the hotel and staff enough - every one was very friendly and helpful. We were upgraded on arrival at no extra cost. The hotel is extremely clean and well run and 24 hour snacks and drinks were lovely. Spoilt for choice for breakfast. We are looking forward to staying again over the next two weeks.,Asty Hotel
40,"The Asty Hotel in Nicosia I have never been to. However as I type my parents (in their seventys) are staying at the hotel as it is near to the Oncology hospital where my father is having daily treatment. My mother is a keen clean freak some would say she has OCD, therefore finding a spotless place is difficult the first thing she did was check the pillow - spotless. Not a fault to be found. Regarding the staff - They can not do enough for them anything is possible, my father's diet is limited and yet they have gone out of their way to accommodate their requirements. Polite, friendly they two can not be faulted. The food is plentiful and delicious according to my mother - last night they had a free BBQ. If you need somewhere to stay in Nicosia this is it. There is easy transport from the hotel and they also have tourist information to hand. I can not thank them enough they have taken the worry of driving back and forth from home away and now my father can concentrate on recovering.",Asty Hotel
50,"We had only a few days in Nicosia the last few days of May, and were fortunate to stay at the Asti! We were treated like family! The room was great. Any questions we had were answered right away, and the service we received was wonderful. The breakfast in their breakfast room was a great start to our day, and there were refreshments available 24/7. We spent some time in the old city, and were able to arrange rides to and from there with the desk. When we had some down time (in the early morning, and late evening), we were able to use the balcony to just sit and relax. All in all, we would definitely stay here again if we ever come to Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
50,"The receptionists are very friendly. I remember mostly Christel and Abu Karam and an old man who works the night shift. They would help you out in anything you need with a smile. The rooms are well kept, the lobby is comfortable, and the area is calm.",Asty Hotel
50,"In general, hotels in Nicosia are not as good as those of other 'tourist' cities such as Limassol. In Nicosia you are very likely to pay a lot to stay in an average hotel. But Asty is different. Facilities are not very new, its because, according to a friend of mine, this hotel has been running for decades. But everything is clean. There is free parking at the back of the hotel. The location is not 'super' central, but Nicosia is a small city, it only takes about 20-30 minutes walk to the Old Town. I was there on 1st January, the hotel was making free souvalkia (barbecue) for its customers. Staff are helpful and friendly, they can help you order delivery if you can't speak Greek well. =)",Asty Hotel
50,"We only spent one night at the Asty hotel ; a stopover in Nicosia before going to the north. In that brief stay we were treated with enormous kindness by the receptionist, staff and manager. The room was clean, comfortable and calm. The restaurant prepared a lovely meal for us outside normal hours. Most memorably, we were driven into the city by the owner so that we would not miss out on its world class museum. Nothing was too much trouble. This is a real gem of an hotel run by genuine people who understand the concept of hospitality.",Asty Hotel
50,"Simply the My Hotel Choice in Nicosia. Came back to it due to a school reunion. The hotel is located in a peaceful area in Nicosia. The staff members are really one of the best around. Always happy, friendly and sociable with their customers. Anything you may ever need, the staff are always available to assist you and to help you. They know I will always check in to the Asty on every visit I make to Cyprus. With a gym located underground and a mini gold course located on the roof, and bicycles available for anyone who wishes to ride around the city. it really is a great place to stay in. Always my selected choice...",Asty Hotel

40,"The receptionists at the Asty were just wonderfully friendly and helpful. It was so refreshing to find folk who seemed to take pleasure in supporting our needs - without expecting further payment!The room was fine, with a lovely big balcony. It was clean and functioned as expected, although I couldn't say it was anything very special. Good value for money though.They have bikes for guests - free to use - and a minibus to transport us wherever we needed to go in Nicosia - free to use again.Breakfast was not the best, but then we didn't pay much for it. There was great choice, but..............the cooked breakfast was badly prepared and presented.The lounge area and 24 hour access to free coffee was wonderful. Would I stay here again.Yes, I would.",Asty Hotel
50,"Yes, ok it is a bit out of town but, for us, that's a good feature as the area is quiet so sleep quality was great. We upgraded to an executive room that had a balcony and a sitting area so I thought that the room quality was good too. Plenty of hot water, clean, snacks and drinks when you want them all free. There is always a lift in and out of the main area and the people are lovely. Will definitely stay here again.Hint - the executive rooms aren't listed on some of the booking agency websites so it is better to phone the hotel if you fancy upgrading.",Asty Hotel
50,"This must have been built in the 60's or 70's, the architecture and furnishings reflect that period in a positive way. Staff are friendly and helpful, although the hotel is two km from the center they have shuttle vans and will haul you here and there for free. Rooms , beds, and bathrooms are comfortable. You can have full English breakfast or go continental, or both, it's included in the room rate, which is excellent value. The only negative, a small one, you can't drink the water from the tap in your room. They supply a free bottle of water. Good WIFI, free parking.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed overnight at the Asty hotel which is a 25 minute walk from Ledra Street and the old centre of Nicosia. On arrival the booking was efficiently completed just using my passport. The staff in the hotel were pleasant, happy and helpful. I have seen it described as 'the family' hotel and that is what comes across. The hotel is spotless, has a fresh feel and yes it is a little old, but and a big but it is comfortable and not tired. The shuttle transport to and from the hotel is readily available, they will drop you off anywhere in Nicosia and pick you up and it's free. There are drinks and fruit/ snacks available 24 hours a day in the lounge and again they are free. Breakfast has a very good selection running for 3 and a half hours. Eggs cooked to order. An ideal hotel for people wanting to explore Nicosia. Plus at €40 a night for a single room including breakfast a bargain.",Asty Hotel
50,"The Asty Hotel Nicosia was recommended to me and it turned out to be an excellent choice.Very clean. Twenty four hour service. All night coffee machines and snacks included as well as breakfast. Fridge in room. All the usual things like tv, kettle, tea & coffee, hairdryer toiletries.Courtesy mini bus to where we wanted to go. Staff very kind and helpful. A pleasure to stay in this family run hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"Our second visit to this very friendly family run hotel. Breakfast is of a high quality and good selection of how you would like your eggs, cereals, and cold cuts. Parking is at the rear or in front of the hotel and free. There is a shuttle service supplied free by the hotel to take you into the old city of Nicosia. Rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious.",Asty Hotel
50,"Asty Hotel is like a second home for me. Every time I am in Nicosia I stay there. This time again I stayed for a few days there. The staff is always so helpful and warm. I got a ride back and forth wherever I wanted to go somewhere. The hospitality was unbelievable. The breakfast in the morning was rich and varied. When I ordered an additional meal, it really felt being at home- It was so delicious.The room was very clean and was cleaned every day. Every request was immediately answered. The place was quiet. It couldn't be better. There are stores around if one wants to get food, for example. The price was great. Worth every cent!!",Asty Hotel
40,"We stayed there for 8 days during Christmas, Dec 2015. This is a family run motel. Very clean and friendly staff. The place is about 2.5km from downtown. To the left, about 100metres is Zorpha's bakery that sells nice pastries and cakes at reasonable price. A further 50 metres walk is a laundrette that washes clothes for about £2 per kg. To the right of the hotel are 2 taverns, one Cypriot tavern and the other Syrian-Arab Friendship club that sells yummy meze. At the hotel, The buffet breakfast in the morning is a nice spread. There is free flow of hot beverages, (proper Tchibo coffee), juices, jelly,fruit, rice pudding and filtered drinking water all day. Also, at the front desk you can ask about the car hire company that they do deals with at cheaper rates and also hire a GPS. The staff will drop and pickup the hotel guests at any destination in Nicosia. We didn't get to use the bikes being winter and the roads tend to be a little narrower in Cyprus. Only thing is the room can be a bit noisy as the hotel is at the main road and smell of cigarette smoke at times even though it's non smoking area.you can ask for a room change. Also, the bathroom is very small but clean. The hotel staff are really friendly and on Christmas Day, to our surprise, invited all the guests for a traditional Cypriot BBQ and food, free of charge. It was nice to stay at Cypriot family run motel. We will definately stay at this hotel again if we are in town.",Asty Hotel
40,"What guided us to Asty Hotel was the policy regarding the pets. We were allowed to have our small dog with us in the room. The hotel was clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The breakfast was very good as well.During the day we were allowed to have free drinks in the lobby and ofc free wifi everywhere in the hotel.The only thing we didnt like was the smell of the room probably they have varnished the wooden cover of the walls.But in general, definetely value for money!!!",Asty Hotel
40,"B&B with an en-suite WC/shower for 43 Euros per day (in January) for two people sharing a room, with complimentary tea, coffee and juices, among other things without limit, is incredible value. Most of the staff were friendly, but one man at one reception one evening was grumpy. The accommodation is simple, and it is reasonably comfortable and clean. The en-suite bathroom in room 213 desperately needs a make over, as the fittings are old, and the walls and floors not very pleasant. It is definitely budget, rather than luxury, accommodation, but there is a kettle in the room, and you can take up what you wish to make from the dining room downstairs. Only polystyrene cup are provided in the bedroom, but there is nothing to stop you taking up cups or glasses from the dining area downstairs. Face flannels are not provided. We asked for a room with en-suite bathtub, and had an email saying that this should be possible. Although we had an en-suite bathtub, no plug was provided, and reception would not provide one (apparently to save water, but as the other two hotels we stayed at in Cyprus with a bathtub had a plug, we found this to be a weak excuse). We found ways to block the plug hole, and had a bath anyway! Breakfast was satisfactory, but nothing special. The 'hot' food was tepid, as there were no lids to the receptacles they were kept in. The free wi-fi was very slow at times, making it next to useless at these times. The other main drawback was that the hotel is a 25 minute walk from the town centre, and situated in any area with few restaurants and no bars. The hotel does provide transport to the town centre, which can be useful, but is not ideal. Free car parking is provided. The staff who clean the rooms are heavy smokers, and leave the non smoking rooms smelling of tobacco.",Asty Hotel
30,"A family run Hotel - staff were diligent and pleasant. To be honest it's great value just to get your head down for the night, but ' no frills attached'. It felt a ' little transient' The room was ok, with coffee / tea facilities, TV and hairdryer ( no bath plug) .Staff were helpful, but in the main a little ' distant'Breakfast was plentiful.",Asty Hotel
40,They put as in a very lovely room and as we requested late check out they agreed kindly.The only problem in the room was that the a/c was a little noicy.Nice breakfast but not much variety.Quite place nice for family,Asty Hotel
30,"We stayed at this hotel because it is pet friendly. The common areas of the hotel are vey good and clean. Pets are also allowed on common areas. Staff and owners were very friendly and willing to help. Thr room was a bit dissapointing, we stayed at 1st floor and the room had a bad smell and the furniture were very old. I believe that with a renovation in rooms this hotel can be much better.",Asty Hotel
50,Thank you to all the wonderful staff and owners of Asty who made this holiday so memorable and enjoyable. From the comfortable bikes to the outstanding Christmas meal to which all guests were invited this hotel is just amazing. Transport to and from Nicosia and advice on where to go and places to visit all made this trip special. The delicious buffet breakfast is a great way to start the day. Biking in and out of Nicosia and exploring old river pathways is the best way to explore and enjoy this diverse city. The best view of the mountains is from the top floor bedroom balconies.,Asty Hotel
50,Second time around and it was as good if not better than the last time. We were treated to a wonderful Christmas feast on Christmas day. The friendly staff really make you feel at home. They go above their duties and with a smile. I believe it is excellent value for money. I will be back😁,Asty Hotel
20,"We had high hopes given the rating on Trip Advisor and the comments but this did not live up to the hype.  The common areas in the hotel are nice and the breakfast is very good.  However, the staff were much less friendly than advertised.  On check-in we found that we had a tiny room with a lot of taffic noise outside and noise from the room next door was noticeable.  We knew exactly when and for how long our neighbour used his toilet!  Our own bathroom was the tiniest I have seen - see photo.  The booking agencies state the room type is 23 sq metres but ours was a fraction of that.  We asked to move room but the man on the desk said they were full for both days we were staying.  There was no offer to do anything or help in any way.  The room was a smoking room despite our request with the booking for a non smoking room.  The whole corridor smelt very strongly of smoke despite there being only two nominally smoking rooms.  When we asked for a lift to town, an advertised service, it was provided in such a surly and unfriendly manner that we were made to feel quite uncomfortable.  In summary I think something is very wrong with the current ratings.  We checked into another hotel in the centre of town as soon as we could - a little more expensive but definitely worth it.",Asty Hotel
50,"Basically, Asty hotel will be my only choice in Nicosia.Nicosia isn't big but public transport is bad, esp you need to go to the other side of the border.Impressively, Asty hotel arrange shuttle anytime to entertain every guest. Also, You can serve yourself with food and drink anytime in the kitchen. Staff is nice and i can feel that they serve every guest wholeheartedly.",Asty Hotel
40,A flying visit to Nicosia and I had followed all the recommendations onTripAdvisor. Given how strongly it is rated perhaps it was always going to disappoint a bit. The rooms are quite spacious and clean. The people I encountered working there were all friendly and helpful and the breakfast was good.,Asty Hotel
40,"We live in rural Cyprus so a trip to Nicosia was a chance to see ""city Life"". This hotel is about 3km from centre but provide an amazing all day courtesy transfer service. They also do free coffee,tea juices all day,free internet even with use of their PCs,fab breakfast and such friendliness.5 minutes walk from two Meze houses and in a pleasant area where walking is a pleasure.spent most of first day walking city walls which is still a divided city but full of amazing places.Best of all off the beaten track Cypriot hospitality is still to be found and wonderful.",Asty Hotel
50,"The Asti is superb. We have now stayed there twice, the service the room which is the Ethnic room is superb the staff are amazing and cannot do enough for you. Breakfast is fabulous and they even cooked us eggs at 6.30 in the morning prior to us going to the hospital and despite the fact the restaurant does not open until 7 am. The 24 hour free drinks (not alcoholic)is very nice, so we were able to have tea and coffee or soft drinks whenever we wished. The lift to the hospital was unexpected.we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, 2 star it is NOT more ,like 4 star.Thank you to Mr Michael and his staff we will be back but not I hope for the hospital.Barbara and Ian Paphos",Asty Hotel
50,"Probably the best hotel in Nicosia. It literally has complimentary everything, including free coffee all day long and a taxi service to and from the old city.If you go to Nicosia and can get a good deal for this hotel, I strongly recommend it.",Asty Hotel
50,"Ordinarily I would stay in Starwood or Branded hotels but the Asty popped up as no1 on Tripadvisor, and so I took the plunge. What a fantastic experience. Having arrived by intercity bus from Larnaca, I decided to walk the 3km with my luggage to the hotel. I was 5-10 mins walk away from the hotel when Mr Michaels drove up in the Asty branded car and offered me a ride. That excellent customer service continued throughout my 2 day stay. The family provide snacks, tea, coffee and juice et al for free; you just help yourself. The breakfast is excellent where they will make eggs to order. The large shared space has plenty of sofas which encourages you to engage with other guests. It's 20 minutes walk to the old city but it's pleasant, and safe. If you don't want to walk - the family will drop you off and pick you up. Rooms are comfortable. My advice - ditch the large hotel and come and meet the Michaels family. You won't be disappointed.",Asty Hotel
50,We stayed at the Asty for 1 night . An easy 45 minute drive from Larnaca Airport and no more than 5-10 minutes drive from Lefkosia Old Town.We had the Zebra room - large with interesting decorations and super clean . Comfortable double bed and good shower . Balcony with a view across the surrounding suburb . Area has a number of embassies and consulates.Free wifi in hotel and in room . It is fast thanks to routers on every floor .We used the free bikes to cycle around the neighbourhood and to our nearest Costa Coffee . You could cycle into the Old Town but we did not have the time as a very short stay . About 20 minutes and bike could be locked in the the council car park just inside the city wall .Breakfast included and parking .Staff extremely friendly and helpful . Thank you to Kyrio Kosta for all his assistance .Thank you to Michael for taking the time to locate accomodation for us in Polis area . He searched the Internet and made the booking and a follow up email to see if anything was alright .We would definitely stay here again when in Lefkosia . The fact it is not within the walled city is not an issue .,Asty Hotel
40,"I stayed at Asty hotel for four nights travelling for business. The hotel creates you the feeling that you are staying at your house. Always friendly people ready to serve you and to help you. Although it is not a luxurius hotel when you check out you think that you was staying at a big,expensive hotel.",Asty Hotel
40,"Asty personel were very friendly and kind. They have a shuttle that drops tourists to several spots and picks them up when we call which makes it much easier to stay at the Asty since it is about 10 minute drive from most places and not so easy to walk to Ledra Street where much of the action takes place. One of the best points to staying here is their delicious hot breakfasts; the eggs are cooked to your liking. The office staff are all very friendly and courteous. We had good hot water in the bathroom, a small refrigerator and a small terrace although below is a neighborhood street that was fairly uneventful. For the price, this is an excellent option for those visiting Nicosia, Lefkosia.",Asty Hotel
50,"A great hotel for business trips in Nicosia! The common areas need renovation for my taste but who really cares if the rooms are clean, up to date and modern? I would suggest to everyone to check in Asty Hotel!",Asty Hotel
40,Stayed here during my visit to Nicosia back in March and it was nothing but great. So glad I decided to stay local and not at one the big name hotels. This hotel provides everything that you need to be comfy and have an enjoyable stay. The hotel offers an inclusive breakfast for guests and the owners and staff are very friendly and helpful. The shuttle service is really handy to get to the main transit stations if you don't feel like walking. I'd definitely stay here again - it's close enough to everything and be sure to make use of the bikes they have available for guests!,Asty Hotel
50,"I had heard about this family managed hotel and that's why I chose it. But I never imagined it would create such a loving ""home away from home"" for me. Michael (the owner) and his loving family and staff made my stay very pleasant. My airline had lost my luggage and Michael made them return it overnight, before my next day meeting.The constant FREE availability of hot and cold drinks, snacks and fruits and a very cozy lobby made my stay very pleasant and comforting. The FREE shuttle to and from different locations create a very reliable means of transportation for first time tourists.The FREE Wi-Fi system in the rooms and lobby never failed me and I am grateful for that.I will definitely stay there if I get the chance to return to Nicosia. I highly recommend staying at Asty Hotel for anyone and everyone who seeks a family environment and much care and attention during their stay.My most sincere thanks to Michael, Menalaos, Bobby, Andreas, Margarita, and Chrystala and everyone else at Asty hotel whose names I dont know, but their kind smiles, I remember.",Asty Hotel
50,"The overall experience was great. I would definitely come back again. Highly recommended for people who are visiting the city for the first time as the guidance given was excellent. Very clean, spacious room, amazing breakfast and convenient location, as it is located in the heart of the city.Once again, wise choice if travelling for a few days to the capital of Cyprus.",Asty Hotel
40,Breakfast and snack and juice through the day was complementary which I thought was great! Can come down and grab a tea/ coffee / juice really late at night. (No drinking water in rooms) It was also really clean and good air con in the rooms. Happy stayed here,Asty Hotel
50,"- perfect location especially if renting a car. has own parking and it's close to main road going around nicosia- very friendly staff- kitchen area open 24/7 where you can have snacks, drinks, coffee etc for free all the time.- they have shuttle van/car that can drive you to any location around nicosia when you need- we got the zebra suit which is one of the best rooms...just wish we spent more time in it as it's really nice, clean and not just a hotel room to sleep...but great to hand out at!TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!",Asty Hotel
50,"As a travelagent I am the most critic person to judge a hotel. I visite the best 5* star hotels in the world but the Asty hotel in Nicosia is the best local human hotel I have ever seen. This 2* hotel is runned by a sympathic family Michael and Margarita and the staff is as good as family as well I believe. Rooms were clean,large enough, airconditioning,good bed and nice bath/shower. Breakfast was great, eggs baked as you wish,the fridge with fresh fruit and drinks for free when you want. On request they will go and buy some fresh fish and they cook it for you in the evening if you want to eat in the hotel.Hairdresser and lovely restaurant in front as well . Bikes for free to use.Wifi works perfect everywhere in the hotel ans very easy to use, no complicated registrations. Wifi, click and done!The free shuttle was the cream on the cake because whenever you want they will drive you till the centrum of the town which is +- 3 km away. We calles and there they were Always with the biggest smile. And believe me the 6 strong Cyprus girls as we were called were not the easiest clients I think. :)Nothing was too much and the prices for the hotel are crisis economic prices for everyone.Next year the Belgan footbal team probably plays again against Cyprus on 6/9/16 so we will be back and we will bring 20 new guests to the Asty Hotel for shure!Only few things to concider Michael and Margarita:pillows on the terraschairs, more afterdrinks in the bar like Amaretto or vodka or Irish Coffees and maybe some large French fresh bread to cut with the breakfast.perfect organisation",Asty Hotel
50,"Had two nights at the Asty during our recent visit for the Wales v Cyprus football match, and there were a fair few other fans who had made the same choice. The shuttle service to the city centre was vital to help us get around, and they would happily get one of the staff to drop you down when you needed to go into town.The breakfast was good, and bacon and eggs is a start to the day that I have rarely found in hotels at this price. There is also a range of pastries, toast and juices available, along with cereals.The rooms aren't much to shout home about, but for a hotel offering affordable rooms like this, the faults are easy to overlook. Mattresses are a little bit hard, but the air conditioning was a godsend to someone like me who isn't usually too fond of the heat!A great hotel, and the owner Michael and his family were extremely welcoming, and I can understand why so many people feel this hotel really does deliver.",Asty Hotel
50,"Every visit to Cyprus I make, Asty Hotel is more than a home to me. Staff are friendly and wonderful, Hotel is located near the American Academy Nicosia (My School). Simply my favourite place to stay because of the beautiful cosy atmosphere. On top of that, it's close to all my childhood friends. Love it and Love it's staff...",Asty Hotel
50,"Just got back from 5 days at the Asty Hotel with 4 mates. Hotel is a bit dated but clean and comfortable. Breakfast was included in the price and was reasonable. The management and staff couldn't do enough for you so much so that I felt the need to write my first ever review to complement them on their outstanding customer service. they don't have a swimming pool, so I am not sure if I would take my family, however there is a public pool which was very nice in easy walking distance and only cost 6.50 euros. For couples or groups travelling without children looking for a somewhere to lay your head for a couple of nights, i couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.",Asty Hotel
50,"We spend our first night in Cyrpus at the Asty Hotel. We arrived very late at night but had no problems to do the check-in. The recepcionist even arranged something for dinner for us. The room was very clean and nicely decorated, we enjoyed it very much.",Asty Hotel
50,"This hotel is amazing! The location is about 5 minutes from the downtown. The staff are so friendly and helpful!They have really good wireless connection. The rooms are so great, especially the zebra one :) they have free shuttle service, so you can ask the driver to drop you off anywhere you want within the city.They have free breakfast, free fruits 24/7, free drinks :) this hotel is a paradise for those who want to save money and stay at a really really nice place!Not to mention, gym, table tennis, free bikes!",Asty Hotel
50,"Stayed here for 6 days. The place has everything they say it has and then some. The room was not special, but it was clean and had all of the expected amenities, etc. The breakfast was really good! The breakfast area also has a sandwich bar so you can make yourself something for later in the day, and they make these cup-sized portions of jello and yogurt that are stored in an accessible refrigerator 24-7 along with various chilled teas, fruit juices, and sliced watermelon.They advertise a shuttle service. I did not use it pre-stay, but I was taken from the hotel to my apartment free. Very nice staff, very nice owners, and last but not least, surprisingly good wifi!",Asty Hotel
50,"The room was neat and appropriately sized. The AC was great for the hot Nicosia Summer. The location is very convenient to go to the Engomi Mall, the downtown, or the universities. The #259 bus goes from the same street to both ends of Nicosia: The university of Nicosia, and the University of Cyprus, which are in opposite directions.The Hotel's amenities are great. Open buffet breakfast with several options. Choice of fried/scrambled and boiled eggs, and free 24/7 availability of cereals, milk, juices, melons, lemonades, coffee and water in the restaurant area.The Hotel provided free bikes to anyone who wants to go cycling in the city.The Hotel provided us free shuttle rides to anywhere in the city.There was free wifi available on all the hotel's premises.They also have a gym (didn't try it). Billiards (Didn't try it), MiniGolf (Tried, not bad) available for free.For a 2-star hotel I felt I paid much less than deserved (45 Euros for a Twin room, basically 22.5 per person), and got a lot out of it. The shuttle rides alone saved me at least 50 euros!",Asty Hotel
40,"This hotel is excellent value for money, not too far from the city center. very clean and air con in the room. It isn't a 4 star but you get excellent service and nice touches like various fruit and drinks free 24 hours in the restaurant area.The staff first rate and apparently (although I didn't use the service) they have cars to pick you up or take you FOC). As I say it isn't 4 star but excellent value for money, I paid about £70 for 2 rooms with a very good breakfast included - would thoroughly recommend. equivalent to a Premier Inn in the UK but a lot cheaper.",Asty Hotel
50,It is a good hotel. They deserve a complement for the service they provide compared to the money they take. They will pick you up to anyplace you want free of charge. The are friendly and will do anything to make you happy.,Asty Hotel
50,This family-run hotel is super price/value option - you will get 5-star services for 2-star price. Friendly and helpful staff is always ready to help and answer your questions. There is also a free transfer service for hotel guests. Highly recommended!,Asty Hotel
50,"I had a nice room with balcony! Hotel offers free bike rental and shuttle transfer services to the center (walking distance from the center is about 25 min). Coffee and drinks available 24 hours, wi-fi is good and everywhere. Perfect rice for value!",Asty Hotel
50,"Excellent room, very clean, very polite!!! Breakfast and everything in the kitchen was free of charge. They even gave us a free room update upon arrival.They provide free parking space.

40,"We stayed at the Asty hotel for three nights and were treated to great breakfast every morning, free shuttle to and from the city center and a great colourful retro style room. The staff were very friendly and the property is very well kept for its age. Plenty of chilling out areas and the coffee/tea and fridge were open 24/7. We loved it and would definitely be returning.",Asty Hotel
40,"I stayed here two nights, arriving early evening from the airport in Larnaca. They checked me in, provided some background info about the hotel and Nicosia and provided maps.I don't know if all the rooms have a theme, but mine was the Zebra room. All the fabrics and decor mimicked the black and white stripes of a zebra. A fun design. The room was of good sized with a separate bathroom with a shower. It was clean, quiet and comfortable.They provided a shuttle to the city center where most of the restaurants and shops are concentrated. The shuttle goes when you are ready to go, not on a set schedule. It would be a long walk but was a short drive. They told me the shuttle would pick my up when I finished, but it got to be past the 11:00 shuttle deadline, so a took a taxi back, which was inexpensive.The next day was sightseeing. The hotel staff were very helpful in planning my day and again provided a shuttle to town.There is free WiFi in the hotel. I had no problems getting connected in the lobby or in my room.I was impressed with the hotel and its imaginative decor, and I felt it was a good value. The staff did everything they could to help and make me feel welcome.I would recommend it to others and would stay there again.",Asty Hotel
50,"It is what you need!!Safe, Hot water, nice bed, excellent WI/FI, quite, very good breakfast, Low cost, close to the center - they also have their own buses for customers! - well equipped gym, it is really the most convenient solution in Nikosia.I am a frequent traveler in Nikosia, so I had the opportunity to stay in all type of hospitality structures, but I finally find out the most nice and convenient Hotel in the area.It is an old fashion hotel, but this gives to the hotel a character of relaxing and easy going atmosphere.The restaurant is open for meetings 24/7, and they offer without any charge fruits, coffee, juices, sweets etc at any time of the day or night!Personnel is also excellent!! Friendly and supporting too much!",Asty Hotel
50,"nothing to complain at all, many freebies, free shuttle, family-run business, fresh fruits all day long, were upgraded to a color executive room, quite area. it's like a 5 min drive into the old town. just give the hotel stuff a short call and your location...",Asty Hotel
50,"We only stayed for 1 night but the hotel was great, staff helpful, and rooms were a good size and clean. We left very early in the morning and they were very accommodating event such a late hour. It was exactly what we needed for a short stay. The free shuttle to city centre was great as well.",Asty Hotel
50,"I got married in Nicosia a few days ago and i had booked several rooms for me my, friends and family. The whole staff was really polite, helpful and always there to check if we needed something and if we were happy with our accomodation. The rooms were spacious and clean with airconditioning and nice bathrooms, A very nice service provided by the hotel was the free lift, to and from the city center, by the hotel's mini buses. Another interesting and pleasant surprise was that there were two fridges with fruits, yogurt, juices and other snacks that you could get for free 24/7. The breakfast was rich and tasty.It is definitely worthwile to stay at this unique family hotel. You will have an amazing stay!",Asty Hotel
10,The manager was very rude. The prices are inflated and extremely variable. The location is awkward and the room smelled strongly of paint fumes and the bathroom like drains/sewage. Would NOT recommend this hotel.,Asty Hotel
40,"This hotel has a personal touch with friendly, helpful staff. It is conveniently situated with ample parking and the free shuttle bus to and from the city centre is a real bonus. The offer of freshly cooked eggs to accompany the cooked breakfast was a welcome addition. We will definitely be staying here again and will highly recommend to all our friends.",Asty Hotel
50,"Although we only stayed here for one night, we could have happily stayed for many more as the service was incredible!The family could not do enough for us and arranged a free shuttle bus into town for whenever we needed it which was a great help as driving through Nicosia would have been a bit of a pain. We also ate at the hotel and the food was fantastic and very cheap.The room itself was very nice and exceptionally clean with all the facilities you could require (fridge, air conditioning, wifi etc).All in all a fantastic place to stay at a very reasonable price.",Asty Hotel
50,"I had stayed in the hotel for two weeks. I was impressed by the friendly atmosphere that I encountered in these two weeks. I really appreciated the politeness and the hospitality of the staff. Furthermore, I was satisfied with the facilities and the services that were offered. Despite the proximity to the centre of Nicosia, there was a shuttle that was driving me over there at my time of my convenience during the day.",Asty Hotel
50,"This family run hotel in Nicosia is not your modern box in the sky, where customers are just another face in a day's business. From the very start, this hotel and its staff differentiated itself from most hotels we have stayed in.We were flying in from Antalya, Turkey into Ercan airport, in Northern Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus-TRNC). I emailed the hotel asking about how to get from Ercan airport to the hotel. I got a prompt reply from the owner, Michael, telling me that if we telephoned the hotel after we had crossed into the Greek speaking side of Nicosia (Republic of Cyprus), they would happily pick us up (free of charge) from the Ledra Palace crossing point. Once over the crossing, we called the hotel and they picked us up within 5 minutes.We stayed at the hotel for three nights. Our room rate included breakfast. The breakfast included breads, cereals, sliced meats, cheeses and choice of eggs cooked in various ways - hard boiled, fried, scrambled or omelette. In the dining room, there are two hot drink machines providing a variety of drinks. There were also other cold drinks - milk, juices, flavoured waters, and yogurt, rice pudding, and a couple of desserts such as gateaux. All of the above are available free, 24 hours a day: you just help yourself.The hotel also has some hand held GPS units that you can borrow for the day, on a first-come-first served basis. There are also about 8-10 bicycles you can borrow. All of the above are provided free of charge.There is also free WiFi in the hotel with excellent coverage - no dead spots. This is because they have basically implemented a Wifi network on each floor. To use the WiFi you need to connect to each network to maintain Internet access, but this is not a major problem because you basically only use it on the floor you are on, the lobby and the dining room.The hotel staff will drop you into the Old Town and they will come and pick you up if you call the hotel: again, free of charge. We found that even if we were just standing in the lobby, the staff would come up to you and ask if you needed a ride somewhere. The transfer service runs from 0700 to 21:30.Our room was clean and comfortable. We had the room with the 12"" muti-coloured wall tiles and the multi-colored toilet seat, which made sure you started your day immediately you went in the room :)There is also a fully equipped fitness room in the basement, which we didn't use. There was also a table tennis table down these and a foosball machine.While the hotel is an older building, it is well maintained throughout, and our floor (3) had recently been completely repainted.When we left the hotel, they dropped us off a few metres from the Ledras (Lidras) Street border crossing; they recommended this crossing point because they knew we needed to get a taxi on the Turkish side back to the airport. After crossing, we found a taxi right away at the end of the street, so we did not have to hunt one down.All in all, I was very impressed with the hotel, and I felt it was good value. Most importantly, Michael and his family and staff did everything they could to make sure all our needs were met, and they provided lots of good advice about things to see and do in Nicosia, and reasonably priced places to eat.We would have no hesitation about booking the Asty again, and we will recommend it to family and friends travelling to Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed in the hotel couple of days in September 2013. They gave us ZEBRA ROOM- the most special room i ever stayed in.The service was great, all day buffet, free transportation to the centar of Nicosia, free bikes.All in all everything was more then GREAT.",Asty Hotel

50,"This was a great choice. Very helpful owners and extremely comfortable. Michael will organise anything you need. Not sure why people say it isn't close enough to town as they have a shuttle bus to anywhere in Nicosia. They will drop you off and pick you up from restaurants. Free refreshments including tea coffee, cold drinks and deserts. Also plenty of spaces to sit and relax. Loved our stay, thanks Michael.Sonya and Michael.",Asty Hotel
50,"My family have stayed in this hotel recently, the staff are very helpful and friendly. premises are well maintained and very clean, rooms are very beatifully decorated. The breakfast was prepared immediately and delicious.It is situated conveniently and accessible to all other amenties. it is truly a family hotel and excellent value for your moneyHad a great time",Asty Hotel
40,"I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at the Asty Hotel. The room was clean, fresh set of towels every morning, plenty of hot water, free bottled water, free internet and breakfast was included. The staff was quite but helpful. My receipt was missing some information when I noticed it back in the states. I contacted the Asty hotel and they were quickly able to assist in emailing me a copy of the information I needed. Overall great stay for the rate!!",Asty Hotel
40,"My colleagues and I stayed at the Asty for over a month while working in Nicosia. The place was lovely with the team constantly making sure we felt comfortable as though it was our own home. There was a satisfying breakfast (eggs prepared especially for you, breads, spreads, cereal, fruit, juices etc), and the dining room open 24/7 with some food, staff ready to help and a microwave to warm up your own food. We didn't try the lunch and dinner that were offered but used the shops nearby. There is also washing services walking distance away. There is a bus stop (infrequent) near the hotel, but not many places to go out to around. Rooms are spacious, nice and clean, not luxurious, with cable TV and Wifi. The hotel has many pleasant areas to socialize / study / relax as well as a gym and nice balcony. There is always someone to advise you about where to go, what to do in the island, and a small van to take you there. On holidays they held celebrations and we were invited as part of the family. Thank you Liana, Regina, Enagis, Margarita, Michael and family.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed 6 overnights at Asty. The hospitality, the service, the rooms, the facilities, the warmth of the peoplethe food, -everything was just perfect! Every request is immediately answered as well as every question.It is possible to order a meal even in the last moment at night and they will cook for you something.Don't think twice!!",Asty Hotel
40,"We recently stayed overnight in this hotel because my wife has treatment at Nicosia Oncology Hospital. We have stayed in a few hotels in Nicosia for this reason, this hotel is head and shoulders above the others we have stayed at.We checked in and then we were shown the facilities, there is a dining -room where coffee, tea, hot chocolate, juice and fruit is totally free 24hrs a day. this is a really nice touch. The hotel also has free wi-fi throughout, it is a good strong signal as well. the hotel has a free shuttle bus to take you anywhere in the city, they also have bikes for hire at no charge. There is a good Taverna within ten minutes walk of the hotel, the food is good and the atmosphere also good. There is a Pharmacy next door and a bakery across the road. The hotel also does meals if you require it, cannot comment, as we did not use this service.The room we stayed in was excellent, large, clean and very airy. with a lovely balcony and good view over the city. The bathroom was also excellent and the shower provides a really good hot shower.The bed was large and very comfortable, room was quiet at night, we had a really good night's sleep.There is a good quality free breakfast each morning with a good variety of food, eggs, etc which are cooked to order.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Nicosia, and all that for 45 Euro's, excellent value for money. Well done Michael, the owner.",Asty Hotel
50,"The hotel itself is just perfect, and that's why the ***** rank is for. Room is clean and cozy, great shower, beautiful view from the balcony, very good sleeping quality. Service is above and beyond – free wifi everywhere, free shuttles to anywhere in the city (including the airport bus stop), free late check out, tasty breakfast with juice, coffee, tea and fruits available for free 24/7 – and all that for less than 35 euros a night!The one and only problem is the location – it's in residential neighborhood with nothing to do around it, about 20 minute walk from the city center. Bus service end pretty early on the weekend, and you have to ask call the reception that someone will pick you up (which they gladly do). If you travel by foot be sure if that is what you are looking for. If you rent a car – that is the perfect place.",Asty Hotel
40,We stayed in this hotel for one night four couples and a child. Hotel was clean and the breakfast was very good considering the price was excellent. We would recommend and go back again. Basically it is what it says on the tin no frills but excellent value and the staff were very nice,Asty Hotel
50,"I came to this place after one month trip through Caucasus and Iran and simply it was a culture-hotel shock for me :)Super clean in a nice peacefull location with very good English speaking staff.There was 8 of us divided in 2 rooms - stayed for 2 nights.I guess most of the review mention that you have :* Clean rooms and toilets* Spacious rooms with TV, hairdryer, balcony, good beds* WIFI working superfast on all floors* Great variety of breakfast, big buffet and plenty too choose from* Free bikes - whenevery you like, as much as you please! Excellent for a solo or a group tour to old city which is 20 minutes by foot or 10 minutes by bike.* Free shuttle bus to the city / bus station, and since we were 8 they did it with 2 cars* Good information desk, even some free magnets to choose* Big common room where you can chillAnd for this price probably the best value hotel i ever stayed. Deserve 10 stars if you ask me :)",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed 1 night here before a conference and really enjoyed my stay in this family run hotel. It is slightly out of town but this is more than compensated by free pick up from airport shuttle station. As I was on my own they then insisted on driving me to a local restaurant and collecting me again. Room was big, spotlessly clean on ahigh floor with a balcony as requested. It's a family run hotel and they were welcoming, friendly and did all they could to make my stay enjoyable.Thank you very much.",Asty Hotel
40,We enjoyed our stat at this efficiently run family hotel. Because it is out of town the free shuttle bus is excellent and the owner and his wife drove us to our preferred destinations within Nicosia. Our room was spacious and with balcony and nice décor. The shower room was bigger than most hotels. The breakfast was adequate and good value. And the complimentary all day drinks and snacks an added bonus. The hotel is far away from shops and restaurants. There is only one restaurant nearby which we dined at several times and had excellent food.,Asty Hotel
40,"It's hard to find a hotel in Nicosia that is far from the city - everything is a few minutes drive. Perfect hotel for doing business in Cyprus, professional, great value and friendly staff.The rooms are not exceptional but one of the better standards in the area.",Asty Hotel
50,Stayed for two nights. Although the hotel is a little dated the facilities etc. make up for it's downfall. There are free bikes and free courtesy bus. If walking into Nicosia it takes around 20 minutes. The staff are all very welcoming and friendly.,Asty Hotel
50,"Hotel location is not in downtown, but hotel offers free shuttle within Nicosia(07:00-21:30) and free rental bicycle. It takes approx 15min from the hotel to downtown by bicycle.I called the hotel when I took an airport shuttle from Larnaca airport to Nicosia, then hotel shuttle was waiting for me at the bus terminal. It's free of charge.Free coffee machine, soft drinks are offered anytime at a restaurant.Wifi works without any problems and hotel room is clean.I recommend to stay at this hotel!",Asty Hotel
40,"I enjoyed my 2 days stay at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and supplied me with maps and valuable bus information. The room was spacious and clean and had coffee and tea available. It was quite near the border crossing. (It cost 6.5 euros for taxi from ""Girne"" or 'palace' border crossing from Northern Cyprus to Hotel.) The hotel has many good bikes with locks for free which was fantastic as It is about 3 km from the old city. The open breakfast was good with a variety of fruit and drinks and meats and cheeses. Nearby a variety of fast food restaurants and cafes and second hand clothing shops. Free shuttle service into town offered by hotel to the bus station. Very nice place to stay especially if you like biking and exploring. Free wi fi and good air conditioning.",Asty Hotel
30,"We stayed only one day at Asty , in general it was good. A very possitive element is that the hotel is pet friendly, and we stay with our dog. Staff was friendly , the room was clean . the only negative is the old furnitures, it should be renovate.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed in Asty hotel around new year and loved it! Words are not enough to express my great experience that I had there.I have been in many hotels and this hotel is more than GREAT.It says 2 stars, BUT MUST BE RE-STARRED TO 5 STARS!!!Starting from the room, as I read previous comments and did not expect much-it was actually lovely room, on the last floor, unlike the wrongful comment I read about the water pressure-it was very good, no problems at all. No noise as I read from another comment- cleaners were coming to clean midday and all was good and a high quality in any aspect.Very important aspects were that there was a fridge in the room and an air con which also contributes to the pleasant stay. There were in the room tea, coffee packets, and water bottle, and the hot drink packets were topped up on daily basis as well as toiletries. All was clean and nice,really pleasant to stay there. The hotel staff were really lovely, helpful, friendly and pleasant which is vital in regards to contribution to a good hotel and a nice stay. I am especially grateful to the hotel manager - Margarita- she is a great asset to the hotel, was ever so helpful,friendly, smiley, very professional and always there for the customers like myself.The breakfast was very good and tasty, and there is a buffet with a variety of things, I really liked the omelette, the traditional biscuits, and other tasty things like the rice pudding. There are hot and cold drinks always available as well as other things, which is really helpful and nice. If one does not want to use the free bikes, like myself-one can walk to the town centre as I did- approx.35min on foot, so this is also lovely in regards to location.For New year's day, I received a lovely invitation as everyone else staying in the hotel for a free BBQ, drinks and a whole buffet lunch,all was free and was fantastic.There is also free wifi in the hotel, the wifi connection is very good not only inside the room, but anywhere else inside the hotel- that was very, very good and handy.It was my 1st time in Cyprus and Nicosia, and had a really great time due to all the fantastic experience at the hotel. I highly recommend it to anyone.",Asty Hotel
50,"The hotel is a bit oldish, but the service is excellent, breakfast is abundant and they offer bike rentals and 24-hour snack buffet. On a hot summer night you need a refreshing juice and a little snack every hour, and it's all there. For low-budget and fit travellers it is a good choice.",Asty Hotel
50,"This hotel has included everything I want, and no extras I don't need. Free bike rentals, decent morning breakfast, 24hr access to tea/coffee/snacks/fruit, good internet, and a friendly atmosphere. For the value, it's unbeatable!! We have stayed twice now, and twice been 'upgraded' to a large room with balcony and good sized bathroom. It's a little 'dusty' in that the place is quite old, but it's clean enough and the beds are very comfortable. The 'hangout' living room area is very pleasant. For all that and at that price - 5 stars!",Asty Hotel
40,"I stayed in the Asty only one night. I was with a group of people traveling through. The hotel was clean but shall I say, spartan? I can't comment on the location other than to say it was not within walking distance of any historic sites. There are a number of bakeries close by and those are fun. Breakfast was included with the price and that was tasty. Served quickly and efficiently. There was a large selection to choose from. The front desk was efficient also. A clean hotel. Nothing special.",Asty Hotel
50,"If you are looking for a luxury 5* hotel with swimming pool, spa and a doorman, this is not it.This is ranked #1 on TA by the many patrons that have stayed in the hotel as we have experienced true hospitality and value from the kind staff at Asty.The hotel is not too near the touristy old market (not an issue for us as we have rented a car - and there's plenty of parking at the back of the hotel, and a couple right at the entrance if you're lucky), but comes with so many other frills that it more than makes up for it.There's unlimited WIFI (I could only detect it at the common hall and not in my room but that is not an issue as there's 24hour free drinks and refreshment at the common dining area).There's a free to use pool table, table tennis table, gym, board games, dart board, kid's slide and some toys at the basement. There's also free to hire bicycles at the entrance.Most importantly, Asty has really nice staff who all seem most happy to be working at the establishment. We would go to the breakfast table and have a nice gentleman come readily to us to ask how we would like to have our eggs for the day. When we had takeaway for dinner, a kind lady who seemed to be on standby at the dining hall asked if we required plates or serviettes.If you're looking at a place to stay in Nicosia, this really is the place to be.",Asty Hotel
40,"we stayed at Asty hotel in the begining of December 2014. the hotel seems to be quite old but the staff take care of it and keeps it clean. I think whats stands out the most and I would give them 5 stars for it is their attitude. there's food at all times of the day that all guests can enjoy, they have free shuttle service where ever you need in the city, they drop you off and pick you up where ever and whenever you would like. we were allowed to postpone the check out in 2 hours just like that. so, if you need a place to stay for a night or two it might not be the newest hotel but the service is all and more you can ask for.",Asty Hotel
50,"I liked very much my two-assigned executive rooms (Colours and Zebra). The buffet breakfast was diversified and quite filling for a day-long tour of Nicosia. The staff at the reception desk (Christalla, Asad, Costa), of the dinning hall, and the cleaning team were all efficient and friendly. The hotel is clean and quiet, and I enjoyed the beautiful view from my room's balcony. Above all, I like the hotel's shuttle system, whereby guest can be driven to the city centre for free and even picked up from the city centre when calling the hotel for a ride back. I really cannot say enough about my good luck in choosing this gem of a hotel. I must particularly mention the grace and hospitality of its owner Michael, who quite generously got up early on the morning of my departure to give me a ride to the Kapnos airport shuttle bus-depot at around 6:30 AM. Throughout my stay, I genuinely felt being treated like a friend or a relative. I am hoping to visit Nicosia next year and know for sure that I shall be staying at Asty.",Asty Hotel
50,"This hotel is simply amazing. We booked it because we had no other choice in the moment, but we were truly amazed with the facilities and staff of the hotel. Rooms are a bit worn out but everything is in a perfect working condition. Staff is friendly, breakfast is excellent and the hotel provides a FREE SHUTTLE from the hotel to the city center which literally saves you a lot of money!!All the best and regards to Asty.",Asty Hotel
20,The manager (owner) was promised to contact us for a special request and after three days of continuous request he never came back to us. Simply unacceptable.On top of that the linen needs immediately replacement.,Asty Hotel
50,"Very good and friendly place. Room is clean and quite comfortable. From our window we have beautiful view to the mountains. They always have something sweet for guests on the kitchen) Also there are bycycles for use, but unfortunatelly no place to ride. It's not far from the old city - 20 min by foot.",Asty Hotel
40,"My husband and I were on a sight-seeing trip to Nicosia and were delighted with our stay at the Asty. The staff were very friendly and helpful - especially Mr Michael - and they are all a great asset to the hotel. We accepted the offer of the free shuttle bus transfer to and from the old city and found this a very good service as the location of the Asty is further out of the city, but we knew that when booking. Our room was a good size and very comfortable. The breakfast was cooked perfectly,to order and there was plenty of choice as far as we were concerned. The extra facilities the hotel offers also make this an easy hotel to recommend to stay in and for value. We would definitely stop again.",Asty Hotel
30,"So dreary. A lifeless, lost-in-time atmosphere, with plastic food and grumpy staff. The location is miles out of the town center.On the positive side, the beds were reasonably comfortable, and the bathrooms clean and quite well equipped.I'm sure you could find somewhere more fun for a holiday.",Asty Hotel
50,i stayed in asty hotel for second time in three months is a great hotel .very clean good prices helpful and friendly staff.for sure if i have some job to do in nicosia always i will stay in asty.i would highly recemmend this hotel to anyone who want to stay in nicosia for a few days,Asty Hotel
50,"Stayed at the Asty four four days on business and the hotel couldn't have been better. Ideally located for all of our meetings.The hotel has thought of everything from the bikes, to the umbrellas to the complementary refreshments throughout the day.We couldn't have asked for more, and will definitely be using the Asty again when visiting Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
50,"We stayed three days in this hotel, with very helpful and friendly staff.We had the possibility to rent a bike for free, or to use the hotel shuttle bus services, also for free, also the possibility to drink a coffee or a tea, or eating a fruit, 24 hours on 24, for free, in the dining room of the hotel.This is a very good place to stay for a visit a city full of history, and a blend of cultures Greek, Turkish, Venetian (Italian), English.",Asty Hotel
40,"I was looking for a hotel in central Nicosia which would be convenient to visit the old city and visit some of the key attractions like the Cyprus Museum with my son, who had flown out from the UK.Using Trip Advisor I learnt about the Asty Hotel and read some of the positive reviews from previous guests. They convinced me to choose this hotel and I am very pleased that I made that decision.The hotel is excellent value for the accommodation, breakfast and the use of a fleet of quality and well maintained bikes.The rooms are, understandably for the price, simple but clean and well maintained. The breakfast was excellent and a good start to the day. We made use of the bikes to explore the old city.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to explore the centre of this historic city.",Asty Hotel
50,"Having read the mainly glowing reviews of this hotel, my wife and I booked a one night stay at the Asty. After parking at the rear (well signposted) we were greeted by Mr Andreas who showed us the dining room and pointed out the (free) tea/coffee/juice etc. and fruit and other snacks which are available 24 hrs. He explained that the buffet breakfast was open from 0630.Our room - indeed, the whole hotel - was spacious and spotlessly clean. The beds were very comfortable and we both slept well - the neighbourhood is quiet considering its proximity to the centre of the city. We were very pleased with our accommodation - it is simple and basic, but it's very comfortable.The breakfast was excellent - we had eggs and bacon. There were vast choices including a number of cereals, breads, olives, cheeses, cold cuts, dried and fresh fruits etc. There were even green tea bags on offer! Somebody has put a lot of thought into the ""breakfast experience"".The hotel is located on the western side of Nicosia in Ayios Dhometios (which was perfect for us) and is NOT far from the fascinating old city. When we walked out for dinner we were hailed by the friendly hotel shuttle driver who asked where we wanted to go!All the staff were very friendly. The price equates to incredible value for the product offered. We're so happy to have found this establishment after a previous unpleasant experience elsewhere in a Nicosia hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"The Hotel is actually not exactly in Nicosia but in Ayios Dhometios,i think 3-4 km. form the centre of Nicosia, it was not easy to find it when i arrived. So it is not close to the center but the hotel offer free shuttle to the center whenever you want and they pick you up also whenever you want, or alternatively you can pick up one of the bike of the hotel for no charge, the option i used more as it took only few minutes to reach the centre and it is nicer and easier to visit the city with the bike, you can use it also to visit the turkish occupied side of the capital.When i arrived they gave me a room that looked nice but that it was clearly not cleaned yet from the previous guest, when i told them they immediately gave me another one, that was actually an executive room, big, nicely decorated and very confortable.Wi-Fi is free and very good in all the hotel, whenever you want you can drink tea, coffee, juices and eat fruits cakes and sweets in the breakfast room for free. The breakfast is really good and with very good choice. There is also free reserved parking just attached to the hotel.Everyone is very nice and helpful in the hotel, really a good experience for me to stay there and i would recommend it really to everyone.Price too is very reasonable.",Asty Hotel
40,Clean rooms. Housekeeping staff great. Management very helpful with printing of flight bookings and organizing travel bus. Breakfast very dismal as was attitudes of kitchen staff. Great WiFi. Free Gym.... Would stay again.,Asty Hotel
40,"We stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting the capital. The staff are very friendly and there are lots of freebies including 24/7 free snacks and drinks, dre breakfast, free cycle hire, free shuttle bus, free parking and even free beer whilst sitting on the balcony. The rooms were to a good standard with an excellent choice of tv channels. This is a truly 'too good to be true hotel' but with no catches! Lovely stay!",Asty Hotel
50,A 2 night break from paphos for the sights. Wonderful service all the time and very helpful with suggestions and directions. Ring them when you get near as its hard to find . Had a great room (the colour room on the 5th floor) Breakfast was self service with eggs if you ordered them.Do walk down towards town and eat at the syrian friendship restaurant 5 mins turn right after the health centre. Use the free shuttle bus they will take you into town.Do cross over into the north as its a great day out. Good free WiFi.,Asty Hotel
50,We have just arrived and have been met by very friendly and helpful staff immediately upgraded as we are Welsh and cyprus is playing Wales in Cardiff tonight .we have hospital appointment tomorrow and have been given free taxi to and from have altered stay from one night to two and as we have to return again next month we will be conning back.Zebra suite is amazing and 24 hour snack bar is something we have not experienced elsewhereWhat a wonder find star rating should be upgraded,Asty Hotel
40,Good value hotel offering shuttle bus to centre hot and cold drinks and fruit available 24 hrs all at no extra cost will use again nothing was too much trouble plenty of choice at breakfast and good coffee machines.,Asty Hotel

50,"I am rather a Doubting Thomas when it comes to hotel reviews. So when I read the superlatives about Asty Hotel I hardly believed them. I stayed at the hotel yesterday and now I must admit I was wrong. From now on it will be my favourite hotel in Nicosia. No, it is not a five star hotel, it does not have a swimming pool or a spa or dancing monkeys, but it offers something more: they make you feel at home. And they are extremely friendly and understanding. When I arrived I found out that I had made a mistake and reserved a room for…. the next day. Thanks to Mr Andreas I was given the last available room (for three). The hotel’s décor is rather outdated, but the rooms are clean, the bathrooms quite big, the bed is comfortable, the air-conditioning works well. The towels are fluffy and smell nice and never before had I seen in the bathrooms brand new sealed sponges for all the people in the room. They even thought about installing European sockets! There are tea and coffee sets in the rooms, but they are not really needed as you are welcome to have not only coffee or tea, but also juices, fresh fruit, cookies and cornflakes all day long for free! As if this were not enough to make this hotel unusual, when I asked for a taxi in the morning they offered to give me a lift to where I was going in their hotel shuttle. And all this for a veeery reasonable price. They do deserve to be the tripadvisor's choice of the year! They are certainly mine!",Asty Hotel
50,When you book a hotel for this rate you just hope that it will be clean and quiet.This place is amazing. You will get the value of a 5 star luxury hotel!! actually you will get more then in a 5 star hotel. The family that runs place can write a book about the harmony and Zen of running a hotel.**Clean:The rooms are super clean. Sometimes in hotels the rooms smell of perfume or cleaning antiseptics but in this hotel there is non of that.**Quiet rooms:The Mattresses are top quality and are very comfortable. It is located in a very quiet neighborhood so the place is very quiet and we had excellent sleep conditions.**Location:They gave us a ride to the center whenever we needed so the distance from the center was not a problem at all and since they dropped us exactly were we had to go it actually saved us time.**Room design:The rooms are colorful and renovated.****Extra****Highly recommended hotel!! We visited here on April and were invited to join the family in the Easter celebrations. They took us to see the ceremony in their church and invited us and all the other guests at the hotel to an excellent home made barbecue and salad bar. All these extras were free of charge but where not just a promotional giveaway it was pure hospitality!,Asty Hotel
40,"Stayed many times here usually for one night . Its a great value for money accomodation. it provides all the basics above average for a very low price. Big celan rooms although outdated . Good breakfast . Again, thi is a great value for money option not a luxury hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"We were absolutely delighted with our one night stay at the Asty, especially to find we had the best room in the hotel, clean, comfortable, spacious, complete with fridge, water, tea and coffee facilities. We just wished we could have stayed longer. The staff are friendly, helpful and informative. We would have liked to have had dinner at the hotel but it needed prior booking and we were not that organised but there is a lovely restaurant a few metres down the road. Juice, water, tea and coffee are available free of charge 24/7. Would certainly recommend and use this hotel again.",Asty Hotel
50,"We stayed 2 night, three of us in two rooms. Both rooms were excellent, one front one back. both fresh and clean and comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful, which includes the Free shuttle bus into Town and back. Buffet Breakfast but with a cooked option, very nice.I would highly recommend the very reasonably priced Hotel and look forward to staying there again. The even helped me start the car, left for two days with the interior light on hence flat battery, nothing seems to be too much trouble for them",Asty Hotel
50,"Though not in the town centre, Asty staff went out of their way to drive us to the Kapnos airport shuttle, to the town, ordered our Cypriot souvlakis, picked them and delivered them at the hotel with a free beer.Another night Michael drove us to an Italian Restaurant and picked us up when we were doneWe highly recommend Asty",Asty Hotel
50,"Great one night stay. Staff helpful, provided a shuttle to the city centre for free. Nice touch juice and some snacks available all day in the restaurant. Breakfast choice was good quality for this class of hotel. Everything was simple comfortable and worked. You may want to stay closer to the old city but this worked well for me and my partner.",Asty Hotel
50,"I visited this hotel during my holiday in Cyprus with my family.Our hotel room was clean, the towels and sheets were fresh. Our room, had a great view of the terrace, with the golf court. We played once and we enjoyed it a lot.Only drawback was an indistinguishable bad smell in the room, sometimes.The staff was really friendly, gave us advice on what to do and where to visit.The fact is, that It is not a central hotel, so I believe that a car is needed. It offers free parking spaces in the shade, which is important in the hot Nicosia!The buffet in the breakfast was nice. A great variety of stuff, so that it fullfills all needs.Another positive aspect is the fact that it offers most of the breakfast delicacies all day long for free. The breakfast room was open to anyone and the staff often urged us to visit it for a snack!A great choice for a cheap but wonderful stay!!",Asty Hotel
50,"Like previous reviews we found this hotel to be excellent value for money. From the friendly helpful people at reception who greeted us like friends, to the obliging staff that dropped us off or picked us up from the centre of town, or the restaurant and kitchen staff that supplied us with an excellent breakfast, and fruit, coffees, drinks and snacks at any time of the day. We only stayed 2 nights but enjoyed every minute. Many thanks.",Asty Hotel
40,"I would suggested ti without any hesitation.Booked there 2 rooms for two friend couples. They were more than satisfied with my choice.Friendly staff, more than willing to provide them with any assistance (town instructions, providing them hotel transportation from and to the hotel). Something which impressed me was that the place where breakfast is served is 24h open so any time you feel you can go there and prepare smthing easy to make.",Asty Hotel
50,"The Asty Hotel is a very nice hotel, that is perfect for low budget travellers. It is about 25 minutes of walking away from the Nicosia City Centre, so if you don't mind walking or you're travelling by car, it will be the perfect choice. They did every favour I asked for, offered the breakfast the whole day and even have a shuttle bus that will take you wherever you need to go, to continue your travel.",Asty Hotel
50,"I arrived in the evening and was promptly picked up. On arrival I received a warm welcome and when I discovered my room I was gobsmacked. It was beautifully decorated and had a balcony. The cleanliness, the comfort and the location made me wish I could stay longer. The free shuttle, wonderful breakfast and little snacks were appreciated bonuses but what really made this place unforgetable was the staff's hospitality. They go the extra mile to make you feel at home. My improvised dinner from the local tavern was delicious. I will certainly come back and really recommend it to everyone visiting Cyprus.P.S: Larnaka is only 40 mins away on the intercity bus and the beach is lovely.",Asty Hotel
40,"Location: 1500m from Plateia salomou. You can go by shuttle (free) and come back on foot. There is an excellent taverna near the hotel too.Breakfast is fine and you can have coffe at any time of the day on the house!Rooms are big and clean, simple and a little bit outdated on decor but beds are confortable and bathroom is clean and with good pressure of hot water. AC works well.Staff is very kind and helpful and there is a good parking in the back of the hotel with some covered places for your car not tu burn in the or sun.They offer you bikes for free and the shuttle is a must.If you want to go to the north by car the crossing is quite near the hotel to the west. the access from the motorway from limassol is not so simple but quite linear.",Asty Hotel
40,"I spent three nights at Asty Hotel in a leafy part of Nicosia. Very friendly and efficient service and generous hospitality make this hotel distinctive than others in town. 24hours free drinks and delicious snacks were unusual and very convenient . Nice atmosphere, perfect price. Thanks everyone at Asty! I will be back.",Asty Hotel
50,"My wife and I stayed at the Asty hotel for over a month. During that time we were treated as members of the family. The staff were always cheerful, friendly and helpful as was Michael, the owner.The room was bright and cheerful and always kept spotlessly clean as were the public areas of the hotel.The cleaners were a credit to the hotel. There are covered car parking spaces at the rear of the Asty; Invaluable in the heat of summer and the rain of winter.The shower in our room was a good size walk in with good water pressure. Soap, shampoo and liquid soap were provided daily.The centre of Nicosia is a gentle walk away although there is a bus stop outside the hotel at a cost of Euro 1.50 each way.Breakfast was an array of cereals, bread, etc with a cooked option of 2 eggs, bacon, tomato and potato if you wanted it.In addition there are 2 coffee machines with a choice of coffees and 2 large fridges with yogurt, rice puddings, fruit, jellies etc available 24 hours a day free.Also free is Wi Fi which is available throughout.To summarize, the Asty Hotel is excellent value for money and is a credit to Michael, the owner.",Asty Hotel
50,"The Asty Hotel is a great place to stay if visiting Nicosia. The hotel is very reasonably priced, clean, and comfortable. We were given the Executive Color Suite, which is a large room with balcony and a good sized bathroom/shower. Our room was very quiet and the bed was comfortable. The room had heating and air conditioning. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was diverse and plentiful -- eggs (however you want them), cereals, yogurt, fruits, toasts, cookies, and more. Many of these items are also available during the day for you to snack on. The staff was VERY friendly and accommodating and treated us wonderfully. They have a weight room and game type room in the basement where we played pool one evening. There is also a nice terrace in the front where you can sit and relax. The Asty has a complimentary shuttle that will take you to various places WITHIN Nicosia once you get there. We had a VERY nice stay at the Asty and will definitely stay there again! Recommended with enthusiasm!",Asty Hotel
50,"Great hotel, they provide us everything a guest needs. We were very content to stay there. If Ill have d chance to visit cyprus again illl stay in asty hotel againnn. Very recomanded. Very clean rooms. With a great view, very generous in everything. Great breakfast, and the stuff was smiley face.",Asty Hotel
50,"We had a fantastic time at the Asty Hotel! We originally chose the hotel because of the inexpensive price per night (I suggest using Booking.com to get the best deal for this place) but it turned out to be way better than we had imagined. Included in the price of the room was breakfast, with eggs made to order, and a free shuttle to and from the center of the city whenever we asked. We had also rented a car for day trips to other parts of Cyprus and lucked out because Asty not only had free parking for us, but also a free GPS for us to use while we were traveling. They even provided maps and great advice on how to get places. We had a really great time and created a TripAdvisor account specifically to review the hotel. If you travel to Nicosia, definitely get a room at the Asty Hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"Every country needs an Asty hotel. Not only were the staff incredible, they had amazing service. The rooms are very clean, and have someone cleaning it daily. The breakfast in the morning was included and very tasty. The 24 snack fridge was a real bonus along with teh coffee machine. We had the best time at the hotel... and would return if ever in Cyprus again!!!!!!! Thank you for a great time Asty!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Asty Hotel
50,"This hotel was quite inexpensive, but only because it was not in the center of town. This was solved easily because they offered us a ride both ways whenever we requested! The room was lovely, nice and clean and quiet. We drove there and found it very easily. The staff were very pleasant and the breakfast was excellent - good quality and big selection. Highly recommended.",Asty Hotel
50,"We led a group of eleven people and had not one complaint about this hotel. I can't add much to the positive comments made by previous reviewers as we found the rooms clean and comfortable, the staff (family run) friendly and helpful and the extras (snacks, drinks, free WiFi and shuttle bus) a real bonus. We were only there for two nights but will definately return when we come to Nicosia again - it was also easy to find despite being in a capital city.",Asty Hotel
50,"Was so impressed by this hotel. It is great value for money and the staff go above and beyond. Free wifi, free 24/7 snacks and drinks, a free taxi to take guests around Nicosia,a great breakfast etc. We were there on Easter Sunday and had a fantastic free BBQ with the other guests. We also enjoyed using the sun terrace to sunbathe! I would definitely stay here and recommend to other guests.",Asty Hotel
40,"Spent one night there on the end of January. Customer Service was wonderful. Free 24/7 snack bar. Free bicycle. Free shuttle service for the city center- the owner actually gave me a ride on 7:30 AM to a place I had to be in. Amazing. The only drawback i can think of is the location, which is a bit far from the city center.",Asty Hotel
40,"My favourite hotel in Lefkosia, a simple 3 star hotel , plain and very standard, but with a 5* smile and this is what brings me back to this hotel. The room (504) was clean however with a smell of smoke (probably by the previous guest) though this is a non smoking hotel. Room was fine, toiletries, but there was no light in the small shower room next to the toilet. So if you take a shower at night, do it in the dark. This was supposed to be taken care by the manager to whom I complained. Free wi-fi, free 24 hour coffee, juices, snacks, free bicycles, a good choice breakfast, and helpful smiling personnel who thank god are locals and not foreigners as is regretfully common in most hotels in Cyprus. Located in an upper class residential area, 2-3 kms from the town centre, and I believe hotel offers free shuttle drive in its own mini bus. There are quite a few excellent food stores (try Zorpas) around as well as tavernas (Pampos) .",Asty Hotel
50,"Staying at one of the executive suites, in this cozy hotel,which is situated at less than 5 mins drive from nicosia centre and a few meters away from a medieval church, we received warm hospitality by the manager and employees.The room and the bathroom were spot clean, a kettle, coffee and tea are available in the room, fresh continental and cypriot breakfast included in the price, cleaners take care of the room twice a day, parking is available. Bicycles are available for a ride.",Asty Hotel
50,"We stayed last night in this small hotel and our experience has been wonderful. First at the reception the lady we met was very very nice and helpful organising also shuttle free of charge for us in the evening to go to another part of the town. Second the room was at least 25 sq mt. large, with a king size bed, very clean and it contained all what we need, much more than a two stars hotel usually have and in many cases even a three stars hotel. The breakfast included in the price was more than enough for us and the quality very good. The price? 47€! In few words: price / value ratio: unbeatable.",Asty Hotel
40,"Great friendly, comfortable, welcoming hotel with free shuttle service and free bike hire. We like it here. Fantastic themed rooms.Only criticism plastic mattress protector in standard rooms. Everything else is good!",Asty Hotel
50,"Very friendly, comfortable hotel - I recommend treating yourselves to the Zebra room which is the best hotel room I ever stayed in. The buffet breakfast was great and there are lots of free snacks/drinks available throughout the day. It is a little out form the centre but there is a free shuttle service.",Asty Hotel
50,"Period of Stay: 26th Dec - 30th Dec 2013 (4 nights)Cost (PER NIGHT): 32 Euros (including taxes - prices obtained via Booking.com) for a single room+ points:(1) 24 hour free snack bar - many have mentioned this and this is the first time I ever heard of any hotel that offers this - a true winner, considering that I read up on many hotels in Cyprus and almost all did NOT even provide breakfast! By the way, Asty provides a decent breakfast as well, which is a choice of different types of eggs, bacon, tomato and potato.(2) Comfortable bed, pillows and the room and toilet were very clean.(3) Wifi was fast and reliable.(4) Good to provide kettle, hair dryer in room and also has a farely decent gym.(5) Staff were generally friendly, in particular Christalla.- point:(1) Location: about 30 minutes by walking (though it is easy to navigate and find from Google Maps) although they provide shuttle service to the city centre.By the way I find Nicosia to be a very useful base and was pleasantly surprised to find excellent day trips to Famagusta and Kyrenia in the Turkish side of Cyprus and the Turkish side of Nicosia was also nice and thus kept me occupied for 3 days. If you wish to do this, I suggest reading more on this website (http://www.northcyprusonline.com/North-Cyprus-Online-Travelling-Bus-Services.php) and asking the tourist info after you cross the border for more information (8 Turkish Liras each way to/from Famagusta and 4.5 Turkish Lira each way to/from Kyrenia from my experience but seems like you can buy a day ticket for 1 Lira less)Also, this is an excellent website where you can get info of how to get around the cities on the Cyprus side - http://www.intercity-buses.com/ (there is an English option on the web page).There were a lot of inaccurate information that I got when I googled for the schedules and costs so use the above website!",Asty Hotel
40,"the price one pays for a room is very reasonable, but bear in mind that the hotel is not near the city centre. I had some difficulty locating the hotel as I was driving. but I figured it out after some headscratching moments with help from nice strangers.There is a free shuttle service, which i made use of to get into the city. Unfortunately, the shuttle wasnt available both times i tried to get a lift back to the hotel, though it was before the stipulated time of 9pm. I guess this is just bad luck. Had to catch a cab back from the city which is about 7 euros.The staff are generally nice, and I had an interesting chat with the owner of the hotel about his philosophy behind the hotel, which is giving what customers want. This is indeed shown in the 24h snack bar, which is perfect for some late night snacking to the cable tv. Wifi is free and efficient.hotel has a gym and a leisure area in the basement. theres a cosy lounge area too. Rooms are nothing to to shout about, but they are more than sufficient and are spacious and comfortable.Overall, for the price, its a perfect choice, but bear in mind the location if that is important to you.",Asty Hotel
50,"The whole experience of staying in this hotel was a complete delight. The staff are the friendliest and most welcoming that we have ever come across. Nothing was a bother for them and they made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived until the moment we drove away. We stayed in a room themed as a Zebra Suite, it was delightful!They have a 24 hour complimentary snack corner, which was an incredible benefit when we arrived back at the hotel cold and wet one night and were able to thaw out with a mug of boiling hot chocolate!We would consider going back to Nicosia just to stay in this lovely, friendly hotel.There was completely free WiFi, cable TV, and a complimentary taxi service.Thanks to all of the staff from sunny Spain!",Asty Hotel
50,"This hotel offers an amazing value for money. The staff is very friendly and you feel at home. There is a free snack corner 24 hours a day. It is not in the city centre, but there is a free shuttle service organised by the hotel. Can you ask for more? Totally recommended.",Asty Hotel
40,"Spent 3 nights for a business trip and chose Asty by mistake thinking that it was close to my job.It is the only mistake that I am glad I have ever made. The hotel although budget oriented offers excellent free wifi, a shuttle bus that will get you everywhere in Nicosia for free in the morning, free snacks 24 hours a day and if you feel like it a bike to move around. The rooms are very modest and seem to be from the early 80's or 90's but they are clean and spacious.Finally the staff really tried to satisfy all customers and provide utmost hospitality.keep in mind, that the hotel is situated about 20-25 minutes walk from the old city and in summer walking there is not really an option.",Asty Hotel
40,"I was in Nicosia for a short period of time, 2 nights, and I choose Asty hotel by some recommendation from friend. This is really good option. Family run hotel, with such as nice and friendly atmposhere which is amazing. Prices are ok. During the 24h in dining room you can use some drinks, fruits etc for refreshments free of charge. You will not make mistake if you come to Asty hotel.",Asty Hotel
40,"The rooms are not worth writing home about, but they do have cable tv. Like the other reviewers said, you can't beat the price. They will shuttle you around for free before 10 pm, there are free snacks, plenty of space to lounge around, bikes are free, circuit weights in the gym (no cardio machines) and the staff is nice. The air conditioning didn't turn on, so I kept the windows open at night. The traffic below was a bit annoying.That said the location is a 10 min drive to the old city. Between there and the hotel is pretty much nothing. You are in the burbs here.",Asty Hotel
50,"It felt like you were living with a relative. The price of a double room was just 40 Euro a day which was extremely cheap. The best part however was the 24 Hours snack room, which was FREE! Yogurt, milk, cereal, juices, tea, coffee, biscuits, spreads, buns, fruits etc it was all available 24/7 and that too in good quantity. If you had a heavy lunch you could easily skip dinner and just have some snacks.A bit far from Ledra (about 20 mins walk) but they provide free shuttle from hotel to Center. Wifi was pretty reasonable as well and was available all over the hotel.I would give it 5/5 for its ""Value for Money"".The only bad this was that there was no ventilation in the washroom so the wooden door to the washroom actually was open from the top. Felt a bit weird.",Asty Hotel
50,"A friend and I stayed at the Asty for 9 days when we were in Nicosia to attend a conference. What a find! The price for room and breakfast could not be beat, and we were so well looked after. Other friends staying at far more expensive (and well known) hotels were quite jealous. There were always complimentary beverages available (hot and cold) as well as fruit, crackers, and cookies, and staff went out of their way to make us comfortable. Dinner recommendations were spot on, and the shuttle was an amazing and rather unexpected perk - it went wherever we needed to go, not just to the old city. Should I return to Nicosia, I will most definitely stay at the Asty. It is a small family-run budget hotel with staff that go out of the way to make sure guests are content. Thanks for a wonderful stay.",Asty Hotel
50,"Warm hospitality, open and caring staff, always willing to help. I arrived around early and was able to check-in upon my arrival (9:00 am) and was offered also coffee and free breakfast. Free bus shuttle to the city center. And on Saturday all guess were invited to free BBQ dinner. On top of the delicious food it was a wonderful way to meet other guests at the hotel and to enjoy a real Cyprian hospitality!!I was alone in foreign country and felt at home thanks to the the staff and management of the hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"Friendly, helpful, attentive staff at this wonderful little family run hotel. Nothing is too much trouble, as much free tea, coffee drinks etc as you wish to have, also fresh fruit available 24 hours a days if you want it together with other little appetizers. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break to Nicosia. Price of 40 euros per night for two with breakfast Could not be better.",Asty Hotel
40,"I had booked a room in Asty hotel, which I cancelled just after my arrival since its location was very far from the place I had to be every day.The reaction of the staff was very friendly, even though they had spent time to prepare the room, and I believe that if we has stayed in the hotel we would have a great time.I recommend it.",Asty Hotel
50,"Very nice and frendly staff, value for money, good service and a lots of facilities. It has very nice rooms, zebra room is great! It also has free bikes! If you looking for a place ti stay for couple of nights without spending a lot of money Asty is the place to stay. Great breakfast. Restaurant is available all day for guests (coffe, tee, soft drinks, snacks). They even have free bus shuttle which can drop you to the city center or anywhere in that range.",Asty Hotel
50,"This little hotel was found via 'booking.com' and we booked 1 hour before arriving. It was a very warm welcome and the room was very clean and had a wonderful Indian feel to it: colours, materials, furniture etc. I'm not sure if there are different themes but we were delighted with ours.There is 24hour free drinks (hot and cold) and free snacks too and breakfast is included. You can use the gym in the basement (actually rather good for a couple of varied workouts) or you can rent a free bike from reception. The wifi is free and the best of any hotel I have ever stayed in.I would recommend this to friends for definite.",Asty Hotel
40,"Value for money is the most important thing for all travellers and this hotel is highly recommended for budget travellers. Polite and open heart owners! Good location, renovated, clean and cheap! If you looking for a place ti stay for one night without spending a lot of money Asty is the place to stay",Asty Hotel
50,"Very clean and comfortable room. Staff extremely friendly. Great breakfast. Restaurant is available all day for guests (coffe, tee, soft drinks, snacks). They even have free bus shuttle which can drop you to the city center. Perfect hotel for good price.Thank you very much ;)",Asty Hotel
50,"We stayed at Asty hotel for 15 nights on three different occasions (business trip) and every time there was just perfect..amazing people, professional and courteous staff, amazing services (free shuttle, free GPS, free all day buffet , free Cycles to ride on, free Wi Fi (Computer Room ), Complimentary Gym, Complimentary barbeque for all guests every week...) we really do recommend this hotel for any kind of your stay...you would love it!Our home in Nicosia-ASTY HOTEL",Asty Hotel
50,"The friend that I was vacationing with chose this hotel and I doubt that I could have chosen better. My room was on the 5th floor and was street-facing. Low noise (but we did go at the end of the summer season), well-functioning A/C (the cleaning staff turns it off if you forget, but it's strong enough to quickly cool the room when you return), comfortable bed, and clean and spacious bathroom. My friend's room was on the 4th floor and I would say the same about that one.The owner and his wife are friendly and helpful. Each morning I was there, they were in the lounge talking with guests and helping as they could. They gave us excellent recommendations and directions on places to go. When my friend made an off-handed comment about hoping her phone had enough charge for the drive into the mountains, Michael went out to his car and brought back his personal charger to lend to us. Although I did not take him up on the offer, Michael also offered to cancel my last night without a fee and book me a room closer to the airport so that I could sleep a bit more before my early flight.I've looked at the few negative reviews people have left here and I can't say that I recognize the Asty in them (although I did not visit the exercise room). The staff (older men and a couple of young women) were pleasant and helpful, and did not seem ""dangerous"" at all. I also never saw anything that made me think the premises were unclean or in a bad neighborhood.If I had to complain about something, I would make two points. 1) One of the times the elevator failed and locked us in, but the man attending the desk didn't hear us ring the alarm a couple of times until we called. 2) If you're planning on not returning to the hotel from outside the city until late at night, be aware that Nicosia's streets make the drive to the hotel a bit twisty; this isn't the fault of the hotel, but if you anticipate getting in late and already being a little tired, it's something to keep in mind.I've already recommended this hotel to a couple of friends.",Asty Hotel
50,"What a pleasant, happy experience at the Asty Hotel. Beautifully clean, neat, friendly, good service, spacious room, generosity, kindness. We could not have wished for a nicer, friendlier stay, thank you to all the staff at Asty hotel, Nicossia, Cyprus",Asty Hotel
50,What a wonderful hotel! The service was brilliant! We had booked two double rooms and when we arrived we were immediately upgraded to the executive suites. When we asked for advice on where to have dinner the gentlemen at the front desk phoned several restaurants to make sure that they were open and gave us a detailed description on how to get there.The breakfast was delicious and again the service was brilliant!We had access to tea and coffee and various snacks all day and night.It was definitely worth more than the money we spent!,Asty Hotel
50,This is a wonderful place to stay for the budget conscious. Excellent service able to cover the lack of location. Highly recommended. He owner goes all out to help travellers new to the city. Free shuttle. Free food and drinks. Bus passes in front of the hotel.,Asty Hotel
50,"I felt positively guilty paying so little for my stay here - even at twice the price it would have been very good value! The room was clean and comfortable, Michael and staff couldn't have been more welcoming, the hotel is in a good location (a 15 minute walk from the walled inner city), the free snacks and drinks were a nice bonus, and the free barbeque (including free bar) on the first evening of my stay was especially welcome and, for a solo traveller, provided a great ""ice breaker"" to encourage socialising with other guests.",Asty Hotel
50,Very nice and clean hotel. Service is perfect!! You have access to drinks and fruits for free 24h:) wi-fi is quite fast. You have air-conditioned room and acces to perfect lobby on the roof. Good breakfast with option for vegetarians.,Asty Hotel
40,"The location is not perfect because it's quite far from the historic center of Nikozia (ca. 30 min by walk, or 10 min by taxi). One or two restaurants in the nearby. The staff were really excellent and very helpful. Free drinks and selection of fruits, desserts etc. for guests. The room was spacious and quiet, the decor and furniture were a little bit outdated, but that was no problem for me. Everything was clean. Great breakfast included in the rate.",Asty Hotel
50,"Only stayed for one night with my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised by the service at Asty. Upon arrival we were immediately upgraded to the Zebra Room which was a fun, patterned and very large room with a balcony. This was at no extra charge.Then when we wanted to go into Nicosia centre we were offered a free shuttle service there and back. The friendly driver would not even accept a tip for his services.The following morning when checking out, they were even more than happy to offer us breakfast even though it was 2 hours after they had stopped serving.On top of free breakfast they also offer free wifi and bike rentals.All this for just 40 euro a night for 2 people. Will definitely be coming here again.Highly recommended.",Asty Hotel
40,"Very nice city hotel, fully justified all good words about it. In the room - free AC, fridge, TV, WIFI.Free shuttle to the centre (we used to get the bus station).For the breakfast offer traditional set of snacks and also cook on your choice fried eggs/ omelette, or something. Also during the day you could visit the breakfast room and choose anything you like to it or drink from the fridge (juices, rice pudding, fruits, jelly). There is no dinner facilities, but guys at the reception suggested several good places not far away.All staff is very friendly, helpful and nice. We will definitely stay there again, if visit Nicosia once more time. Also highly recommended to all other travelers.",Asty Hotel
50,We were very nicely surprised by this hotel and its staff approach to the guests. The room was just beatiful (Indian style) and clean. There was a lot of additional services offered by staff which one would expect at hotels of 4* or 5* category. Definitely the best hotel of all we've been at in Cyprus. I can only recommend it.,Asty Hotel
50,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels and B&B in a lot of different countries in my life and this is one of the best! We've stayed twice and both times the rooms were spotless with good thick curtains which meant I didn't wake up when the sun came up. Good air con kept us cool, good double glazing meant it was quiet. Balcony on both of our rooms. Plenty of hot water. Comfy beds. Fridge to keep the drinks cool and tea/coffee making facilities. Interesting, well done, decor (we had the colourful and Indian rooms; don't stay if you want corporate bland). Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast buffet plus cooked-to-order English breakfast. Free tea, coffee, water, juice, milk, fruit, biscuits etc., (hope people don't abuse this). Nice public rooms. The shuttle to the town is excellent so there is no problem with the location. Free parking and use of bikes! Free wi-fi! We also got a free late check-out (to 6pm) which was offered without us having to ask; we just commented that we had a late night flight. How many other hotels will do that? I can't think of anything negative and I haven't even listed everything great about this place. In addition, Lefkosia is a very interesting place to visit (both sides) with good restaurants, shopping and historic places. If you go to Lefkosia you must stay at Asty. If I go back to Lefkosia I'll stay again at Asty, I loved it!",Asty Hotel
50,"Luxury is nice but not everything!This family owned hotel shows that you can satisfy your customers and get very high ratings making smart choices.- They greeted us with a smile every time we talked to anyone, (except the 2 ladies in the kitchen that looked angry most of the time). The staff was also very service minded, helping us with every question. Calling around to get questions answered! Overall very friendly and helpful!- Both times we stayed here they upgraded us to a suite, because the suite was available. Not a big thing, but who does not like that.- They offer complimentary services that other hotel charges you for. Water, yoghurt, fruit, biscuits, beer (I had 2 and they said it was on the house). They have free wifi, bicycles, shuttle service to the city center (takes about 25 minutes to walk), free car parking and they front with that they will loan you a car gps navigator for free, even if we did not try that. We could not find anything that they would charge you extra for.- Everything was very clean both times we stayed here. No smell, clean sheets, clean towels etc. As it should be!There is a backside to this hotel, and this is the location. But since we only stayed here for two days, and we used the shuttle service going into the city center we did not suffer to much. A taxi charges you between 5-7 Euro for going back to the hotel.With this said, I strongly recommend this hotel, as you already might have guessed.",Asty Hotel
50,"We stayed for a couple of nights in transit. When we arrived, we were met with a smile. We were shown where to obtain free refreshments and snacks. Our room was comfortable, if a bit eccentric, and spotlessly clean. All the freebies ! Shuttle into town - a fascinating place, nothing like I expected. Quiet, so good for sleeping. To be recommended, and preferable by far to a bland 'luxury' hotel. Thank you to all there, for your kindness and hospitality.",Asty Hotel
50,"I have been several days in Asty Hotel, in Lefkosia (Nicosia), at the beginning of May 2013 and I found myself very well, coming back to Asty even after a short trip to Aya Napa and Lemessos.. The staff is really friendly and meets all customers requirements. They offer complimentary drinks and fruits and you will find free wi-fi in every room. As you can see watching Nicosia map, the location is a bit far from the center, in the area of Embassies, but the front desk is available to give you a lift with the hotel minibus. They are also available free hotel bicycles. If you want to walk to the central street of the old town, Ledras street, it needs about 30 minutes. If you want to save about 7 euro taxi, take the Bus 259 in front of the flower shop Tacora (1 euro) to Solomon square. On the way back, from the same place, I recommend Bus 127 (it drops in front of the private Policlinic). The rooms are clean, with balconies, good beds and new LCD TV. And there's also a room decorated in black and white (zebra style), a colorful one and an Indian-style one! I mean, I really enjoyed it, i'd like to thank the friendly and helpful owner Mr. Michael, Christalla the smiling girl at the desk, the Moldava woman in the breakfast room and all the staff. If i will return to Lefkosia certainly i will come back to the warm and comfortable Asty Hotel. Greetings from Alfredo! Bye!",Asty Hotel
50,"The service at this place is stellar. The owner greeted us when we arrived and was superbly friendly and helpful. There are free snacks (fruit, yoghurt, rice pudding, cookies, toast, juice, milk) available 24/7, free rental bikes, a free shuttle service to town (although we opted for the bikes) and also a gym and free wifi. We got an upgrade to a themed room (zebras - all black and white), which was very modern and spacious.The hotel is not in the center but with the free bikes you can get downtown in no time.We had a bit of trouble finding the hotel but that was mainly me not printing out a better map of the area.",Asty Hotel
40,"Stayed just the one night here earlier in April.Clean hotel, has free wifi, a little crazy golf course on the roof, 4 computers for free use and a gym and games room.Friendly welcoming staff. The breakfast room is open 24/7 for coffee/tea etc, yoghurt, some biscuits, creals and cakes.I was in a triple room to myself which was clean and has a good size fridge.I understand they have bikes to use but afraid I didn't stay long enough to use one!Overall a great hotel for the price.",Asty Hotel
50,"Staying at the Asty Hotel has been one of my most pleasant traveling experiences in a long while. The hotel staff really go the extra mile to make you feel welcomed and treat you just family. Here are some examples of their generosity towards me that made my visit so pleasant:- Guest Treatment: I arrived to Nicosia on the early flight from Beirut and, even though I showed up at the hotel's doors at 1000, they checked me in with no problem. Not only did they check me in way early, they allowed me to pick whichever room was available which was quite decent of them. The room I selected was outfitted with an Indian motif and it was spacious, bright, and airy...in other words, very nice. It also had a nice balcony which gave me a great view of Nicosia.- Benefits: The hotel offers a tremendous amount of free benefits/services which you would have to pay for in other places. For example, I used their new Garmin GPS' to traverse my way throughout the southern portion of the island. I couldn't have done what I did, and visited the places I did, without the assistance of the GPS. The hotel also offers free use of their bicycles for guests (nice bikes by the way) and provides free transport to places around Nicosia. I didn't use the bicycles but I did use their transport system to get to the Old Town and found it quite convenient.- BBQ/Free Snacks: The hotel conducted a free BBQ for all its guests during the Sunday night I was there. The food was excellent and plentiful. The hotel also offers free drinks (beer and soft drinks) and snacks for all hotel guests at any time. I also enjoyed the breakfast offerings which the hotel puts out on a daily basis. It was a great start to my day and tided me over well into the late afternoons while I was visiting different sites around the island.- Location: Location is also very good, just a 15 minute leisurely walks from the Old Town, in case you don't want to use the hotel's shuttle service.All in all, I couldn't speak more highly of the Asty Hotel. My stay was extremely pleasant and I highly recommend it as a tourism base while in Cyprus.",Asty Hotel
30,"the best of the hotel is that you get a minibus ride anytime to center.My room was not bad, but the bathroom was probably weird and it was no good at all.Hotelet is clean and has a satisfying breakfast.",Asty Hotel
40,"I stayed here for 4 days with my Taekwondo team and I am not ready to forget them. I had a double room with four single beds. the rooms and bathrooms were clean, sheets were clean too. the rooms were just the right size, with the right amount of storage space. The hotel is very generous offering two fridges in the lobby full with juices, yoghurt, water and fruits for the guests free of charge 24/7. they have a free shuttle to downtown Nicosia which is about 2 km away. free Wifi. what I enjoyed the most is the free bicycles service they have, they came in really handy, we used them to go have a drink in Downtown at night instead of taking cabs.I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Nicosia for a few days or even a long stay as the neighbourhood is very peaceful.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed in asty hotel for 9 nights (business trip) and everything there was just perfect..amazing people, amazing services (free shuttle, free gps, complimentary barbaque for all guests every week, all day bufet...) I really do recommend this hotel for any kind of your stay...you will like it!",Asty Hotel
40,"We had the good fortune to come across this family run hotel recently and had a comfortable over night stay.The room was bright, spacious and clean with a small balcony overlooking the busy backstreets of the city. The bed was large and the sheets crisp! ( my husband has had a double hip operation but found the bed comfortable! Which is unusual.) The shower was fun, in that one could sit down in it, which was very useful when cleaning dusty tired feet. It was clean and incredibly powerful and very warm. Lovely!The Staff and management couldn't have been more helpful; they ferried us to and from recommended tourist spots free of charge.There is a continental breakfast available included in the price of the room. Although there were tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom, Water, tea, coffee, fruit juice and a mini bar was on offer at all times in the dining room as well as fresh fruit and Greek yoghurt.There is no facility for an evening meal at the hotel, so eating out is essential. I would commend booking somewhere through the staff at the hotel, since the popular restaurants were full. However, we walked up to the commercial district at the end of the road and ate a very good meze at a modern restaurant.The price of the stay was very good value for money indeed. The decor is a prime example of 1960s style and colour. Go with it and enjoy this little gem for what it is- unpretentious and homely.",Asty Hotel
50,"Stayed for two nights in March 2013 and I totally agree with the positive reviews I've read.Actually it's more than a 3+ stars hotel, despite the official 2 star status.It's in a very quiet neighborhood, (most of the embassies are around), the room has a lot of space and there's a hot water boiler, tea, sugar, instant coffee and decaf in the room, in order to make your own drink.Free wifi Internet everywhere at nice speeds.The room is clean and most of the room is refurbished.Large flat TV in the room has many channels from all over Europe & Asia.Breakfast is ok for the category, different types of coffee from a coffee maker machine and they give you a choice of 4 different types of eggs made on demand! (I chose scrambled eggs).They offered to move me -for free- in the hotel's minibus to the city center and in my final day to the shuttle bus station, in order to get to Larnaca airport.Excellent value for its low price, I would highly recommend it!",Asty Hotel
50,"Hotel is based in charming residential area, about 20 min on foot from the Ledra street. As long as you are not looking for sunny beaches, Nicosia is the greatest spot on the island. And Asty Hotel is a good addition. Interior of the hotel is not very fancy, but still quite pleasant. Spacious lounge, dining room and library room on the ground floor. Tourist materials like maps and folders are available. Also good selection of daily papers.RoomsFirst impression might be that they are worn down, however everything works perfectly fine and remains in good condition. My spacious room had TV, fridge, AC, phone, small desk. Apart from that, it was very clean. Room is more than satisfactory, as long as you are not used to top class chain hotels.FoodBreakfast is served from 6.30 till 10.30. I would say it is “continental extra” breakfast. Fair selection of bread, ham, cheese, yoghurt, vegetables. Overwhelming selection of fruits, sweets (also home-made), muesli and eggs. Huge range of juices and coffee available. Quality of everything is proper. Apart from that, the breakfast room stays open 24/7 with all the drinks and some snacks available. This is very convenient and not typical even for family run hotels.Other facilities and highlightsFree shuttle – within 2 nights I have spent at the hotel, I have used it 4 times, including picking me up from the place where Larnaca Airport bus terminates, which is not very close to the hotel. I have never been denied this service and a car has been always available on stand-by. Brilliant.Early check in – I got a room as early as at 10 am. Truly nice.Roof terrace, bike rental (I didn’t use), gym (I didn’t use).The only Asty’s drawbacks are a bit ageing facilities, but this hotel is still an awesome place of great atmosphere with very helpful, polite and friendly staff. Within this price category I have never seen any better option, not only in Cyprus, but also round the Europe. I give the highest notes.Regards,Michal",Asty Hotel
40,"This is one hotel that is great value for money. I stayed there for twelve nights in December to beginning of January. Staff very friendly and helpful. Clean and spacious rooms ( was in room 210). Excellent free Internet service, walkable distance to city centre. They even offer free taxi service to city centre if you don't want to walk. Quiet and safe neighborhood. The gym though needs to be revamped as the machines are obsolete. Otherwise had a great time staying there.",Asty Hotel
50,"All the great reviews about this hotel are true. It is a cosy place, the staff is very helpful, polite and friendly. The rooms are clean and despite the fact that they look rather old they are in good condition. Breakfast is very good, you get to order your eggs the way you want them to be served and everything is very tasty. Moreover -and that is very rare to find- the breakfast room remains open all day and night and you can eat anything that is there (biscuits, water, juices and sweets in the fridge, tea and coffee) FREE of charge! So you can have a free snack anytime you want!The hotel is located about 2 kilometers away (roughly a 20 min walk which is not difficult to do as the city is flat) from the city center (Solomou Square) and that is perhaps the only disadvantage of the hotel, however this can also be fixed. The hotel has its own cars which can take you anywhere in the city (of course you have to make arrangements with the reception) and that is also free of charge! So no need for taxi! When we left for Limassol, a very friendly and helpful driver from Sri Lanka came and picked us up from from the hotel and drove us to Solomou Square. You can also use bus 259 which stops very close to the hotel but it is not very frequent. There are some bicycles in front of the hotel which you can use (I am not sure whether they charge for those as I didn't ask), this is also an excellent way to get around Nicosia if you have the time.I would definetely recommend Asty Hotel for a pleasant stay.P.S. If you want to visit the northern part of the city make sure you take your passport with you when you go for a walk up Ledra street.",Asty Hotel
20,"We were in shock to find that this low priced hotel is also of low quality - - I would go so far as to say it is a dump with a foul smell in the halls. All I wanted was a quiet sleep and not to be worried about noise and safety concerns by hourly patrons making good use of the hourly rate. When I think of all the places I have stayed on Sales and Study trips - the ASTY will live forever in my mind as the one where I was fooled by head scratching reviews. At first it seemed like a run down but quiet inn - our room was a bit in disrepair but you get what you pay for. Then as night fell - noisy ""couples"" started to check in and out. Our shower didn't even work properly (kept going from cold to colder). The only thing good about the place was that there was cabs waiting to take me out of town and away from this place. Too bad they had to toot the horn all evening and keep us awake.",Asty Hotel
50,"If you are searching for a hotel in Nicosia. Stop searching, and book the Asty Hotel. You will not regret it.Check in was a breeze by Mr. Costa at reception. Handed me my key and showed me the snack bar, as well as handing me an invite to a barbeque been hosted by the hotel.The room was big and comfortable, so too the bathroom. I have stayed in many hotels around the world, more expensive and better grading, but none compare to the Asty's rooms.The barbeque was amazing. The souvla was delicious and the eating area had a wonderful aroma of the meat on the spit. There was an excellent spread of salads, rice, potatoes and pilafi (try that with yogurt!). The hotel owner, Mr. Michael was a most gracious host, mingling with the guests and ensuring everybody was comfortable and had a drink in their hand. A very socialable and friendly person. It felt like I was amongst family, not a hotel.The next morning I needed to drive into Nicosia to deal with some famliy business. The receptionist showed me where to go on the map, and asked how I was getting there. I said by car, and she handed me a GPS/Sat Nav device, after entereing the address where I needed to be. The car rental company wanted to charge me 10 Euros per day. The hotel charged me nothing. Such a kind and wonderful touch. I used the GPS for the duration of my stay in Nicosia, and it saved me many times from getting lost.The dining room has a coffee machine and a well stocked fridge, so you can help youreslf to coffee/tea at any time. The fridge contains snacks which you can also help youself to. And again no charge. I recommend you try the rice pudding, and I challenge you to have only one.Wifi was available throughout the hotel, and again no charge and no limits placed on usage.Whenever I walked into or around the hotel, I was greeted by name, and the staff would stop and have a quick chat, asking how I was and how I had spent my day. I really felt I was amongst family and friends and was treated as such.Across the road is a bakery, if you want to try some Greek/Cypriot delights. There is also another bakery about 100 meters up the road, as well as a small supermarket for any odds and sods that you might require.I am hoping to visit Cyprus again, sometime soon, and I will definately be staying at the Asty again.Book this hotel, you won't regret it.",Asty Hotel
50,"I have stayed at the Asty a few times and it continues to be excellent . It is a Cypriot family owned hotel and opened in the 1960s as the Hilarion Hotel with one story and 10 rooms. It has been regularly upgraded since then and is now a modern and very comfortable hotel. In the old tradition ,it has a lovely lounge and library for relaxing and reading , a dinning room with excellent breakfast buffet and a bar with comfortable seating. Also a gym in basement .There is free wifi in rooms that works well , satellite TV with foreign stations in English,German and Russian . There is Al Jazerra news in English and movie channels. Breakfast is excellent and included in room rate . Cereals,toast,cakes, jams, dried fruit ,yogurt, cold meats, salad and cheeses, fruit juice ,tea/coffee ,fresh fruit , & eggs,bacon,potatoes and tomatoes (freshly cooked) The Cypriot staff are all very friendly and helpful , many have worked at the hotel for many years. There are 2 excellent upmarket rooms called the Colour Room and the Zebra room , both decorated according to the name . I have been upgraded to the Zebra room which is really nice, large and comfortable.There is a free shuttle bus into the centre of Nicosia . They can also collect you from airports in Paphos or Larnaca for a charge. Yesterday ,I booked through www.booking.com and paid only Euros45- , good value . Now and again,the hotel has a free Cyprus BBQ in the evening , BBQ chicken and pork with salad ,dips and bread, desserts and beer or wine or whisky. It is all free of charge for guests staying at the hotel ( including alcohol) and a great idea to generate repeat business. I was lucky to arrive on the free dinner evening and it was really a good meal, with 3 small beers. They also have free tea/coffee and juice with biscuits and cake all day and can arrange lunch or dinner on request (no menu ) .The hotel has a certificate of excellence from Trip Advisor for 2011 and 2012 , both hanging in the reception area. It is not the Hilton level but I can highly recommend this hotel in Nicosia. I will always use it .",Asty Hotel
40,"The staff and services at the Asty were wonderful. I was treated as a valued guest. My room was clean and comfortable and the common areas were all clean and comfortable too. The breakfast was delicious and the snack/dining area was always open and well stocked for a late night or earlyu morning coffee, tea, or snack. I was taken to my destination each morning for no extra charge. The hotel has aging areas, but the ower's committment to not obligating the hotel to loans for upgrading areas such a the hall and stair ways, is an honorable committment to financial stablity. The remainer of the hotel was clean and comfortable. I will stay at the hotel Asty for all my future stays in Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
50,"The Good:Great and Friendly Staff. Complementary Snacks and refreshments. Good Amenities in the Room. Free Bicycles Location just outside of the city center. Half Covered Car Parking just behind the hotel. Great Value for Money.The Not So Good:The hotel is not well indicated on google maps. However, the hotel staff was very helpful and sent somebody to drive us back to the hotel. Hotel is not in a walking distance from the Touristic City Center, however, if you have a car, or wouldn't mind using the provided bikes, it is very close. They even propose to drive you sometimes.",Asty Hotel
40,"It's the perfect hotel for normal people. Every ""extra"" in the hotel seems to be free: bikes, minibus, GPS, minigolf, breakfast buffet available 24hs! You only pay 11 euros for lunch or dinner. There is not menu but the food that they prepared for us was amazing, like if a local mom were the chef.Rooms has a lovely balcony and a lot of space. Ours was the colour room that my girlfriend loved it. There are not enough sockets but they are probably working on it as there are LED lamps without sockets in the desks (2).The location is good for business or to go to conferences to the university, there is not shops around and only one restaurant (quite good). They bring you whatever you want for free so usually it's not a problem.Staff is very friendly, some more than others, but in general over average.It the perfect hotel for normal people that want to feel at home while they are abroad. I don't have room service or a menu at home so I don't expect a hotel to have.",Asty Hotel
30,"but it was a bit too rustic for me, 45 Euros might be pushing it.ladies at the reception are incredibly nice and service is greatI will pay more on my next visit and stay at a more comfortable hotel nearer to the old city",Asty Hotel
50,"Have just returned home following our 3rd visit this year to the Asty Hotel.We come to Nicosia for medical treatment, and I have to say that staying at the Asty makes what might otherwise be an anxious time into a very pleasant experience. I requested a quiet room as I would need to rest following treatment, this was sorted for me prior to arrival with no problem - we were allocated a room on the 4th floor at the back of the hotel, so was not disturbed by traffic noise during the day.The hotel is very clean & tidy throughout, and there is clearly an ongoing programme of improvements -  each time we visit something is new or has been updated.The rooms are spacious, and our bed was very comfortable with new 'memory foam' type mattress.  The bathroom fixtures are relatively new as well, with a good quality shower.  The room has a large flat screen TV - I brought a portable DVD player with me & some DVDs to watch whilst I was resting in the room.  There is also a full-size fridge, aircon, safe, hairdryer, ironing board, tea & coffee making facilities, & free wifi throughout the hotel.As other people have mentioned, you can help yourself to drinks & snacks in the dining room at any time, there are free bikes, gym, games room, mini golf on the roof, free-to-use computers, a spacious lounge. The free shuttle service took us into the town centre & also to our clinic when needed.All the staff are really friendly, helpful, and efficient.  Anything you ask seems to be no problem at all.What is offered here goes above & beyond what you might expect given the very reasonable rates.  Thank you to all at the Asty, you should be very proud of yourselves.Jenny & Paul",Asty Hotel
40,"If you want to enjoy the city of Nicosia, this is the place to be.The Hotel is basic but the rooms are wide and clean with everything you need.The staff is friendly and helpful. The Paphos Door (City center) is 3km and if you dont want to take a walk (the road is still very simple) the hotel offers a free shuttle service.Breakfast is included in the price and available 24 hours a day including the dining room that offers more water, juices, pastries, coffee and fruit.For each question, the staff will help you find an answer.Free Wi-Fi on each floor... what else?All this for 45 Euros a night ... Enjoy your stay",Asty Hotel
50,"My husband and I were blown away by our experience at the Asty Hotel - we could never have expected such a wonderful stay. The staff were exceptional - providing us with maps, helping us order dinner when we arrived late at night, even bringing a glass of wine to our room! Our room was very large and comfortable. The breakfast was outstanding. Although I was a bit concerned about not being right in the city center, there was no need to worry - we were dropped off and picked up and it wasn't even very far away. Michael, the owner, treated us like family and could not have made us feel more at home, recommending the best things to see in Nicosia, telling us to help ourselves to the snacks and drinks at the hotel which were available at all times, taking us into the city and even telling us what we should see and do on our next stop in the Troodos Mountains. I would stay at the Asty again in a heartbeat, and you should look no further for a place to stay in Nicosia!",Asty Hotel
50,"A group of us attending a conference stayed at Hotel Asty in September and I have been inspired to write my first ever trip advisor review because I simply have to say how wonderful it was. All the staff are delightful and so very very generous - free transport everywhere in the mini bus, a coffee lounge open 24 hours with free refreshments and a free and delicious bbq were just some of the many examples of the best hospitality I have ever experienced. We were treated like family and it became a home away from home. We had such a wonderful stay - thank you and hope to return for another visit in the future. Thank you once again Hotel Asty !",Asty Hotel
50,"I really enjoyed staying at the Asty hotel. They gave me a room number 505, which is signed as ""color executive"" in the door. The room was decorated with several colors and it looked modern and cosy. I felt very comfortable. They open a snack bar for 24 hours so you can have drinks and snacks at any time. The breakfast, especially fried eggs, was delicious. One downside is that it is far from the city center. They offer a free shuttle service to the city center, but I got lost when I go back to the hotel by foot, taking almost one hour. It would take minimum 30 minutes to walk to/from the Lidra street.",Asty Hotel
40,"We stayed at Asty towards the end of June 2012. The people there were very friendly and accommodating. Because it’s some 20 minutes walk to the old town centre, they offered bicycles for free. We stayed for a couple of nights, then decided to spend a few days in the Turkish side in Dipkarpaz. The owner said that it was OK to leave the car in the hotel’s parking for the time we were on the ‘other side’, which was a huge help, as we didn’t have to pay for public parking.Rooms at the top floor were clean and seemed new or at least recently redecorated. Breakfast was OK. When we arrived they offered us fruit, yoghurt and juice.All in all it was a positive experience. Left the best impression of all hotels we stayed in in Cyprus.",Asty Hotel
50,"We visited Nicosia to attend a friend's wedding. We were in Nicosia with some other friends too who stayed at the Hilton Park (which is where the wedding was) but we opted for the Asty instead as it was much better reviewed on tripadvisor (and half the price!) and we don't regret it one bit!We checked in straight away (arrived at about 9pm) and settled into our room. Our request for a double bed and a cot for our 3 month old son was followed through and we found a nice big room with air condition, water and tea and coffee facilities. Free wifi was also available. We were also informed that water, tea, coffee, juices, fruit, cereal and some biscuits were available for free at any time from the dining room.The next morning we made use of the free shuttle van service they offer to take us into the city centre and when we were done we just called them and they came to collect us immediately. This was very convenient for us - particularly since we were travelling with our son and had to pack in the pushchair everytime.The hotel also offers a free gym, mini golf, library, computers, bicycles and gps!! We didn't have time to try any of these however.Overall we had a great experience and also enjoyed our small chats with the owner when he dropped us off/picked us up wherever we needed to go.Would definitely recommend it to anyone needing to stay in Nicosia.(It is only a 5 minute drive from the city centre)",Asty Hotel
50,Mind the hotel is not in the Center but you only will be bothered for 5 seconds. The staff of this hotel is the living example of proper hospitality- they blow you away. Second: somehow you will feel it is your home - there are many things like library...big lounge downstairs... big dining room always open for you with filled fridge and the constant opportunity for you to snack something. There is a little cyprian place nearby to eat (great food and local atmosphere- the staff will tell you where it is) and a big bakery on the other side.,Asty Hotel
50,"The Asty Hotel is the epitome of a friendly, family run hotel that goes that extra mile for their guests. It is clean, well equipped and Has everything you could need to make your stay perfect. Staff are, and feel like, family. I really can't fault it or recommend it highly enough. Staying there and meeting them made my trip.",Asty Hotel
50,"This is a very pleasant familiy hotel in a residential area west of the old town. There isn't much to say about the hotel itself: the rooms feel a bit old, but they are clean and refurbished. It's not 5 stars but there are some nice to have commodities like a large gym with table tennis, and a mini golf on the roof. Breakfast buffet is forgettable, but they offer nice and fresh english breakfast. Cold beverages, fruits and puddings in the fridge are always available if you need a snack anytime (even after checkout!).The main quality of this hotel is its genuine service. Staff is very friendly and will do their best to help you, give some advice and make yourself feel like home.  Location is not the best as you'll need to walk a good 20min on a rather boring road to reach the old town. But it's no big deal since they have complimentary bikes and very efficient shuttle service to wherever you need to go. Even if you have a car you can just leave it at the parking and enjoy being driven to the museum, old Nicosia etc. If I come back to Nicosia, I'll stay at Asty again, even if I usually like luxury hotels!",Asty Hotel
40,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Asty Hotel. Our host Michael was a generous and warm man who made us very welcome. We were driven into the city and could have been picked up any time but chose to walk back. His kitchen was open for snacks and drinks 24 hours which was fantastic. Breakfast was freshly cooked for each patron and a wonderful meal to begin the day. Our room was spacious and comfortable with everything we needed and quiet, which was great when we were not far out of the city centre. I couldn't recommend The Asty highly enough, especially for such a reasonable price, and I would give it 4 stars.Carol and Michael Morgan, Australia.",Asty Hotel
50,"If you have got nobody in Nicosia, don't worry! The manager and staff of this hotel will become your family members during your stay. They will even support you after you have checked out in order to travel to other cities in Cyprus. People at Asty are very kind, friendly and helpful. They offer you lots of free useful services there.",Asty Hotel
50,"We stayed at the Asty for three night during a trip round Cyprus in October (on which we stayed in 5 different hotels), and this hotel was easily the best.We were greeted with enthusiasm and obvious pride by the proprietors on arrival. They offered us a (free) drink, showed us the dining room, and encouraged to help ourselves, at any time, to drinks, fruit, rice puddings, and other goodies from the fridge. Then they told us we could help ourselves to drinks - whenever we liked - from the small but well stocked and unmanned bar!! Our eyes just about fell out of our heads, as offering this to two Scots is asking for bankruptcy. I presume it's just an off-season thing, but this would be worth clarifying.The freebies just kept coming. Free Wifi (albeit slow) in all rooms. Free use of bikes to explore the city. Need to go somewhere? We'll drive you there in the hotel taxi, free. Minigolf on the roof of the third floor, free. Free computer room, gym equipment, on and on and on.We were given a map, had the main sites plotted, and an itinerary suggested, some of which we accepted and some of which we ignored.We were given ""the colour room"". It was large, vibrantly decorated (see photos), and spotlessly clean, with en suite, powerful shower, minibar, safe, balcony, air-con & ceiling fan, and a flat-screen TV with a few English channels.A bus from the main bus station in Nicosia will take you to the hotel (no. 172 if memory serves), but ask the driver to tell you when to get out. However, if the hotel taxi is free, they will come and pick you up free of charge. Note that this isn't always the case - sometimes they'll be on other jobs and it may take a while for them to get around to you. If your in a rush, ask them to phone a cab.Breakfast is a Cypriot buffet (various cheeses, cold meat, toast, fruit, olives, and cooked eggs) which was never in danger of running out. Can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat there.The only, very minor quibbles I could think of: 1) The hotel is a bit out of the way. However, between busses and the hotel taxi it's not hard to get to the centre - either will take about 10 minutes 2) The Wifi is slow - don't bother trying to download a movie 3) no hair-drier or iron, though there was an ironing board. I have no doubt that they would have provided these had we asked, and anyway, who needs to iron on holiday?!As an extra tip - the shop across the road is an outstanding delicatessen, well worth a look. The only nearby restaurant, however (turn right out the hotel and walk 5 minutes) - is a disappointment and should be avoided.In summary, the hotel had all you'd expect from a budget hotel in the UK, but I have never experienced so many add-ons and such enthusiasm from a hotel in the UK (or anywhere else). If I'm ever in Nicosia again, I'll be back here.",Asty Hotel
50,"The staff are great! Always friendly, always smiling. Free coffee/tea and small snacks all day long! Free bicycle loan and free minibus into the city. Book with confidence - this hotel is clean and comfortable, has crazy golf on the roof, games and gym in the basement.",Asty Hotel
50,"If you like to feel at home when you are travelling and want to have a real old time hotel then this is the place for you. The rooms are fine, with television and air conditioning and with shower and toilet facilities.But the speciallty of this hotel is the open house feeling. the dining room is open all the time. Two big refrigerators with fruit, juices, water and light dairy are for the use of the travellers. There is a small sport room with ping pong and a walking machine for those who have time.There is a comfortable lounge and the porch is open for those who want to sit outside.The usual clients are business people and there is a free shuttle from the hotel to the other parts of the city.If you come to Nicosia for business or pleasure this is the place for you.Aliya Kedem, Rehovot Israel2/10/2012",Asty Hotel

During our stay there we were very impressed with the hospitality of the proprietor,,the cleanliness of the hotel and all the facilities on offer. The staff were very friendly and helpful.The breakfast was very good with a large variety and choice of hot and cold food. There was access to free hot and cold drinks fruit, desserts, yogurts etc 24hours a day.We hired a car but there was a free shuttle available to take you into town.It was excellent value for money and we would recommend the hotel with confidence.

It's unforgettable! I want to thank personally to Michel, Margharita & Kumara for their warm and sincere promotion.",Asty Hotel
40,"Very welcoming personable staff (family-run). Comfortable clean room. Location to west of old town but they provide free transport into old town. Free hot and cold drinks and snacks at any time.

They give insightful tips on the places to visit and the most convenient way to do it. Cold water, fruits, yoghurts, tea, coffee are available free of charge at all times. My stay if I ever return to Nicosia. A++++++++",Asty Hotel
50,"It is located in a residential area- safe and clean. There is a huge bakery and a very nice small local restaurant nearby- worth to try!. It is a bit far from the centre but you won't feel any hiccups to get into the city after the generous breakfast- the company's car or the owner himself is happy - I mean happy- to give you a lift. You feel you are at home - you make a coffee or a tea whenever, you open the fridge in the dining room where juices, yoghurts fresh fruits and some sweets are waiting x you. You can have it in their big lounge area or on the balcony just in front. The staff is wonderfully nice and caring. There is an open area on the 4th floor with spectacular views of the city- it gives space to play mini golf but I also have seen some sun beds around. You will get a wow about cyprian hospitality and people",Asty Hotel
50,"I came to Nicosia as a student and I arrived late so I stayed for 4 days in the hotel and it was really a nice place, the food was great and you feel like home. The service is excellent and the staff are very kind.

I personally advise everyone to try this hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"Stayed for 3 days . Arrived late a night but was able to get a welcome tea , coffee or cold drinks also available 24/7 a fridge stocked with a range of fruit , cakes yogurts . Very welcome . The hotel is traditional , what it lacks in minimalist decor it makes up for in service. Michael strives to provide an excellent service , he & his staff succeed . The sat nav provided by the Asty was very useful . Our rooms were serviced daily and a wide selection of dishes to choose from at breakfast . A comfortable stay with excellent service, certainly would recommend the Asty and will be staying again.",Asty Hotel
40,"We visited Nicosia recently and we stayed for two nights at the Asty hotel. It is a simple, nice and very clean hotel. The service is friendly and very helpful. The room was spacious and sunny. Nice location. Great value for money.",Asty Hotel
50,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Asty hotel. I recently moved to Cyprus and the hotel staff were beyond friendly. They helped me with anything they could . The hotel is simple, large, and in my opinion all you need when staying in another country. They provide great wifi, simple breakfast, and shuttle buses to wherever you need to go in the city of Nicosia. Although the hotel is not net, it is extremely clean. What struck me the most was the friendliness of the hotel staff. Every ten days they have a barbeque for all the guests, it was great. I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed here for a conference in September and found it to be one of the best hotel experiences I've had in years. Rooms were spotlessly clean, staff were friendly and helpful and the owner Michael made us feel like part of his family. He even put on a bbq for us with free food and drinks! You really couldn't ask for more with this hotel! Other delegates who were staying at the Hilton Hotel who visited Asty even told us they wished they'd stayed at the Asty too! I don't know how anyone who has genuinely stayed at this hotel could give it a bad review, I really can't recommend it enough.",Asty Hotel
10,"the Asty is a bad bad bad hotel. without a doubt the worst ever. My night stay there was an ordeal in keeping my sanity as one thing went wrong after another. we called our travel agent on the phone and they were not surprised at what we told them. The area of town is very shady; esp at night. Guests or ""customers"" are going in and out of the rooms at all hours of the night ; there must be an hourly rate for the rooms. The A/C didn't work at all and the place smelled so bad it made me sick to my stomach. Yes the price is cheap - but you are getting what you pay for and the dump rates only 1 1/2 stars. Oh what a wonderful feeling it was to get into that air conditioned cab and pull away from the curb of this nightmare.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed in this hotel first by myself and then as part of a big group of European friends and conference delegates and we had a very good experience. The staff are very friendly and the space is comfortable and close enough to both Nicosia old town and the University if you are good on foot. Otherwise you are able to hire bicycles for free and often the owner/co-owner [Michael] went out of his way to give us a lift to the university or to a restaurant. The breakfast is delicious and you are always able to have free bottled water, juices, fruits as well as coffees throughout the day.The atmosphere is truely wonderful as you feel as part of a family [a nice and functioning one] and the host also, on occassion, offered free lovely food in the evenings. Overall I would definitely come again and advise my friends to stay here if they visit the very special space that is Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
20,"we will not be coming back to this Asty - - - - all i can say is that i am very surprised by the good reviews - - - the quarters, service, reception and food are all below average. I was fooled once but will not be fooled again. - - - at best (when the streets are not filled with noise) this dump can only be rated as average in my book. all i require is a good night sleep - and this was impossible here.",Asty Hotel
50,"As a regular traveller worldwide i can safely say i have never been better treated at a hotel than at the Asty. Family run place where the guests are at the centre. All sorts of free services - wifi, water, fruit, shuttles. Clean and comfortable rooms and a 4th floor terrace with mini-golf. A marvellous experience shared with friends from all over Europe. Especially ideal if you are a big group attending a conference at nearby Univeristy of Nicosia as we were.",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed there one night and although the hotel is classified as a two star hotel, the service I received was by far the same as five star hotels. Micheal who is the co-owner of the hotel is incredibly kind and the girls at the reception were very friendly.Breakfast was very nice with fresh omelets made to your own tastes. Free refreshments available through out the day. On top everything else, free service to the city center and back to the hotel. What more can they possibly do!Just go and stay at this place if you want to have a fabulous time.",Asty Hotel
50,"It´s really difficult for me to compit with all of the others´ guests reviews, talking about the great people running this lovely hotel in Nicosia. As I aways say what makes a hotel excellent is the people, not the stars, and this is definitely the case.",Asty Hotel
20,"we have been one night for business trip, and we took the recommendation of the hotel from theTripadviseor as always.Unfortunately and although Hotel Asty was recommended as number 1# in Nicosia (as the last week of July 2012), we found a very old and basic hotel. the rooms have a weird smell, room are furnished with old carpet and the mattress was very uncomfortable.the mini-bar was empty and our request to fill it up was denied because they do not fill it up ever.the gim room is equipped with old devises and the air condition did not work at all.breakfast was less than basic and the food was less than any standard we have seen.The description on the web-sight does not match the reality, for example there is no room service.I wonder why is the deference between the visitors. maybe not all the rooms are in the same condition..the good part is that the staff was very polite and you can use the hotel bicycles for fee.",Asty Hotel
50,"Everything in this hotel was perfect. Great service (amazing people), nice buffet breakfast, free coffee all day long and nice, clean rooms. They also have a free van to the city (we didn;t use it cause we had our transportation) Absolutely recommended!",Asty Hotel
40,"Asty Hotel is a really nice and comfy property in Nicosia. Only the location is not perfect - the hotel is situated quite far from the old city, about 20 min away. The sfatt at fornt deske were extremly firndly and helpfull. The room was spacious and celan, however not very modern. There was free WiFi in the room. The breakfast was very good and the hotel offers some drinkls and food for free during the whole day and evenings. Very good option for stay in Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
50,"I was there for a day, had to pick a place for the day cause I had a flight back on the same dayI made a mistake and booked a room for two instead of one.The owner , Michael insisted I will be paid back the deference. Then I had to leave to the airport before dinner in the hotel, so they prepared dinner especially for me.I have been traveling all my life and I must admit, I never meet such wounderful, warm and honest people in any hotel I ever stayed in.The rooms are basic nothing fancy but big clean and quite.They have free coffee and tea, fruits and other foods in the ground floor all day.I missed the amazing barbecue they had for dinnner, the whole hotel was on charcoal flames.Its a very good choice and I will come there again, when I am in Cyprus",Asty Hotel
50,"This is luxury in diguise. Don't be fooled by Asty's Average Joe exterior and slightly worn reception, this is a traveller's gem.The staff speak good English and are very service-minded, ready to address the customers' needs. What impressed us most, however, was the free drinks (a variety of juices, milk & hot beverages) and snacks avaliable in the dining room at all.times. We exploited this to the point of embarrassment, but never received any attitude. The breakfast was also extensive and of good quality. Further, the hotel has a computer room with internet access, free of charge. The facilities also include mini golf and free parking just outside the entrance.The room was spacious and comfortable, with good AC, a decent bathroom, wifi access, and a balcony (saluted by the poor backpacker needing to do laundry, clothes dried within the hour).The location is very good if you're travelling by car, as the hotel is easily accessible. If you're on foot, however, you might find the 15-20 minutes walk to the city center annoying,especially if you, like us, are travelling during summer, which is likely to see temperatures above 40°C.In conclusion, this hotel gives excellent value for money. Go for it!",Asty Hotel
50,"Best hotel ever. Really very, very friendly, helpful staff. All day you can have coffee, tea, sweets, fruits, snacks, refreshments for free. We were invited for a barbecue (absolutely delicious!) were everything was also for free, drinks included. When we wanted to go to the university, to center, bus station, wherever, someone from the hotel gave us a lift (price included). Rooms are spacious with very nice and clean bathroom. We had lovely view to the mountains. The neighborhood is very quiet (embassy area). We really enjoyed our stay and we will recommend this hotel to everyone.",Asty Hotel
40,"Stayed here for one night on our tour of Cyprus .its a 30 min walk into the centre so very convenient , the room was large and clean but dated , I don't know why I even mention that bu some people seem to care ! Al I want in a hotel is safe clean convenient and reasonable price . After all there only to sleep in ! Its go good wifi in room and a fridge ! And a first for me in any hotel I've ever stayed at us there is a dining room open 24 hrs and you can go in there ny time and help yourself to tea coffee fruit cakes fruit juice and it was lovely ,,, even Kelly's and other puddings in the fridges ! And all free ! Breakfast was nivpce and plentiful ! The staff were fantastic and sent a fax for me and refused any payment ! Paid €65 euros so not cheap but really good . Would stay gin and recommend ,",Asty Hotel
40,"We stayed at the Asty for two nights in late June. The staff were very accommodating. We got the ""colour suite"", which was a large top floor room with outdoor terrace and nice view of the city. The color scheme was funky. Reminiscent of an apartment painted by hippies in early 1970s, but quite cheerful. Reasonably priced at 65 euros a night. We got to peek inside the ""zebra suite"" next door before leaving. Wild. The downstairs dining room has complimentary food and non-alcoholic beverages available to guests 24 hours a day. They had a nice rice pudding in the fridge. The hotel is in reasonably quiet area within walking distance from city center (if not too hot).",Asty Hotel
50,"Our experience at the Asty hotel was wonderful!!We were treated as family members and felt our every need was met with respectand a great deal of courtesy. Mike Antoniades, the co owner of the Asty, was always available and timely with a smile and pleasant conversation.My family and I enjoyed the large breakfast we received each morning, the bike rides through the neighborhood, swimming at the community pool, shops and dining all just a few blocks away.The crown jewel of the Asty is the recreation facilities found in the basement. Ping pong, pool, exercise equipment, and games.There was so much to do we could hardly fit it into one week.Thanks again Mike and we would recommend the Asty to all of our friends in the future.Thanks. Jeff Berger",Asty Hotel
50,"My friend and I went to Asty recently and we really enjoyed our stay there ! The rooms are spacious, the food is really nice and available anytime, which is amazing when you arrive late and hungry at night !And above all, everybody was super friendly and chatty, we could even book a mini bus (price included !!!) to go around Nicosia.I would definitely come back there in the future if I travel in Cyprus again !",Asty Hotel
50,"The Asty Hotel provides 5* facilities and partly even more than that (cf. the minibus that brings you to the center, to university,...). Besides the 'normal things' like clean rooms, you'll get exceptional service from a very friendly and enthousiastic staff, nice events like a barbecue, a safe, quiet and central area, just 15 min. walking from the center, large breakfast with eggs and bacon if you like, nescafe at the room and coffee and other drinks/food 24 hours at your disposal,..., more than you can ever expect in this price category. In fact, NOT choosing the Asty Hotel would be irrational behaviour. You don't find the facilities the hotel offers at any other place. The minibus is of course extremely helpful for people that (for instance) have to go to university, as I did.",Asty Hotel
30,"The owners/employees were amazing... super nice and accommodating! I'd never been to a hotel where the kitchen was open 24 hours for self service, really convenient!The only thing to keep in mind if you stay here is to not expect much from the hotel/rooms themselves - they look and feel very dated, from the 1970s. Also, I needed a cab to get to anywhere (meetings/dinners/etc.).",Asty Hotel
50,"Taking part in the ISSEI Conference at the beginning of July 2012, I stayed at the Asty Hotel for four nights. I chose the hotel based on its positive reviews on tripadvisor, and once again I have not been disappointed.The room I was given was not special in terms of its look - however, it was quite big, very clean, quiet, equipped with everything one needs (fridge, hair dryer...), had a balcony and the free WIFI was fast and reliable. The price was increadibly cheap, compared to most other Nicosia hotels. The breakfast buffet left nothing to be desired. There were bread, eggs, fruits, all kind of sweet stuff, in a pleasent ambience with much space. The best thing about the Asty Hotel is its great service, however. Michael, the owner, and all of the staff are very kind and go to considerable length to help you. Guests are invited to help themselves to beverages, fruits, yoghurts and so on whenever they are in the hotel (for free!). Together with some other participants of the conference, I was driven to the university every morning and picked up every afternoon. When I wanted to visit the city center at the last day of my stay, Michael was glad to give me a ride as well (all for free!). There even was a complimentary barbeque one evening with really tasty food.All in all, I very much enjoyed my stay at the Asty Hotel and can recommend it to everybody who comes to Nicosia.",Asty Hotel
40,"I traveled to Cyprus two times in the last two months. I chose Asty the first time, because of things that I had heard about it and it turned out even better than I had expected. The staff were indeed helpful and they tried their best to assist every one of us. The breakfast was good and an open buffet for entire day was available to all. In my first stay in Asty, I asked the manager for a room away from street and he gave me just what I wanted. The same thing happened the second time I stayed there, although I had to stay one night in another room, my room was changed to a better one next day.I my second stay, I had also an interesting experience. The check out time of the hotel is noon, but since I had a business to take care of in the afternoon of my last day of stay, I asked the manager to let me stay until 4 O'clock and not only he kindheartedly agreed but also offered me a ride to Kapnos Shuttle station (airport) that is with any standard really far away from Hotel. It was not the first time I used the free taxi. I used it many times during my stay and it saved me a lot of money. I want to thank all the staff and Michael for the lovely stay that I had in their hotel and if I go back to Cyprus, I would definitely stay there again.",Asty Hotel
40,"We were 'upgraded' to the Zebra room -- truly an experience as it's decorated completely in a zebra motif. Beyond that, the hotel was clean, the staff was very helpful. The location is good, you can walk into the old city (if it's not 106 degrees when you get there like it was when we were there). The staff even let us keep our bags in our room on our check out day to keep them safe and out of the heat since they didn't need the room until later in the day. There is a great little market across the street as well. Definitely worth staying at.",Asty Hotel
40,"me and a colleague have been staying at Asty for 5 days as we had work trip in Nicosia.It wasn't long before I understood I made the best choice!We had two big, clean and recently renovated rooms at the top floor, with a great open view.The staff is always friendly and helpful, which is think is really the highlight of this place.We had a nice free barbecue as we arrived on saturday night, what a great welcome!The location is 10 mins from the center, very convenient and in a nice quiet residential area. We often took the free bikes to ride to the walled city.Well, I suggest that you don't look any further and totally go for Asty Hotel !Laura from Italy",Asty Hotel
50,"One of the most fun rooms I've stayed in, anywhere. Upon arrival, we took an upgrade to the'zebra suite' - in which EVERYTHING was based on the zebra motif: couch, rug, bins, cushions, blankets, furniture, wall art, magazine holders, curtains, figurines..... It was ridiculous, of course, but a lot of fun.Beyond that, the staff were extremely friendly. Breakfast was good, in a nice relaxed room (and they insisted we take some fruit with us for the day). Parking was covered and free. The view was over Nicosia. It wasn't in the middle of the old part of town, but the walk was short (or they have a drop-off service) & even shorter ifyou have a car.It reminded me of other hotels in the middle east of central asia, which don't look amazing on the outside, but retain a real charm once inside.",Asty Hotel
50,"This is a wonderful calm hotel for passing time, very friendly and comfortable, well equipped, nice and helpful staff and manager, very good and more than enough breakfast, friendly lobby.The hotel has some bicycle in which you can borrow and goes around",Asty Hotel

Asty offers a humble setting with very clean laundry linen, clean surroundings, comfortable showers; all one expects in a room on holiday or business trip.The Management and stuff do their best to accommodate anything you will need with a smile and kind approach.They offered free service when possible and I was invited to a Bar-B-Q on the house!!....that was cooked with love by the Manager and stuff themselves. It felt just like home cooking!I highly will recommend to my friends and family!Thank you all at Asty...I hope we shall meet again!",Asty Hotel

50,"This hotel should be rated at 5 stars. There is a gym, the people are the friendliest you can find and we couldn't believe our ears when during check in they said that they provide free minibus services in the area of Nicosia, have free wifi in all rooms, and has a fridge with refreshments and food including coffee, rice puddings, fruit, coffee and much more available for the customers 24hr free of charge and also offered us a complimentary BBQ dinner on saturday night just because the hotel was full for the weekend. It's the best of the best.",Asty Hotel
50,"The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. They give you rides into town if you ask, but it's also easy walking distance (~20 minutes to Old City). The decor is a little outdated but all the bathroom fixtures are new, new TV, everything is spotless clean. Fine selection of breakfast options that will appeal to Americans, Europeans, and Middle Easterners. Street is quiet, free parking, free bikes, and great views of the mountains. Definitely recommend!!",Asty Hotel
50,"This hotel treats visitors as very welcome guests.The hotel itself is smart and clean having clearly benefitted from on going investment year on year.Staff and owners are polite, helpful, and generous to a fault, for example there is an all day breakfast buffet to dip into whenever you feel like it, a shuttle bus is available if the short walk into town is too far( less than 2k), otherwise bikes are available.Add in free wifi and a commitment to ensuring you get the most from your stay in Nicosia.Truly a pleasure!Peter & Marlene, UK",Asty Hotel

Large bathroom with nice shower and large bath.Breakfast was great! A large selection of cereals, pastries, fruit, delicatessen foods (ham, cheese etc) and hot breakfast cooked to order. The bar was open 24 hours and tea and coffee were on the house.The hotel isn't in the most touristic setting, but a short taxi ride away from the town center and main attractions. We were very impressed by how cheap taxis were in Nicosia, and how quick and easy it was to get to/from our hotel.Recommended, especially at this price!",Asty Hotel

The stuff was really nice and helpfull, especially one young girl that speaks more than one languages. The breakfast was ok.The price is approchable.It is not far from the city. They have a mini-van for the guests of the hotel for free and at my last day, they left me to the bus station.",Asty Hotel
20,I had the night from hell as we came in very tired from a long bus ride and the lobby was filled with cigarette smoke which lingered in the halls. The hotels overall image was not as they had advertised and I couldn't wait to get to Limasol to get some rest away from the rude staff. Yes I say rude when they argue with guests. They seem to have the impression that it is the best hotel in Nicosia. Well the pipes in the showers made this howling noise before dirty water came out if you tried to use hot water. Our overall feeling was after being woken up three times during the night that we were getting what we paid for and was beyond exhaustion to argue with the staff anymore.,Asty Hotel
50,"You couldn't ask for nicer people. Arrived at 9am and they made a room ready for me and gave me a free breakfast. Drove me into centro two mornings, provide juice and snacks 24 hours a day. I had a midnight snack of rice pudding. Went to the bar at 10pm and asked for a beer, which was provided on the house. Their generosity is paid back in gratitude.Room was nice. Not luxurious, but very comfortable and a good deal for the money. Wifi worked very well. Highly recommended the hotel, even though it is a mile or two away from centro. Since they drive you into town it isn't a problem.",Asty Hotel
50,"My husband and I recently spent three days at The Asty hotel and were very pleased with everything. The staff, including the owner, were always friendly and helpful, even taking us places in their own cars. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the location convenient to the places that we wanted to see and the food couldn't have been better. Snacks and drinks were available at any time of the day and we always felt completely safe at this hotel. We hope to go back next year and I would certainly stay there again.",Asty Hotel
50,"If you want excellent service, staff with a smile or a place to just to relax and still being in the middle of the city's action, Asty hotel should be definitely your choice!!!Booked through booking.com a single room for two days on same day with check in. Greeted with a smile by a nice gentleman. I went to the room that had everything i needed and i was told that i could get any time 24/7 water coffee and fruit. He even suggested to make me something to eat if i didn't want to go out.Room had a refrigerator, lcd tv, airconditioning, coffee making facilities and coffee and tea. Complimentary water, toiletries, a shower, safe, a big bed etc.I did not have breakfast as i left early for work but i finished early and chose to lose my booking of another day, however the nice lady at the reception only charged me the night i stayed with no penalty on my reservation.I will definitely recommend!",Asty Hotel
50,"This is the friendliest hotel we have stayed in.The rooms are large ,clean and comfortable.The bahroom is also clean and has a good shower.The hotel is about 20 miutes walk from the centre and in a nice quiet area.We came back well after midnight and the area didn't seem dangerous as I had read in reviews.The helpfulness and friendliness of the staff and owner are what made this hotel special for us.The car that takes you to and fro, the coffee,juice etc which is available with no extra charge.The breakfast was a buffet with unlimited variety and when we arrived we had a very late lunch.Good home cooked food and good value for money.If your a tourist you should try it so as to experience typical greek food.A really enjoyable stay.",Asty Hotel
20,"my review of the asty consists of two main concerns. you get what you pay for and while the price is lower than the other larger hotels in Nicosia.. it doesn't come close to being a place where I would ever want to come again. Its too far away from everything and to walk into town is not a good idea. You should be prepared for the noise was loud from the avenue and another couple refused to stay with us - you don't get friendly service that you get in a bigger hotel. This is in my opinion a small poor hotel that survives off online bookings from people that have never been there. Well I stayed here and wish i could have spent my money at a better place but there was comfortable but there was nothing i could do about it. I had a great time in the center of the city which is very beautiful, but I dreaded leaving and when you arrive back to the asty - it is like you are in the bad side of town. - Reba 2012",Asty Hotel
50,"We stayed at the Asty while visiting our daughter who was doing a semester abroad in Cyprus. We got the 'Zebra' room and while we chuckled over the theme aspects of the room, we loved how large it was. The bed was extremely comfortable, the room has a sitting area with couch & chairs, a large balcony, small refrigerator, and plenty of room to spread out. Everything was very clean, loved the free WiFi which offered great connections whether you were on the 5th floor balcony, the front patio, the breakfast room, or throughout. The neighborhood was mostly residential, quiet and safe, and I'm extremely puzzled on how a couple reviews mention a bad, unsafe area (Huh?) We rode the free bicycles around the area and saw all the embassies, churches, and other sites. Walking both day & night, we never felt unsafe or that it was in a bad area. The free hotel shuttle bus saved us some serious Euros and they graciously brought us into the City Center for sightseeing, to the bus station to connect with buses heading to Ayia Napa and Larnaca, to the campus where our daughter was studying, and to the crossing border to catch a Turkish taxi to Ercane Airport for our flight to Istanbul. I highly recommend the Asty as a great place to stay. While I love fancy hotels as much as the next person, it's hard for me to spend the 100's of Euros more when the Asty provides such a clean, large, welcoming place to stay with a great breakfast, free shuttle, bikes to borrow, and a great, friendly, and helpful staff.",Asty Hotel
50,"This is a very familiar hotel, where you truly feel at home! Rooms are very clean and with big balconies. Free WI-FI in all areas, access to fruits drinks and coffee all day, very good breakfast, free parking, free bicycle hire. About 20 min on foot from the old town and 5 min bike ride. For the price you can't really ask for more! This Hotel is in the embassy area, a very relaxed area.",Asty Hotel
10,this was not what we expected - not at all what we had hoped would be 3 day vacation -would rate the property a 3 (fair) the service a 1 (hostile) the area 1 (bad) the cleanliness 4 (good) and the value 2 (poor),Asty Hotel
40,"Our second visit in this 3 star hotel. Don't expect 5 * luxury but you can be positive of the owner's constant care, service with a smile by all - thank god - cypriot personnel, a spacious, clean, tidy room . Located in an upscale residential area, 10 mins drive to city centre by free shuttle hotel mini bus . Free 24 hr coffee and juice in the breakfast room. Breakfast very good and generous. Try the confectionery just opposite this hotel and the tavern 100 metres further down (Pampos) where you can get a 25 dish meze series of plates packed with local goodies @ 19 euros per person. Unbelievable quality and regretfully quantity enough for a whole family..Cons: smoking of one receptionist though prohibited. Our room had the smell of sewage and this was reported to reception.",Asty Hotel
40,"One last surprise before we wen't back home.Booked it online (5 people, 2 rooms).Great place, room's feel a bit old but has everything. Nice shower.The surprise was the ""All-day-dining-room"" method they have,the dining room is open all day and all night, you can always grab something to eat/drink (even cakes, fruits, snacks, juices, hot drinks etc...).The breakfast was very good.Nice staff.There is even a mini-golf on the roof.Only problem was finding it, but the second we got there - it was very good.Would definitely recommend it to travelers on tight budget / searching a place to rest before a flight.",Asty Hotel
50,We really liked this place and the owner is extremely friendly. He saw us walking back to the hotel in the opposite direction from him and stopped and gave us a ride back anyway going out of his way. It is within walking distance of downtown and there was a free minibus as well. It was very clean and we had the novel zebra room which is just how it sounds. Highly recommended!,Asty Hotel
50,"It was a pleasure to stay at the Asty hotel. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed on our short 1 night stay.The hotel is situated about a 15-20min walk from the city center but they provide a complimentary mini bus service that will run you into town which we did take advantage of.As we had a rental car having free parking available at the hotel was great as was free wireless internet access throughout the building - always a massive positive for me when choosing a hotel.We stayed in one of their executive rooms and it was large, clean and bright with a good sized balcony overlooking the city.It's not the the most luxurious hotel but you're really made to feel at home, the staff and service are great and it provides excellent value for money. I would highly recommend the Asty Hotel to anyone wishing to stay in the city.",Asty Hotel
40,"I agree with the majority of reviewers in that the hotel staff are among the friendliest and most helpful I have met. From the free welcome beer to the free ride to the old city, I couldn't find fault. We stayed in a 3 bed room which, I suppose, some fussy reviewers might say was dated but it didn't bother us. And yes, breakfast is good! I would certainly stay here again.",Asty Hotel
50,"I’m a student, and I went in Cyprus for Erasmus program, so I didn’t know anybody and any places, when I arrived in Asty hotel mr Michael and his staff help me in each way to feel confortable in the hotel. They brought me to the university 2 times, and I had a bicycle to move independently at any time, everything for free (the center is 10 minutes by bike).The second night they invited every guest for a bbc buffet, drinks included, and that dinner was very (very) good.The breakfast is rich and the guest are also welcome to drink coffee, thè or eat yogurt and cereals or cakes at any time in the dinning room 24H per day.They provided me several usefull staff, like a map of Nicosia, a turistic guide also in my languages , Italian ecc..Is very funny the mini golf on the roof!My room was clean big and I could turn on the ac for free any time. The staff is incredibly kind and friendly and they created a familiary atmosphere.It's a great value for money.",Asty Hotel

Large and clean room, friendly people (family run), shuttle service on demand to center (not from center), free juices, fruits and biscuits 24/7, a lot of choices (buffet) at breakfast, you can choose almost everything from chips to home made jam in any quantity you wish.By bus, 10 minutes from center, walking (I am a fast walker!) 25 to 35 minutes depending from where you start.",Asty Hotel
50,"There's so much to say about this family-owned hotel. The service is exceptional. We felt comfortable as soon as we walked in. We'd read about the wonderful hospitality on TripAdvisor and it's true.They offer a great breakfast including eggs but they also offered a delicious dinner on Sunday night when many restaurants were closed. Michael, one of the owners, is so helpful in terms of where to go, what to do and he'll drive you there and pick you up! Priceless.We enjoyed it so much that we drove back to Nocosia and stayed our last night at the Asty. Great time there.The decor in the rooms is a bit dated, but it's clean.",Asty Hotel
50,"My mum and I stayed in quite a few hotels on our trip to Cyprus and Asty Hotel was our favourite!The hotel is situated in a quiet area of Nicosia, but access to the Old Town is easy as there is a bus running past the hotel. Plus, the hotel offers a free shuttle service to its clients, so you can always get a lift that way.The staff are friendly and helpful, and you'll have access to maps and pamphlets at reception. Our room was very comfortable and affordable.The hotel includes many facilities, such as a downstairs gym, a lounge area, as well as free internet. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful. You can choose from various cereals and other items, or get a hot breakfast made to order (we loved this option). An added bonus is that the breakfast room is stocked with snacks and a coffee machine, which you can use all day. A nice touch for coffee addicts like us!When we left Nicosia, the hotel shuttle took us directly to our bus stop. The driver assured us that if anything went wrong elsewhere on our trip in Cyprus, we would be welcome to give Asty Hotel a call. This just proves that the hotel goes above and beyond what it needs to.I would definitely stay at the hotel again.",Asty Hotel

Yunus and Nadia Suleman",Asty Hotel
50,"This hotel is worth writing a review about. You will not be sorry if you stay here. The owner and staff are genuinely friendly and very helpful. The place is clean and the food is very good. You can use the bicycles to ride into the old part of town or take the hotel shuttle bus. The rooms, bathrooms and common areas are all very clean. The hotel has many cozy places to hang out. The breakfast is good and plentiful and you will have access to the dining area at all times to get drinks and snacks. Try the homemade rice pudding! There is also free wifi and nice tvs in the rooms.",Asty Hotel
50,"My husband and I and a couple friends stayed in the Asty Hotel. It was clean, people were friendly and the food was great. We were able to rent bicycles for the day free (I think). It was just pleasant in many ways. What ever we may have needed they helped us with. The breakfast was huge and they were more than happy to cook eggs and other items. The coffee was available all day and it was very good as well. If you are looking for a modern upscale place, this may not be what you are looking for, but it was a very nice place to stay. The view from the front rooms is really nice. You look out above the buildings and see beautiful mountains. I also felt safe there. We were very pleased with our stay at the Asty and if we returned to Cyprus and Nicosia we would most likely enjoy another stay at the Asty.",Asty Hotel
40,"I was given a fantastic room, (rm 506) spacious, clean, modern and a very welcome smile by Costas. . Everything was in order. Nothing special about the hotel, very basic but clean , located in an upmarket residential area ten minutes drive from the city centre. Very very willing hotel owner and staff to help, can drive you to the centre on their shuttle mini bus , or assist in every possible way. Bicycles are also available if you wish to ride in this lovely and spotlessly clean city.Very rich buffet breakfast even including fried eggs & bacon. Abundant toiletries. Overall, I felt at home with excellent service. The breakfast room is open 24 hours where guests can have coffee, soft drinks , cakes etc any time with no charge !!! Just before my trip to the high mountains, the owner proposed to prepare a pack with cakes, soft drinks etc. Unbelievable!!.Negative: One of the receptionists WAS SMOKING every time I saw him, though prohibited, against the law in Cyprus, and the property being a non smoking hotel.",Asty Hotel
40,"The Asty in Nicosia should be known as the number 1 in personal attention. Owner Michael and his staff went out of their way to make our stay in Nicosia easy and informative. Close to the town center..food and beverages available 24hrs. If you want upscale decor this may not be for you..if you want great value, good location and personal attention: Stay at the Asty!Susan & Doug, PA.",Asty Hotel
50,"Very good hotel, it is a three star (I guess), but the service is a five star. Good position in quiet and safe bussiness and embassy area, close to old-town walls - 25 minutes of walk, or you can take a bus No. 259 (stop near hotel). There is a big patisserie (supermarcet) just across the street, great reastaurant nearby - allways fully booked - with traditional Cyprus style Mezze. Excellent staff, great breafast - good variety of food, freshly made eggs as you wish, at saturday free complimentary Cyprus-style barbecue (free food + free drinks). Very fast and stable free Wi-Fi. Fantastic Mr. Owner/Manager - (thank you for your hospitality and help) - allways helpful, gives lot of advices, helps to arrange car-hire, another hotel in Cyprus etc...., He took us to bus station, university, or to other near places by hotel minibus - at anytime and of course for free. The rooms (at least, which I stayed in) have a bit older furniture (wooden furniture, wooden panelling), but on the other hand, what I want to say, the rooms are very comfortable, cosy, spacy, so you will feel there better than in super-modern-super-small rooms full of modern plastic or glass based materials. The rooms are in general very well equipped - flat TV, hair-dryer, air-con, electric kettle with complimentary tea, coffee, and big bottle of water, in the bathroom you can find some basic amenities like shapoo, shower gel, soap, kids-sponge etc... This was my second stay in Nicosia (first time in hotel Classic) and I will definitely come again to Asty hotel.",Asty Hotel
40,"Room was very comfortable, with a nice little balcony. The service was excellent, and only one clerk had trouble understanding english, but in the end I managed to get my message across fine. Free water/tea/wifi. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Big tv with lots of channels for the time you wanted to relax. Had its own fridge where you could put your drinks and food but for some reason one of the plugs was converted to EU standard so you could either have the TV on, or the fridge on which was a bit weird, but wasn't much of a problem as I had a 2-way travel plug-converter with me.",Asty Hotel
50,"I was in Asty Hotel for 2 nights and I have to state only positive comments. It is value of money hotel in a very quite place that in the same time is so near to the city center as well to the business area. The main advantage of the hotel is the service which is excellent. The rooms are among the biggest rooms you can find, rich breakfast and people who are ready to help you. I would like also to mention that I forgot to the room a very valuable item and 2 hours after the check-out the owner of the hotel himself call me mentioning that it is on the reception. It is a highly recommended hotel.",Asty Hotel
50,"This family owned hotel is a bit old but clean and functional. The manager Mr. Michel is very nice and helpful as most Cypriots. When we arrived we got a standard room that was a bit worn but ok for the price. Before we had unpacked Mr. Michel called and offered us an upgrade to a superior room with balcony at no extra charge. This was a very nice junior sweat designed in Zebra style. This was one of our best hotel experiences and trust me I have had thousands of hotel nights in my life. The breakfast, included, was very nice with many choices and also coffee, juice and such could be used all day free of charge. This is really the place to stay in Nicosia. We were also offered to be driven anywhere in the hotel minibus but we had own car so used that.",Asty Hotel
50,Staff is very kind and attentive; we got a room on the 4th floor which was quite big; the bathroom looked very clean (as if it had been renovated recently); big plasma tv in the room; decent buffet breakfast; private car parking place at the back of the hotel; good rate!,Asty Hotel
40,"On research finding that Nicosia isn't swamped with hotels - plumped for the Asty, even though 20 mins walk from the city centre. First off the hotel was comfortable and could not find fault with the room or service we experienced. The bedroom was large with air con and very clean. The reception area with large lounge areas was welcoming and clean. Hotel offered a wide ranging buffet breakfast - find hard to beat in other mid rang hotels. Reception staff very helpful and will help with any information - additionally the reception area plenty of tourist information available. We were driving so the distance from city centre was not an issue. The value was exceptional for the service provided. Would recommend.",Asty Hotel
50,"Since it is an advising section; I would like to confirm that Asty is a comfortable, spacious, clean, hospitable hotel to stay at in Cyprus. We stayed in a 3 bed room, with TV (at least 5 English channels, News and Movies) Fridge, AC, good light, comfortable beds, hair dryer, mirror, closet and commode with 3 drawers. They offered a delicious breakfast, a huge variety! There is a huge reception room nicely decorated. The price is affordable! And to add to it all, they even took us with their minivan to a cruise around the town and they dropped us by the borders (FREE of CHARGE!) It is situated close by the American Embassy, and there is a bakery close by as well! So if you are in Cyprus, do not think twice, ASTY is the place to stay!",Asty Hotel
40,"the people are nice,the hotel is clean and the breakfirst is good.we liked the service like bicycles for free wifi in the hole area and a minibus that brings you to the center (3km)",Asty Hotel
50,"Location-wise this was incredibly suitable for me. If you have business at the Russian or American Embassy then this is your choice as you will find no parking at the embassies and this hotel is about 3 minutes of walk. As for what you get, you really should not expect so much for the price paid but all was ok. Room was ok, breakfast was hot, not much variety but ok. Hot shower and comfortable bed. If you have a night to spend in the capital and have no-where to stay you could do a lot worse than the Asty. Free wi-fi, not normal for this price, but normal for capital city hotels. Big plus for business users. A proper business center would be nice but the staff were helpful for prining stuff. The staff try to be as helpful as they can because they want people to return, which is good. Would suggest to friends.",Asty Hotel
10,"Was greeted by the reception by a very unfriendly person. Gave me the keys and without apologising or even looking at me told me I had to change the next day from room again.Nice staff from Bulgaria/Rumania. Breakfast is overlooked by a bouncer. No a la carte menu in the evening, just food of the day. Our food was paid for by the client so they saved on ingredients (judging with what other tables got) Seems they also sell rooms per hour.Rooms are big, but old fashioned sometimes broken airco, strange smell, torn walls etc.For the same rates you should be able to get better (and more near the centre).",Asty Hotel
40,"We went to Cyprus for our honeymoon and we had booked Asty thru the net. The service was good and they were very prompt. The rooms were small and cosy but it had a family touch. There are very few rooms, and we ended up making friends with a lot of people there. It is walking distance from the old city, museum and the market too. loads of small n nice places to eat. Would love to be back in Asty",Asty Hotel
50,I have stayed in many hotels in the world both for business and pleasure but this is by far the friendliest and hospitable I have ever stayed in. I'd would highly recommend it.,Asty Hotel
40,"The staff was super friendly!!! You have access to the coffee machine, fresh fruit and cookies etc. 24/7 for free! In addition they have a pool table and darts etc. (which we didn't use) and free wireless. The only downside was the location - at least a 20 minutes walk into the old city, although parking was much easier this way. The room was clean, although the decoration seemed a little old-fashioned. Huge flat screen though with international channels. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel!!",Asty Hotel
50,"I stayed at this nice hotel for a week at the begining of March 2011. I was really very surprised with it's great location (it's just about 15 minutes to go from the hotel to the city centre on foot). Also the staff of the hotel are so kind all the time and friendly atmosphere is everywhere. You really feel yourself like at home from the time of your check in till the time of your check out!! In addition, for sure, about the room rates! Prices are too profitable for such a good hotel!! Breakfast is also good with a big variety of gold and hot dishes. I was really to satisfied with my accomodation at Asty Hotel and next time I will choose Asty definitely!",Asty Hotel

30,"I stayed at this hotel while on business. It''s basic, but good value for money. Clean, rooms with ac-mini bar and tv, with very big public areas and internet access everywhere, at no extra cost!The neighbourhood is very nice and is near embassies, which comes in handy when you are visiting for a visa.If you're not looking for luxury, this is where to stay",Asty Hotel
40,"If you're staying in Nicosia and want good value for money, find your way to the Asty. The hotel is run by a friendly Cypriot family who are well accustomed to dealing with English travellers. The staff were friendly and willing to help whenever I needed anything, the lounge is a comfortable place to rest or plan your day and most importantly, the hotel offers computers and wireless hotpoints on every floor. Situated near the city centre, the Asty is a convenient place to stop off and rest when you visit Nicosia. Give it a try!Alex de Moller",Asty Hotel

40,"A quite convenient hotel easy to find in south east of Nicosia. Then, you can go down to the old city within 20 to 25 mn walk.The room are big which is very nice and different from what is usually the case in Cyprus.And the price is really affordable. A good choice.",Asty Hotel
10,I feared for my life in this hotelI would not recommend it to anyone,Asty Hotel
10,"The (N)Asty Hotel, should be avoided at all costs unless you really don't want to spend any money. It looks like it hasn't been updated in about a million years and to add to this when I looked upon the dismal furnishings in the smoke smelling dank room, a cockroach ran out of the bathroom. Disgusting.",Asty Hotel
