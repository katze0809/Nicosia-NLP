50,The room was clean and good-looking and the staff kindly and customer oriented. Location is good also (near the main bus station). The ratio quality/price was very good. At least for a solo traveler is a good choice.,Delphi Hotel
30,"Great position next to the bus station and minutes walk from Ledra street and the border crossing into Turkish Cyprus. The hotel is clean but very basic, staff are friendly and very helpful. A little noisy at night but it’s position is worth it.",Delphi Hotel
40,"We only stayed one night in Nicosia and for us the location was the most important thing - so close (a few steps) from main bus station and city centre. The room was fine, we also had a fridge. The staff is very friendly, smiling and helpful. The only thing I would change is the glass door to the bathroom - that might be a bit uncomfortable when you're travelling with friends.",Delphi Hotel
50,"Very good, nice staff. One downside is very noisy at night due to the fact that it is located in the beside of cafes and restaurants. Тhe hotel itself is not expensive, you can spend the night in it, it justifies its price. The advantages of the hotel is that everything is close by.",Delphi Hotel
50,"Hospitable staff. Clean rooms, good value for money. Would go back again. They are going to be serving breakfast soon. Couldn’t ask for a better location. Just beside the bus station and the old town is within easy walking distance.",Delphi Hotel
50,"The location of Delphi Hotel is excellent; it is situated in one minute walking distance from bus station and 7 minutes walking distance from Ledra street where there are places to eat. Our room was clean and there was proper air-conditioning and also a fridge. Very good value for money.There is no elevator so you may have to climb some stairs; we didn't mind, but it may be important to another guest. At the period we visited there were works taking place at the main square in front of the hotel so it could be a bit noisy at times.",Delphi Hotel
50,"Could not find a better hotel. Ever since I first came across it and visited I have never stayed at another hotel in Nikosia and that is not because I cannot afford it but because I like the people who run and own it. They are all genuinely nice, kind and helpful fellows and ones you can rely on for whatever questions and worries you might have regarding your trip. You feel cared for and not just the next customer.You basically have all you need and you are in the very center of Nicosia with superb transport connections.",Delphi Hotel
30,"I stayed 2 separate nights in this hotel and I would rate 3.5 stars for my first night and 2.5 stars for my second night. So, on average I rate 3 stars.Good points:1. Unbeatable location: 50 meters from the intercity station, 3 mins walk to Lendra street. 7 mins walk to the border crossing and 20 mins easy walk to the Girne gate (the intercity combo station for Northern Cyprus).2. Clean and Tidy.3. Staff are helpful and friendly.4. Almost the only budget stay in NicosiaBad points:1. After reading the reviews, I expected a tiny room and toilet. The room that I stayed for my first night is tiny but still I can at least move a bit in the toilet. But for the room that I stayed in the second night, I can't even sit on the toilet seat probably as there is no space for me to sit on !!2. Quite noisy at night.3. The smell of the cleanser that the cleaners used had a strange smell.4. The room is bright for my first night but dim for my second night.5. No lift for the hotel.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Great hotel, I was expecting a ""mass tourism"" hotel given how close it is to the bus station, turns out it's family owned with very friendly owners. At the edge of the Old City and walking distance to Ledras street and the border. Recommended.",Delphi Hotel
40,Serves its function – small hotel right above the central bus station. Our room was comfortable and clean. Price was very reasonable. Excellent location practically for any purpose of visit in Nicosia – except maybe if you have a car and need to park. The never ending works in the newly constructed public area in the moat of the Old City walls (on top of which this hotel practically stands) cause some noise starting in the early morning so until they finish… ask for a room not facing south if you are a light sleeper. We paid about 35 EU per night so for this cost I think we definitely got what we needed.,Delphi Hotel
50,"We are happy with the whole staff, they were very accommodating and helpful throughout our stay. The owner is a genuinely nice guy who even recommended us places to eat and visit. The location was absolutely central and it was easy to navigate around the city from and to the hotel.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Good location, rooms can be very comfortable. If there is a problem in the room they can fix it pretty quickly. Right next to the bus station. Very handy to explore many cities by bus. No lift, it can be difficult if you have heavy luggage.",Delphi Hotel
50,"From the outside, it looked doubtful if Delphi Hotel was even an inhabited building. While the building can use an upgrade, the interior and the room was kept spotless. The room was very basic but had a fridge, private bathroom, TV, and passable wifi. The location with the central bus station just out of the doorstep cannot be beat. Everything in the old city (even on the northern side) was within walking distance also. As I ended up using the Intercity Bus and local bus routes several times, this ended up being a great base for Nicosia.",Delphi Hotel
50,Great friendly place close to Ledra Street for border crossing and viewing the old walled City.Staff were great and I visited on 2 separate occasions. Rooms basic but clean and each with balcony access. Lot of work going on outside on the new square but didn't bother me in the slightest.,Delphi Hotel
50,Right in the centre of Nicosia and within 5-10 minutes walk of the border. Close to many restaurants and main shopping area. Bright accommodation with all amenities that you would need. Very clean and well run by the lovely owners and their cheerful night staff.,Delphi Hotel
40,"This hotel is in an ideal location if you are travelling by public transport around Cyprus, or to and from airports. You literally step out of the main entrance an you are 50 yards away from the main bus terminal in Nicosia. It is right in the heart of the main area for shopping and restaurants.The hotel is old, but is clean and has en suite facilities. This was my 3rd stay at this hotel, and the staff are always friendly, helpful and welcoming",Delphi Hotel
50,"Awesome location (20 meter from central bus station), close to the shopping district, 5 min walk to the Turkish side. Cozy rooms with great balconies, although no elevators in. Would definitely recommend.",Delphi Hotel
40,Great location you can see thei hotel when you get off the bus just round the corner from ledra street and all shops & bars. Very clean and comfortable with air conditioning staff very friendly nice bathroom,Delphi Hotel
30,"Near the intercity bus station, fast foods and shops. Roof terrace is useful to take pictures. Staff is kind and smiling. All of turistical sites are in walking distance. French bakery at the corner. Good value for money.",Delphi Hotel
50,"Location and price nice clean room, friendly staff.it was an over night stop over. Bus station is next to the main bus station. It would idea for hotel to have a bus time table for intercity bus service as there is no way of finding out after 7.pm The board with the timetable is taken away and the staff at bus office are unfriendly as it's a different company.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Right next to Solomou bus station, so very convenient and, therefore, central to all points of interest inside and outside the old city walls - taxis also stop outside. Very clean rooms, good wifi reception in the room, air conditioner in working order so heating available on a colder night. The tv worked but is all Greek, though the channels usually have subtitled English language films in the evening but there are more interesting things to do in Nicosia than watch telly. Staff friendly and helpful. There is no lift but a high room is recommended if you are at the front as there is traffic and building noise from the main street for the duration. The front room had a small balcony and there was a view of the city from here and a view of the mountains from the roof. The very top floor has a kitchen with adequate facilities to cook food. Walk-in rate of 40euros is reasonable rate for Nicosia - this is a price per room and obviously works out cheaper if shared as the rooms are mostly twin rooms.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Perfect hotel for exploring the city! Rooms are simple, but clean and have everything you need. The hotel is situated directly next to the bus station and with all important sights in walking distance. Very nice stuff - we could even leave our luggage there for some hours when we came back to Nicosia a few days later on our way home.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Excellent situated, practically next to the bus station. All tourist attractions are very close. The staff is very kind and the rooms are clean. What I did not like is that it is a bit noisy.It is not far from Ledra street and you can visit without difficulty the Northern part of the city as well. Fron there you have good connections to Kyrenia and Famagusta. And ist is not far from Larnaca (and airport).",Delphi Hotel
50,"Very friendly staff and situated conveniently for viewing the main Nicosia sites. The room was pleasant (if not spacious), clean and had a.c. and TV (although few English language channels. Very close to the main bus station.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Centrally located, right next to the walls of the Old City (Republic-side of the city). Friendly staff - we booked the wrong dates but they changed the booking without any cancellation costs involved. Rooms on the front side are a bit noisy, but the balcony door keeps most noise out. It's a pity there are only twin rooms, and no double rooms, but the staff is fine with mixing the beds into one.",Delphi Hotel
50,Stayed at Delphi mid September 2friends in 60 s on shopping trip to Nicosia Delphi basic but scrupulously clean owner / staff on reception excellent great value for money location just across from main bus depot and within walking distance main shopping area definitely use again if in Nicosia,Delphi Hotel
30,"Stayed 1 night after Cyprus vs Belgium in September, travelled up from Larnaca by bus (bus station outside hotel), this hotel suited us perfectly.The rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and helpful, no breakfast but numerous food outlets nearby.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Bus station and new Eleftheria square by Zaha Hadid (build in progress) can be seen from the balcony, but our room was not loud. Close to city centre. Room is with air condition, TV and fridge. Breakfast is not available but there are restaurants are around.",Delphi Hotel
50,"Well located in the very centre of the city, close to the bus station and Ledra street. Our room was enough spacious with balcony. City maps, fast wifi, nice staff. Everything was perfect. Many bars and restaurants around the hotel.",Delphi Hotel
30,"I have not stayed in this hotel but a friend of mine stayed here for one night recently and I dropped by to get her and go shopping together.I am writing a review because I liked its location. It suites definitely those who travel by bus and come to Solomou Square and those who cannot afford to stay in expensive hotels.The rooms are neat and tidy, not big but they are ok for a short stay.Downside:No Sound proofing roomsNo Lift",Delphi Hotel
40,"I stayed here for one night and was really impressed with the place given the price. The room and bathroom area were perfectly adequate. The only complaint was that there were ants by the fridge, but they didn't go anywhere else and could be easily removed. Otherwise it was very clean and comfortable place. The management were also really friendly and helpful and accommodated with late check out, which was really nice. All in all, if you aren't staying long and want something convenient and cheap, this is a great option.",Delphi Hotel
50,"The location is perfect, in the main center, just 30 seconds by walk to the main street and another 30 seconds to the main bus station XD. The place is nice, with terrace also, and the staff is absolutelly friendly and helpful.",Delphi Hotel
40,"I've stayed at Delphi twice and it is a great hotel idealy located in the heart of Nicosia. Their prices are hard to beat and the location (right next to Ledra street and right in front of the main bus station) is especially convenient.The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean, and the beds comfortable.If you are in a room facing the front of the hotel it can be a bit loud at night, but I'm pretty used to city noise so it wasn't too much of a problem for me.",Delphi Hotel
50,"Right a Central Bus station you find this hotel, which is also very near to the things one usually would like to visit in Nicosia. I did everything by foot.The room was light and friendly the bathroom small but still OK. My room had a little balcony overlooking the place near the busstation, which I found quite cool. Of course the room is not really quite, I think it´s ahotel for people who like city - life.THe service friendly and helpful.",Delphi Hotel
50,"Traveled with my two small children. The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. The room was very clean. Central location makes it easy to go to shops, restaurants, cafes, sights. Near inter-city bus station is a plus if you want to visit other cities. Overall great experience.",Delphi Hotel
50,"I stayed in Nicosia for a weekend to meet a friend and visit the cityCUSTOMER SERVICE: Excellent people, very welcoming and kind, provided me with all the info a tourist would need. Honestly I felt like home :))PRICE: Excellent price for the centre of Nicosia compared to other hotels.ROOM: Spacious, neat, tidy room, comfortable bed and lovely air condition heating and free wifi!LOCATION: Right in the centre of Nicosia, 1 minute's walk from the Central Bus Station (Solomou Square) and all the tourist attractions of the city.TOTALLY PLEASED :)",Delphi Hotel
50,"Despite the fact lonely planet says there is no choice in budget accomodations in Nikosia, we found the Delphi Hotel as a great place to stay. Rooms are clean. Sure you don't have to expect a palace, but there is everything you need. The staff is very friendly and helpful.The hotel is perfectly located.",Delphi Hotel
30,"The location was great for us, 3 minutes walking to the center of the city, 3 minutes walking to the nearby monitored parking place (at reasonable prices, 24 hrs at 5 EUR), close to shops, restaurants and points of interest. Room was of a sufficient size for two, furniture wasn't the oldest, but definitely already served a great number of customers and wouldn't mind renovation, A/C worked very well, bathroom was a bit smaller with a shower. Hotel staff was very pleasant and overall for the price 49 EUR / night it was worth what you get. I would definitely recommend it to guests who are planning to stay for a night or two, but probably not for longer stays.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Very convenient location in the heart of Nicosia- right by the bus station, easy to walk to museums and other main sights, very close to lots of wonderful restaurants and cafes! Only draw back to the location is that the room was quite noisy both at night and in the morning- don't expect a peaceful sleep. Simple, clean room and friendly staff always at the desk! As students, we choose this place for the reasonable price- 60 euro a night for the triple room.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Reasonably cheap by Nicosia standards. Next to the bus station, that also means pollution and noise. No breakfast at all. No Englısh channels on the TV. But pleasant room. Friendly staff. Cheap restaurant just 20 meters on the right.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Since my flight was coming in late in the day and I had to make my way from LCA to Nicosia and was planning to move on to Girne in Northern Turkey the next day, I was looking for a place to sleep, really. Delphi turned out to be perfect. It's central, right next to the main bus stop, a few steps from the main drag and key places of interest, a few minutes to the nearest border crossing. I had a very small, quiet room with a tiny bathroom and stable internet. The hotel was neat and the room very clean. George and Fifi were friendly, forthcoming hosts who were flexible about my time of departure the next day. So for 30 Euro I'd say this was a sweet deal.",Delphi Hotel
40,"Small room but clean.Cost effective but more expensive than hotels in other parts of Cyprus with bigger rooms.Hotel is just opposite the bus stop. So you don’t have to lug your luggage around.Near the shops, the museums, the old city walls, the green line; which makes sightseeing easy.Very small bathroom but clean. If they can figure out a way to keep the waste paper bin inside (maybe a shelf), you wouldn’t need to shift it from the room to the bathroom every night.While I was there, the staff was quite helpful. However, do keep in mind that if you are booking a room and you need a confirmation for your visa (like I did), you would need to book directly through the hotel’s website and not through booking.com. I had to cancel my booking through booking.com and book through the hotel website in order to get the hotel confirmation. Other than that, they were very co-operative.Unless you’re a family, it may be cheaper to take the airport shuttle into the city and then a cab to the hotel.",Delphi Hotel
50,"The hotel is very close to the city center and directly at the main bus station, where you arrive from other cities.The stuff was very nice and the rooms were clean. They also helped us and gave us additional beds in our rooms, because we were spontaneously a bit more people than planned.The onliest thing I did not like, was that the door to the bathroom, inside of the room was quite transparent, so you could watch your roommate sitting on the toilette...But all in all it was very nice.",Delphi Hotel
30,"The location is good and this is the second cheapest hotel around this area.So I stayed here several times. I found one hotel cheaper but it was terrible so I think this hotel is a good choice if you dont want spent more money.Small room. and each time I visit they try to make more money knowing I am regular.Very old small room, but clean= caz phillipino mades here are nice and hard working= please tip them if you have chance to visit here.",Delphi Hotel
40,"A nice budget hotel indeed. My room was very, very small but it was en suite with balcony. And the wireless internet worked fine and was fast, something you don't usually expect with Mediterranean budget hotels.The owners and staff are extremely friendly, housekeeping effective and the Delphi has a 24-hour front desk. So why not full five stars?Well, there's a massive building site literally just yards from the hotel. Work starts soon after 6 am so don't expect so sleep later without good earplugs at least. This is not the hotel's fault of course, but at the moment it does seriously affect sleep quality. However, if you don't mind using plugs then it's OK. The only trouble then is to hear your wake up call.The Delphi is at the very center of Nicosia so everything you might need can be found within short walking distance. There's a 24/7 minimarket 50 yards away and for example a lovely sandwich bar open til very late. The sandwich place is run by a Finn (!), ask the locals for Matti and they'll tell you how to find it.The nearest border crossing to Turkish Nicosia is only a five minutes walk away and another one less than a mile away. Crossing the border is a formality at least to EU citizens unless there have been some troubles which are rare. I happened to be in Nicosia during the North Cyprus independence day so there was some hard core political action on the streets. Should you be a bit of an adventure traveler and follow or even join this kind of activity beware that the police can come hard on sectarian marchers and a panic might follow.",Delphi Hotel
