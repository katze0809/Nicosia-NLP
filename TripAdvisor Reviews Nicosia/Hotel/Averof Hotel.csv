40,"Stayed two nights at this hotel.Very much liked the balcony in the room and check in was relatively easy.The hotel is dated but has a certain charm about it.A shop and a few restaurants within 10/15min walking distance.25min walk to local museum and art gallery.Breakfast wasn’t great but the effort was made at least. Paid for by work and I wouldn’t have been happy if I had paid for it.The staff were accommodating but communicating to them wasn’t easy.If you want a short and sweet visit, one or two nights, I’d recommend this hotel. But no longer.",Averof Hotel
40,"I was on a business trip and needed a place near the office. This hotel is in a quiet place with AC and a small balcony. Even it's outdated, the place was very very clean. Loved the architecture of the hotel.",Averof Hotel
10,"We booked a twin room for two nights, but when we got there they said they did not have our room, but would put us in a bigger room. We thought great!!. We were given the key and went upstairs to the room. This was a 5 bed dormatory, with an empty fridge on a table and a pokey bathroom...nothing else.We went downstairs and was told i could have one room and my friend a room on another floor!!! We asked for our money back and went somewhere else.You get what you pay for. If you just need a cheap night or two this is for you. Just do not expect comfort as well.",Averof Hotel
50,"HiI visited Nicosia in Oct for two days and have to say is quite interesting city!! The hotel was excellent value for money just about 15-20 min walk from city centre,so from the bus station to the hotel you can see many interesting things and history about Turkish occupation, then you can pass a lovely palms park then cross the road and you are in really nice quite residential area and couples more streets and you are there;))Is quite easy to find, the blond lady on reception probably owner of the hotel was very nice and polite. The check in was from 2pm and my room was ready for collection ;))Is really nice old hotel is looks like chalet in the mountainI have got a very nice massive big room with six single beds ..I was feeling as in the cartoon Snow white and her seven a little men hahaha....It was a really nice clean room with private bathroom.I had a very good sleep quite comfortable bed and then I had a really nice breakfestwhich was included the price.The breakfest was very nice and tasty, good selection of food, quite enough at the morning;))The housekeeping and breakfest staff was excellent !!! They are very polite and with smile on her face help you if you need. Well done and thank you!!!So if you are looking for a really nice not so expensive hotel in Nicosia I really recomended thi hotel.ευχαριστώ !!!Mario ;))",Averof Hotel
50,"Excellent value for money. Comfortable and friendly hotel, with a kind and professional personnel. It looks like a very stylish old inn. Quiet, clean, bright, cosy. Breakfast was luxurious, you could choose among many kinds of food, including fruit, fruit juice and honey. They must be No.1 in Lefkosia!",Averof Hotel
50,"I stayed at hotel Averov for 3 nights (1-4 February 2018). I was really impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff, the cleanliness of the place and the very good breakfast. The hotel is located at Ayios Andreas suburb of Nicosia, a very quite and green area. It is a 10-15 min wall from Nicosia downtown, very close to government and commercial area.The hotel is decorated in a 70's ""country"" style, a little bit aged but very well preserved and maintained. My room was somehow small for my taste, but still comfortable, with a large closet and bathroom. Wi-Fi available everywhere, a bit slow though. Amenities basic, including shampoo and soap only. However hot water needed a few seconds to come through the tap.I would unconditionally suggest it as a place to stay in Nicosia, especially for professionals who need a quite, budget accommodation for their visit in Nicosia. And, certainly it will be my first choice for accommodation every time I visit Nicosia. Excellent value for money.",Averof Hotel
50,"A lovely place, friendly and cosy. Comfortably located in the centre of town, yet not in the middle of tourist attractions. Average prices and very helpful staff. Better if you have a car to move around.",Averof Hotel
40,"stayed here twice and are due to visit a third time .excellent service friendly staff.,Rooms a bit tired but very clean and comfortable location excellent 10 min walk into centre of Nicosia.Would defitnetly recommend this hotel value for money",Averof Hotel
40,Tradition hotel in a more residential area..continental breakfast was fine ..free tee and coffee at any time..nice private balcony and a sitting area by the main entrance..the staff are welcoming and helpful..the hotel rooms are a bit tired as regards decor...but the price is right so can't really complain...I had to move on due to holiday commitments and went to Rimi hotel in old town Nicosia..this was twice the price and not as good...the booking dot com description on Rimi was totally wrong....booking dot com said they go by the descriptions the hotels give them....averof was accurate and value for money.,Averof Hotel
50,"This was the first time we stayed here.Everything was as we hoped for. The staff were extremely helpful arranging a fridge in our room and serving drinks in their small bar after midnight! It was unusually hot in Nicosia, but our room a/c worked extremely better than expected. Rooms were very clean and breakfast was extensive for a two star hotel.",Averof Hotel
30,We stayed there in mid September so it was quite warm. We like the weather like that so we had no problem with the heat. We loved opening up the windows of an afternoon & there was a lovely breeze. The room was quite big but basic. A fridge would have been nice so we could store some of our food. The b'fast was lovely. If you wanted a drink at night you could get one from the bar downstairs (which is great because town is about a 20min walk away). Very clean & staff were lovely. We would stay here again.,Averof Hotel
20,We spent 3 nights here. This is a kind of traditional hotel. It used to be house I guess. The building is beautiful and the neighbourhood is quiet but all furnitures are is old here.The air condition and the TV didn't work.There was no refrigerator either.They put shampoo and shower gel only once.The hotel manager is a middle aged woman that can help you in any ways but the addresses you need to. The reception is quite polite and helpful unless they don't speak english very well except the young boy.I think this hotel might be good for one night only.We charged for 55€ per night which is way expe,Averof Hotel
40,"The Averof Hotel in Nicosia, Cyprus is the right place for an extended visit - if you need to write, study or do some business in Cyprus' capital. Modest, simple, very quiet and most of all - very warm with an immensely friendly small staff. I stayed there three weeks, needing to be on my own to do some work - and every single request of mine was met and handled. Be sure: this is not a five star hotel, it is no Sheraton or Hilton, nor does it pretend to be one and the prices are set accordingly. Simple and homey and far from the maddening crowd.",Averof Hotel
30,"The location is OK, the hotel looks excellent but someone needs to spend some money on repairs and refurbishments. You open a beautiful door in a clean and well looked after environment to find electrics dangerously not maintained well, wardrobes have been repaired by a Do It Yourself non-enthusiast, bathroom is cleaned but shampoo is not replaced and so on.I loved the people and the service. Breakfast was more than sufficient and varied.They could charge more with a bit of investment. WiFi all around would be good. Fridge in the room with a mini bar and water is also suggested.",Averof Hotel
50,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Averof Hotel. The hotel is located in a quiet leafy residential area only 15 minutes on foot to the Pafos Gate and Cyprus Museum.My room was spotlessly clean and had a lovely balcony.Staff were really helpful and had a range of tourist information brochures, including an excellent map of the city as well as a flyer with a list of free tours offerred by the Tourist Information Office!Breakfast was included in the price and the hotel has parking facilities should you have a car.",Averof Hotel
40,"I spent four nights in this hotel with a small group of students. We needed cheap but reasonably central accommodation in NIcosia - the Averof had it. It is a 15-minute walk into the old town, but Ledra Palace is closer, and if you have a car, they offer free parking and the checkpoint to cross north is less than 10 minutes drive away. Rooms are old but quiet. I am quite allergic to noise but slept with balcony doors open and no ear plugs, Try and get a room to the front with a balcony. Breakfast is adequate (some olives and eggs would be good). Friendly staff. Wifi in communal areas only. They do though block the cost for the entire stay on your credit card, even though the booking site said I would only be charged on arrival. I can't quite see the point of this, and normally only the first night serves as a guarantee - the hotel might as well charge for the stay at the time of booking, then both sides would be clearer about where they stand. That's a minor complaint though. So if you prefer a quiet place over being in the midst of things, and if you don't mind simple and rather old furnishing, this is the place to stay!",Averof Hotel
30,"Let's start from the pro:- slighltly cheaper than the nicosia average- 24h reception- free parking (around 5 places)- comfortable rooms (a bit small but fine for the price)- air conditioningThe cons:- 20 min on foot from the city center- wifi only in the main hall- no safe in the rooms- awful breakfastSo the recommendation is: ok if you don't find anything else better and tou are ready to eat out in the morning.A special note about the breakfast: at 9 they were not refilling the food even if supposed until 10, the personnel (not even saying hello) had no idea how the toast machine was working. Coffee was disgusting and food of poor quality (and always the same), fruit almost rotten. I would have given a general higher rate if they hadn't provided breakfast at all for the same price.",Averof Hotel
50,The hotel is located in a very quiet neighborhood of Nicosia. 5 min to the city center with taxi. It is small but the friendly staff and vintage furnishing makes your stay pleasant. Accommodation is cheap but cosy except in winter time because it's only air condition heating.,Averof Hotel
50,In a very quiet area just a short walk to the city centre. The continental breakfast is filling enough and the hotel is very clean. It is old style but that is what makes it so beautiful. 2nd stay in this hotel and we will be back. Very helpful staff,Averof Hotel
40,"Nice and friendly staff who will help you with almost anything. Adequate breakfast, flexible eating hours. Clean rooms. No toothbrush and few washing material though. The water didn't work properly when I first decided to take a shower, but they fixed it quickly once told and gave me keys to another room in the meantime.",Averof Hotel
40,"We staied (four people) only one night at Averof hotel, 10/15 min on foot from city center; it's very simple but nice and clean. The forniture is typical cypriot. In august is too hot in Nicosia, but our room had the air condition (with fee). The owners are kindly.",Averof Hotel
50,"I was here for 9 days for work.Staff was friendly and helpful...and even washed my clothes for free!!!Breakfast was good, wifi worked only in the comonal area but that is not a problem as it was a large area.Very clean, large room cleaned every day, good value for money.15 min walk from the centre of Nicosia.",Averof Hotel
40,"This hotel is situated in a nice residential area within a 20 minute walk of the centre of the old town. The rooms are basic but clean, comfortable and of a good size. The breakfast is a continental buffet which is adequate. The corridors were a little noisy at night and there were quite a few long term students staying. That said no complains and would stay again.Good location to see the old town. Would say 2 days in Nicosia is enough to see what you need to see.",Averof Hotel
40,"Located in a quiet , verdant and slightly faded aristocratic nicosian neighbourhood , the Averof has balconied rooms with modest, clean amenities. Zoe the receptionist was totally welcoming , delivering a complimentary Cypriot coffee to my room after check in.After exploring the fascinating old quarter, I rang the hotel and they sent a taxi to pick me up and deliver me back to the hotel at night ,as I wandered far. It's these sort of details that make a good impression on a traveller such as myself.There's a charming verandah out front for relaxing ,an indoor lounge with free wifi and a very decent buffet breakfast. I had a very satisfying two night stay at the averof.",Averof Hotel
50,"Great value hotel just a short 20 minute walk to the centre of town. Very friendly and helpful staff. Hotel is an ""old style"" Cypriot hotel with up to date facilities in a quiet residential area . Rooms are clean and have character. Basic but tasty continental breakfast. Much better than over-priced city centre hotels.",Averof Hotel
40,We moved from Italy to stay in Cyprus. As a family (two adults and two children aged 10 and 8) we had to find an accomodation in order to prepare our new house in Zigy. The children are going to school in Nicosia. So we booked for this hotel on internet. We had a nice two rooms accomodation with bathroom. Good breakfast. But what we appreciated most was the many good suggestions we had in order to find shops and all what you need when moving to a new place. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi and this is one of the best facilities today!,Averof Hotel
30,"As a part of a group of students studying abroad, I stayed at Averof Hotel for about two weeks. The rooms are small and simple, and about a 25 minute walk from downtown (or a quick, cheap cab ride). The room decor isn't the brightest or newest and the shower water temps were random sometimes, but other perks made up for this (plus the awesome new manager shared her plans for upgrading the space soon). The balconies overlooking a safe and quiet neighborhood street, a lovely living room area downstairs, small bar, and simple but good breakfast were positives of the facility. The best part of the stay was the solid customer service we were treated to by very friendly staff. We were happy to call Averof Hotel home for this time!",Averof Hotel
40,"We (a study tour of 15 graduate students from the US) are finishing up a 2 week stay at Averof. In all of my travels abroad, I have never stayed at a place where there is such amazing hospitality, friendliness and kindness. They continuously go above and beyond daily to make each and every one of our stay's enjoyable and extra special. The rooms are simple but comfortable. The breakfast while basic, was delicious. The location I found great as it is a nice walk (25 minutes) to the downtown area and is quiet.I would definitely stay here again.",Averof Hotel
20,"Not very central location, and a bit expensive comparing to the other Cyprus hotels (seaside hotels I mean). Free internet at the reception hall. Free parking. Breakfast is poor even if compared with continental standards.",Averof Hotel
30,We stayed 2 days. it was okay. not that great though. One thing i should really appreciate is the service. everything else was just average.,Averof Hotel
30,"We were in Cyprus on a surveying trip, so this was a good base for us.It's a simple place to stay with no frills (except free internet, which was great to have), which is more or less what we expected for the price we paid.To all the people complaining about breakfast - if you want a uniformed chef preparing you a fresh omlet or frying waffles, you're going to have to pay a bit more than when these guys are charging.",Averof Hotel
10,"Booked for location and family run Cypriot friendly hotel. NOPE. Miserable, terrible hotel damp and very unfriendly building and people. Uncomfortable bed didnt sleep a wink and no hot water. Planned a two day trip one night over in Nicoisa as staying in Polis to explore the city. This ruined our trip we could not wait to check out, parking up for the second day and used the car rather than the room!Dont bothers its not cheap and the breakfast was laughable margarine, bread and 1 glass of awful orange juice. Never met such unhospitable Cypriots as in this hotel.",Averof Hotel
50,"I have actually stayed at Averof Hotel a few times. I love staying there as the staff are really friendly and super helpful . They make you feel like you are one of the family always offering advice on quality places to dine and great sights to see. The rooms are always kept clean with all the usual fresh sheets and air con etc. The beds are comfortable and a good nights sleep is always ensured. No night time noise, very peaceful indeed. The prices are also very reasonable. Good food and a great bar! I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I have had friends stay there in the past and they have never been disappointed.",Averof Hotel
50,I booked a two night stay for myself and 5 other colleagues during a business trip to Cyprus and feel a sense of satisfaction from the warmth of our welcome to the value for money we got. The hotel remains very basic and may look dated but it was clean and more importantly quiet enough to allow us to relax and work in between various meetings. Although it is tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood it felt that the hotel was never far from anywhere.It helped having clear and concise English speakers who understood and happily looked after any request we had which is something I have struggled to find in other more lavish hotels. A sense of a family atmosphere was very appealing and would lead me to recommend the hotel onwards as I definitely plan to stay there again.,Averof Hotel
40,"Lovely staying, enjoyed it very much! The hotel is situated in the quiet region of Ayios Andreas but it is only 15min walk from the city center! It is clean and very traditional with quite big rooms! The staff is very very hospital and friendly.",Averof Hotel
20,"I stayed at the Averof Hotel with my father during my visit in Nicosia for research purposes. The hotel is overall bad, even for the comparatively low amount of money paid. Hotel is old, incredibly tacky decorated (the web site claims that to be'traditional' decoration, but this is just an excuse for a tasteless decoration). Breakfast is bad, with very limited variety (i never understand what kind of coffee was the one available at the 'buffet' comprising by two tables). The Hotel has two floors but NO LIFT (without any relevant warning in the website) so is not recommended to anyone with mobility problems. Rooms were fairly spacious with balconies. TV broken, AIR-CON ADDITIONALLY CHARGED (5 euros per day), towels provided only for the one of us and we had to ask for more, they were never changed within 4 days (neither the bed set), generally, CLEANLINESS IS A BIG PROBLEM as the hotel is dirty throughout and there is a constant feeling of dust covering everything, from reception to bath tubes. Staff is ok. Location is very peaceful which is nice but is not as close to the city centre as someone can assume reading the rest of the reviews.",Averof Hotel
10,"i reserved from month before and they took from my credit card money for confirm my reservation when i arrived to the hotel with my family at midnight.the employee he didnt know nothing about my reservation he makes a calling for all staff how work in averof hotel no 1 know about my reserve ,imagine my situation and they dont understand nothing only money i paid for nothing ,i met a horrible experience in this hotel they treat u with hummer if u want your right.",Averof Hotel
40,"I liked this friendly family run hotel, which is located in a nice quiet part of Nicosia (a city that can be very noisy). I was the only guest in the place, which is a slightly odd experience, but my room was clean and comfortable, and surprisingly large, although it was very basic.If you cannot live without satellite TV or mini-bars or room service then small hotels like this will never satisfy you. If, on the other hand, you just was a clean, simple room and your own bathroom that is also clean, then the Averof is nice enough and costs a lot less than most Nicosia hotels.As I was attending an education recruitment fair outside of the city centre the location was not so much of an issue for me, but the walk into the town centre was not too far and very pleasant at night. You walk alongside the Green Line and past the archaeological museum. The distance might be a bit much in the heat of the summer, but there are always taxis.",Averof Hotel
10,"This hotel was the worst ""hotel"" ever imaginable and I am surprised they are still in business. There was no water to take a shower and the place was filthy. I would recommend going to Classic Hotel or the Cleopatra. Don't waste your money on this hotel (which is very shady).",Averof Hotel
40,"A friend and I stayed at the Averof Hotel for one night following a friend's wedding in Cyprus. The rooms are basic but clean, and good value for the price. Eliza, the receptionist at the hotel, was extremely helpful and polite. You can walk into the centre of town in 20 minutes, or a catch a bus. Probably best to pay the extra (around £3.50 Sterling per night) for air conditioning, as Cyprus is extremely hot most of the time.",Averof Hotel
