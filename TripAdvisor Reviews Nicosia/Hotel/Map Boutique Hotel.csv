The gym was very well equipped (one of the best Hotel gyms I’ve seen) If you have an option I’d suggest a room higher up so you are away from the street noise.",Map Boutique Hotel

The location is perfect (very close to the city centre), the hotel in new and clean but, for me the very best of this expereince was the hotel staff: always super kind, flexible and eager to support at any time of the day/night! I reccomend it!",Map Boutique Hotel
50,"We stayed at this hotel for a few days for my fiancés 30th birthday. While we were impressed with the room and overall amenities, what made our stay truly special was how staff went above and beyond to make it a memorable experience! They helped me plan a great birthday surprise in the room including balloons and a bottle of wine. Additionally, our hostess at breakfast always remembered our order by heart and converted us into full time freddo fans (iced coffee popular among Cypriots). Thanks again for your hospitality!",Map Boutique Hotel

40,"Very modern, new and minimalistic in style.Good size rooms; excellent WiFi and one of the best air conditioning I have seen.Gym and breakfast good/fair.Room a bit noisy as facing busy ring road.No water at reception nor in the room (all other hotels in cyprus offer that !)First in five hotels on same trip asking my wife also for her private mobile number and email address (in addition to passport which normal).Entrance door was always locked which gave strange feeling.Although very modern not a single parking space for clients not even for drop on/off ????You had to use big dusty construction side for parking next door - but not even any agreement with hotel ( very lousy )Staff quite stiff and somewhat unwelcoming or indifferent with exception of Brazilian Girl at breakfast.Very modern but at the end this would be a nice stylish new three star city hotel in European countries - but alternatives in Nicosia are only very few - so that is fair/good",Map Boutique Hotel
