30,"A few notes...There is no bar in the casino to just sit have a drink, relax and have a snack which I found odd.You cannot get an iron or ironing board in the room and there is no ironing room so you have to use their service.Phone in the bedroom didn’t work.The sun went behind the hotel at about 3pm so sunbathing all day isn’t possible.Food is just okay.Not all staff speak good English.We upgraded to a larger room and stayed in 301. I would not recommend doing that for the extra price.Positives were. Hotel was clean and tidy though. The staff that did speak English were pleased rand helpful. Pool area was fresh, modern and clean.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,The place has been renovated into a really nice casino. Staff is very friendly and do their upmost to make you feel welcome.Only downside i would say is that it needs a bit more light at the live games. The playing cards are the casino's own brand and with the bad lighting sometimes it is hard to read your cards.,Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"Customer service was excellent - front desk staff could help with all kinds of questions and info. Located on a busy shopping street, many walkable restaurants and cafes. Clean room with many amenities in both the room and overall hotel. However, room was supposedly non smoking but still had that smell... It could use some touch ups and repairs (cigarette burns on furniture, carpet spots) but was overall comfortable and in good condition. Breakfast provided a lot of tasty options but was not outstanding. We used the well-equipped gym and got massages in the spa - enjoyed both. Overall high quality place, one of the nicest hotels in north Nicosia, but still reasonably priced.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
10,"DO NOT visit this hotel if you look or are Chinese or Russian.I stayed at this hotel for business.I had a few hours to myself, so I decided to visit the casino.I sat down at one of the Blackjack tables and one of the employees asked for my name,so I gave him my “Pasha casino card”.He returned my card with the announcement: “You're not allowed to play at the Blackjack table”I asked him what the reason is to refuse me, he said again: “You are not allowed to play Blackjack”Another employee (maybe a floor manager?) also came to me and he confirmed that I was not allowed to play at the Blackjack table, but only on the machines or roulette table.So I asked this man again, which casino rules are refusing me to play Blackjack here.He answered: “Russians and Chinese are not allowed to play Blackjack here”So I showed him my Dutch National ID card, proving to him and his colleagues that I’m not Chinese, but a Dutch citizen!Again I asked them, why I’m not allowed to play here because I just proved to him I’m a Dutch citizen. One of his colleagues then said, because I look Chinese and the “floor manager” still refused me at the table.Then I asked him: “You are refusing me play here because I look Chinese, so this is racism and discrimination”Your so-called “manager” couldn’t properly deny my accusation.In short:- I'm not being refused on grounds of being aggressive, disrespectful, rude or disturbing to anybody- I'm being refused only based on my looks, not my nationality. This is pure racism and discrimination.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
30,"This is a lovely hotel very friendly staff I would recommend it but, there is a but, there is no iron or ironing board in the rooms, so if your in a hurry to go out your screwed,there have a person who comes to your room and take your ironing away and ofcourse there is a charge,I don't like strangers ironing my clothes for me, this ridiculous put irons in the room so people can iron there own clothes, so because I needed my clothes iron at different times and I didn't know in advance, I had to go out with clothes wrinkled.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"I enjoyed the rich Mediterranean cuisine and the friendly and hospitable staff at the hotel. The room was well swept and I enjoyed my time at the pool. There was warm water. The hotel also provided transport to places I liked. The hotel is located near some great shops and is next to town, The lunch and breakfast is good and so is the supper",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
30,"Furnitures are very old. Fridge is not cool enough and loud. Hot air comes out from the fridge, that we were not able to sit at the desk and work. Price is too expensive. Pool was small and the roof on top was closed even a sunny weather outside. Far away from the center.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
30,"This Hotel is always difficult to rate. This is my 4th visit to this hotel, simply because of where it is situated. My first stay was Fantastic, but I have come to realize it was fantastic not because of the facilities , but because of the staff. This trip has proven to be more disappointing. Reception is very helpful and friendly , especially the women during the day. However the waitering staff throughout the rest of the hotel leave much to be desired. Most don’t speak English, and are unapproachable, especially if you are female. You are easily passed over for any kind of service. There is one waiter, Mehmet who really went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. Thank you. The breakfast buffet, was minimal and tasteless. While we had a fantastically spacious room, the aircon was a problem. Overall a very uneventful experience",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
10,"It's 10:40 on a Saturday night. I'd prefer to be sleeping rather than writing this stupid review, but I can't sleep because—although I'm on the seventh floor, requested a quiet room, and have called the front desk twice—the driving, thumping, crappy music from ""the club"" sounds like someone is slamming the door repeatedly from the neighboring room. The hardware in my bathroom is actually rattling.Is it really necessary to play the ""music"" at 140 decibels? Could the people in the club be just as happy at, say, 120 decibels? Clearly this hotel does not care about its individual guests who have paid them for sleep.Also, drop the attitude at the front desk at check-in.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"My husband and I stayed at Golden Tulip Hotel for leisure during Jan/Feb 2018 for 10 nights and was delivered with top, quality service by all the staff and tasted the most delicious and tasty meals we've ever had from the hotel's restaurant. The buffet breakfast was massive with a huge variety of different foods to try daily. Our room was cleaned daily and was always immaculate every afternoon we would return from a long day of sightseeing. The hotel is great value for money, offers a quiet; relaxing comfort zone and would not hesitate in recommending anyone stay at this hotel.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,"I stayed here for 2 nights and it was fine although the breakfast was not up to 5 star standard. There was no cereals of any great worth, although the nut and fruit selection and the variety of cheese was very good. Service was good but the restaurant lacked atmosphere. The bedroom was good and the bed an excellent size. The shower was OK although it was over the bath which I don't like. Toiletries were very good especially the comb which is an unusual feature.I didn't eat in the restaurant for either lunch or dinner so can't comment on this aspect. The indoor swimming pool looked great although I didn't use it. The business centre consisted of 2 computers and was good though the keyboards are in Turkish format and required some translation. Reception and housekeeping staff were good. There is a large casino which was very busy with a variety of games being played.Overall this was a good hotel and I would stay hete again.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"Best hotel in Nicosia? Well haven’t been to the Marriot yet, but this is wonderful: huge rooms, huge bed, chaise lounge, panoramic windows with mountain views, large clean bathrooms and very helpful staff. I was on a business trip and had to work in the room a lot: very comfortable desk space, although I did have to move the kettle and plug it in by the bed, so I could plug in my computer and make a cup of tea at the same time ;)The pool area is really quiet and absolutely beautiful. Breakfast was ok. Had better in places like this, but all the basics were there, although their cereal selection is a bit stingy.I used the business centre: two computers, a printer and a fax. This was perfectly serviceable and free, so no complaints other than the Turkish language operating system and keyboards.Tip: if you are looking for the @ mark, Pres the right hand ‘alt gr’ button at the same time as the Q key…yeah…not at all obvious. I did suggest to them that they print up a help sheet for English language computer users and they said they would so we shall see in future reviews…The only major issue here is the very slow wifi. It works, but you really have to wait for it to work! You need an upgrade guys.Having said that, I loved my time in this hotel. Great location, great rooms, great staff, oh and a really comfortable bed that could have slept six!",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"It's one of the beautiful and nice hotel that I saw, big room, good location, clean, helpful staff, good breakfast , but a little bit expensive, they helped us for a nice day tour with hotel taxi with valuable price",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,"My husband and I stayed 10 nights for business and pleasure. The Hotel was a perfect location for us and is on the main road of shops and restaurants, even a cinema only 10 minutes walk away.The hotel room was comfortable, roomy and very clean. Fresh towels and toiletries daily with complimentary water. Our only complaint was that the mini bar was never replenished after we had used some items.Breakfast included was lovely with a wide choice and all of the waiting staff were very friendly. We ate in the poolside restaurant on a couple of nights which was very nice and relaxing. When we ordered room service the quality of food was just as nice as the restaurant with a speedy service.We enjoyed a couple of evenings at the casino where we spent a few hours and also enjoyed the really nice buffet restaurant available to players.The outside pool was lovely, relaxing and quiet, and although we didn't use the spa facilities they looked very nice. My husband used the gym and was impressed.This hotel has to be one of the best in Nicosia and I would definately recommend staying here.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"Everything was perfect. Food, staff, room spaciaous and breakfast although it can be improved but its good. Its located near some shops and not far away from the downtown, around 20 min walk. Definitely going to stay in it next time.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"Very good hotel. Very nice staff and excellent breakfast. The pool is magnificent (25 metres, so good for swimmers). Also a good spa. Conveniently located on Dereboyu street, packed with shops and restaurants.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,"Comfortable hotel, had a delicious meal in the restaurant at low cost, nice pool, good gym, friendly service. (Note that the hotel is on the Turkish Cyprus side of Nicosia so you need your passport and to cross the border to get there). Casino on ground floor for those that like that sort of thing. I walked round it, it was heavily 'policed' by security team who seemed a bit nervous for some reason. I had to pass through a metal detector to get in but I guess these are the times we are living in.Great views from higher floors especially of the mountains.Minor quibble is its location is a few kilometres from the old town, too far to walk in the heat and not many taxis were to be found easily to get me to the hotel.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,The hotel is quite clean and comfortable. Staff is very friendly and it is in a central location. Open buffet breakfast is superb with huge variety and food in restaurant is delicious. Highly recomended. Surely will come back.,Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"The staff are welcoming, always smiling. I really enjoyed my stay, everything was super clean, I liked the Turkish breakfast as well.The room was so comfort, the bathroom was clean. I loved the Gym, Spa, Sauna and the Turkish bath after a long walk in the city!",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,The outside looks great. The lobby is very attractive with marble and great decor. There is a bar downstairs. There is also a 30 car car park out front to park your car but there is a taxi rank near by. Staff are very helpful and kind and all speak very good English. I had my own room from my parents. It was spacious with a double bed and a good view of the town from the window.Breakfast was good next to the indoor pool. I had pancakes most days but it was a typical Turkish hotel breakfast. Waiters were on hand to take drink orders and any special meals. The evening food was also great with lots of fish and other meat and vegetarian dishes on the menu. Prices were not too expensive and my parents drank good wine for a cheap cost. The spa was good with massages provided for extra charge. The pool was very big and altough indoor the roof comes off above it in summer. I went in April for a week and it was closed. The hotel was in a good location in town and near a migros. You could walk to the high street or any restaurants. It was expensive as it is five star.Overall a very good stay and if I go back to Nicosia I would stay there again.,Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

Also after a second time in herd, the result was the same. b) In the resepsiyon area is a cafe, but nobody asks you if you want order something. c) On Check out the concierge asked me if I had something from the minibar. Although I denied, she asked the floor manager to check. I am sorry but I expect more from a 5* Hotel.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"Excellent hotel and helpful dinning staff. My only concern was the lack of fluent English speaking staff members. Also the front of hotel staff receiving guests were selective of who they would render their service, e.g. when you arrive with a taxi some would have doors open for them, but for me never happened. There is room of improvement needed in the area of customer service and less discrimination due to skin colour.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
10,"This ""5 stars"" hotel has only nice and large room but they have a very big management problems about this facility. Front desk not welcomes you, also very slow and lack of taste breakfast and the unproffesional waiters and a la carte restaurant too. Everbody is very slow and rude to the guests. It is not a cheap hotel in Cyprus standards but they are acting to the customer like they paid nothing. When you turn on the AC cigarette smell fills the room, and food smell in the morning comes from there even if you stays 8th floor. Wi-fi is weak at the room. I am not going to make this mistake again when I ll go to Cyprus.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

Been thinking wisely before booking this hotel but then i had no regret at all! From check-in till check-out, we had one of best services ever showed by hotel staff. Especially manager Mr. Ufuk did everything for us to feel home over there so, we definetely felt this way! There is only one address for me in Nicosia now; Golden Tulip! Thank you so much for a wonderful service, beautiful dishes and smiling faces...",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

40,"We stayed a night for an event and found the hotel most comfortable and the service very acceptable.The rooms are very clean and with nice toilets and all basic amenities.We did not eat but checked the menu and found the prices very reasonable, only suggestion to have more local cuisine and not just international dishes.Service at the poolside event was a bit amateur but I believe they use trainees for such events which is normal.Breakfast was outstanding and the highlight of the stay.Would definitely stay here again when needed.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
20,"I've been staying in the Merit Hotel up the road for nearly two months because my company has a special rate - I would be staying here otherwise as it's the nicest hotel in Lefkosa. That said, I do come to the Golden Tulip 5/6 times a week to eat because the food is excellent and the service is exceptional.Today I had the misfortune of encountering the owner of the franchise shouting at his staff and banging his hands on the table when unhappy with some aspect of his food. This is by far the worst experience I've had in a restaurant in Cyprus and I was shocked to hear he owns the hotel.Upon leaving he was sitting at reception so I approached him to politely share my experience of his hotel, the food and the staff, he grunted at me, waved me away without speaking to me and told me to speak to the desk staff. I explained it was his attitude I wanted to discuss and he once again refused to talk to me, so I did explain to the front desk staff and as I left he shouted at them to ask what I wanted!The staff here do a fantastic job of looking after guests and diners and they get paid a pittance for doing so (500 euros a month in some cases) - they shouldn't be spoken to in the way I witnessed and it is a poor reflection of the Golden Tulip brand that they let people like this take the helm.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
20,"I've been coming to the hotel restaurant for several months because the food is excellent, the staff is very friendly, and the prices are very economical. Today, however, I have had the poorest experience yet, and it had nothing to do with the aforementioned positives.A man appeared to be very upset with something, and started berating the staff loudly, throwing a temper tantrum with his (apparent) very young daughter at the table. My colleague and I were tempted to go over and step in to calm the irate man down, but decided to eat our food instead.After we finished our lunch, and when leaving through the lobby, we saw the man sitting at a desk by the front counter. We approached him to talk to him, but he apparently did not speak English. We spoke to the counter staff instead, who informed us that he was the owner of the hotel. This made his actions previously even more deplorable in our eyes, as it appears he was actually berating his staff for some perceived slight.While he is of course entitled to deliver feedback to his employees regarding mistakes made, or procedures not followed, to do so in such an aggressive, loud, obnoxious, and unprofessional manner in public, in front of paying customers does not add much to his credibility as a manager. I would suggest that any future potential customers avoid upper management as much as possible, as we have never had any problem with the frontline staff. If this review is ever brought to the attention of the owners, I say, put a sock in it, and treat your staff with respect, and they will do the same for you.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Golden Tulip. The staff were very helpful and service was excellent. The room style is a bit outdated, but they are spacious and clean which matters most. The breakfast has a great variety for all tastes. The pool is a fantastic escape from the summer heat and the Spa facilities are certainly of the best I've seen yet. Will gladly return!",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"We stayed at the Golden Tulip in Lefkosa/Nicosia for a week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was attentive and spoke English. The restaurant had a wide variety of tasty dishes and the prices were very reasonable. Breakfast was a great way to start our days. Taxis were always available and the front desk would call for a dolmus if we were feeling adventurous. Overall, highly recommended.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,"The Golden Tulip has everything required by the short-stay guest. A fairly central location, parking and pick-up point, business centre, pool, gym and good restaurant. The rooms are comfortable with good internet connections, and the staff are all English-speaking, helpful and friendly. Check-in and check-out are quick and simple. Breakfasts are more than adequate, though service may be a bit slow early in the morning. Slightly disappointing to find only two English TV channels, but no real complaints after five or six stays. Just a five minute drive to the border should you have business in the South. The atmosphere changes late in the evening when customers arrive at the casino, popular with visitors from the south and from Turkey, but there is no disturbance. Recommended for stays of up to four or five days.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,The Golden Tulip Nicosia (on the Turkish side) is a great place as a starting point to discover both sides of Nicosia. It is 5 min. drive from the border line which you can easily cross with a car. The rooms are fantastic and big and the service is very good. The breakfast buffet is extensive and complete.,Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"Stayed there for 4 nights. Very helpful staff, clean rooms. The restaurant was excellent, new menu for dinner and for lunch, couldn't choose anything I didn't like. The pool in the restaurant gave a very cool feeling, possibly because I have never seen anything like this before. It is a very central location in the Turkish side of Nicosia so if you are a business traveller choose this place.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

30,"I stayed one night at this hotel.The pros: I must say, the hotel is in a great location! The room was large, and the bathroom was clean and updated. This hotel stocked Molton Brown products, which I LOVE!The cons: the carpet in the hallways and in the room are looking shabby, and the bed was flimsy and concave. *ICK!* My room was on the fourth floor, and I couldn't keep the air conditioning on because it was noisy and blew smoky air into the room. *COUGH* *WHEEZE* Thus, the room was hot and stuffy, and smelled of stale smoke.I took a walk around the hotel, and the pool was closed because it is being renovated. It looks like it will be really nice when reopen. The fitness area looked decent, and breakfast was good, but the server treated me like I wasn't good enough to belong there.Overall, because of the room, the lack of amenities (which I wasn't told about in advance) and the level of service, I felt that the price wasn't worth the money. I wouldn't choose to stay here again.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"The room are spacious, clean and with a lot of light. The windows are not opening, which is a big problem because fresh air is lacking. Amazing breakfast and dinner. Very nice casino!

50,"I stayed here for a week while I was competing in a pageant. We spent most of our time in the hotel apart from a few guided tours in nearby towns. The hotel was very nice, the rooms quite spacious and very clean. The pool is lovely although deck chairs are somewhat limited. We stayed on full board for the week. Breakfast was a good buffet with a normal selection for english/continental breakfast. Lunch and dinner were typical Turkish dishes, which were quite delicious. The staff were friendly and helpful and overall it was a very nice stay. We didnt spend much time in the casino but when we went we had a good time. The immediate surroundings don't seem to have much in the way of sightseeing, but a short drive away to nearby towns provides some really nice sights. Definitely recommend!",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,"The room was very clean and spacious, breakfast excellent, the staff friendly and handled two minor problems that we had very professionally. I definitely recommend this hotel for a business trip in Lefkosa. The only critism i would make is that the window could not be opened so the room lacked clean air.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

40,"Very good hotel. Not much to complain about. Very comfortable room, good aircon. The breakfast is the best buffet I have ever seen in a Hotel, so much to chose from, you could fill up for the day.

I was treated with a lot of respect and attention. Staff did everything possible to make my stay very comfortable.The room was very clean and the food was very fresh.Since I was checking out early in the morning in order to catch a flight at 07.00hrs, they offered to pack some light snack for me as breakfast - I found this quite interesting and i was delighted.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

20,"The hotel is getting worse every other day. my first 3 stays were great. Then ""good"" then ""not bad"" and now ""never again""!!! Some of the old personnel seemed to have left...Stayed for 3 days and the pool was under construction almost for half a day in the middle of summer. The noise was so bad that we could not even stay to sunbathe. And no sign of apology for inconvenience . Our room was entered into although we had a no disturb sign. The cheese they served at breakfast was stale but they pretended as if it was some exclusive french cheese and that the bad smell was ordinary.After all we wrote a complaint letter directly to both the room supervisor and the general manager but they did not bother to reply its been 1 month...The only good thing is that their casino is still invincible in cyprus. But next time i will stay elsewhere and just go there for the casino.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

10,"After travelling from Pafos and booking the Hilton Cyprus so we could have a casino night we were very let down with the Golden Tulip. The casino was helpful enough to send a car to pick us up which was very kind of them.However upon entering the casino, no ID was taken and we were shown in. (Not a problem as I was dreading filling in the usual forms, just a bit unusual) Anyway the entrance opens into the middle of the floor and you are immediately greeted by what is a nice looking casino with some unique features.In my party was myself my brother and some attractive women, clearly the casinos are not normally utilised by tourists as the turkish patrons made it obvious they were not happy to see us here. The girls were leered at in a very seedy and degrading way and felt very uncomfortable, one man followed them to a table and just stood there leering at them for 5 minutes before heading back to his seat. The casino was also filled with smoke and it wasnt long before my eyes were watering.The chips are controlled very strictly here. I had lost my wallet and my brother gave me a loan of a couple hundred euros, upon going to the cashier desk to change this into cash I was subjected to an almost police style investigation into where I got these chips and my brother was contacted to ensure he did infact give them to me.I then went to the slot machines and started playing, quite a good variety of machines here and I found one I liked and got comfortable, the drinks are free of charge aslong as your at a table and I ordered Jack Daniels and diet coke. I can 100% assure you that what I was drinking was not Jack Daniels and Cola, it was drinkable but very bitter and after a few glasses of this apparent Jack Daniels I felt completely plastered.The girls arent into gambling and just wanted to sit and have a few cocktails, they went to the seated area and asked for some drinks and were advised they could not serve them drinks and asked them to leave the seated area. The girls came across to us and told us they couldnt get drink, I asked the manager if the girls could have drinks and he told us rather unhospitably ""not unless they are playing"". I informed him only me and my brother are here to gamble and could we please have drinks for the girls and we were willing to pay for him, he still refused.At this point I had had enough, I set the girls up on a machine, put 10 euros in each and told them to spin the minimum bet every 3/4 minutes and just have a news and ensure the waiters bring drinks. This went on for another 20 minutes before the stinging of the eyes, choking of the throught, terrible customer service and feeling out of place got to me and we decided to indulge in the free food and leave.Upon leaving we asked for a return car home, turns out they check to see if you have lost enough money before providing a car, a calculator was brought out and a conversation held with a manager before they agreed to provide a return car back to the hotel.Overall this is a nicely decorated casino with a variety of games, however the knock-off drinks, thug like management, smoke filled environment and seedy turkish men who don't know how to act around attractive women just make this place a horrible night out.I would advise any tourist to avoid this place at all costs, theres nothing at all enjoyable about going to this casino.The casino kindly offered to",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
50,This is a real 4 stars hotel with all the comfort and amenities one desires and expects. The balance between quality/price is unbeatable. Definitely THE place to stay in Lefkosa.,Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino

20,"The hotel is on the Turkish side of the island (Lefkosa). The Turkish side is still divided by a boarder post and is quite less developed than Cyprus. Crossing the boarder with a taxi is very difficult since most taxi drivers won't be allowed to enter Nicosia with their taxis. So you're dropped at the border and there it's ""help yourself"" (e.g. ask police to call a taxi which they'll eventually actually do).If you don't speak Turkish it can be a trip into the unknown. Most at the reception speak decent English. Every other area though (and that includes Room Service Telephone, Security and Waiters) hardly speak any English. The most annoying rule is that they don't allow you to enter a bottle of water or any food into the hotel (if security catches it's confiscated). This includes some sweets as well. So when you pass the metal detector and have something in your pocket it's like smuggling...Feels more like a paid prison than a self proclaimed 5 star hotel.. To be fair their hotel food is decently priced and good (so is the breakfast). But if you stay a while you might get sick of their limited food options. Since the hotel is a bit in the outskirts a decent restaurant is a 10min walk beside waste bins, broken pavements etc.The rooms are clean and decent size. TV program is apart from CNN only Turkish. Very strange again considering the wealth of English TV channels you get at any given 3 or 4 star hotel on the Cyprus side.The Hotel has a Casino inside which attracts some shady guests (some of the women look professional..haven't seen any of their bags screened...).The internet speed is decent and Internet is free. The wireless reception is depending on your room location though (in ours it vanishes often - a cable helps).Cleaning clothes took 2 days and a inquiry call (which had to be translated first) before it got delivered..Overall the people are actually very friendly and try their best - obviously within their limits. Seems they believe their market is Turkey and that's what they cater to (although I believe you get better 5 star's in Turkey with more relaxed rules).I'm putting the overall rating to only 2 since I hope that someone from Golden Tulip management actually reads this. The customer is not king here.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,"stayed in this hotel about 5 or 6 times as the rooms are very nice and comfortable, features a very nice gym and sauna and a superb casino, but the check in was a hassle all the time. The staff is not well trained and they cannot find your online reservations.This happened to us in the first three times in a row, so we decided to call them before the check in to give them ample time to find our reservations so that we wouldn't keep waiting there for ages.Also, some rooms have very small windows and given that the windows cannot be opened, it gives you a claustrophobic feeling so we asked for rooms with large windows (corner rooms) but they always failed to provide us one.So instead of the check in staff learning the room numbers with large windows, we learned them and emailed them saying we want exactly this room or that room! Anyway, we used to put up with all that check in hassle as the hotel is very central and clean and well designed.But the last time was a total turn off for me: While I was in the shower, I opened my eyes and came face to face with 5 people (and one of them turns out to be the general manager) who then turned away giggling. Apparently they came in to fix the mirror! After that I received no apologies but a cup of sliced pineapple only!!! I left the hotel after our planned stay and I sure will never return! Oh, I also stayed there in April (like the previous reviewers) and the pool was closed although it was already summer in Cyprus (all other hotels had opened their pools by the start of April) and the website gave no warning,! Well, of course, noone apologized for that, either!!!",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
30,"this is a new hotel but is not acceptable that you can't open the window. i am allergic to air conditioning and I suffered too much due the presence of moquette in the bed room. staff is not well trained both in english and quality of service. swimmingpool is not working even if they sell as it it. I moved without any regrets. Prices are more expensive than in Europe. Rack price is 200 euro per night, but you can get a single for euro 60,00 per night. breakfast is ok.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
40,"I stayed at the Golden Tulip for one night recently on a buisness trip. The hotel is very new, maybe 6 months or so and it is lovely. Grand lobby and beautiful bedrooms, the room is a good size with a huge, very comfortable bed and bedding. There is everything you need for a comfortable stay and more with a well equipped gym, spa and a fabulous outdoor pool, which sadly was not open when I was there in late April but will be in a week. Breakfast was nice with plenty of choice.",Golden Tulip Nicosia Hotel and Casino
