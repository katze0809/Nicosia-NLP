50,We had a conference and training of tourist guides from all over the world for 2 weeks. The training center all the previous years has worked with this hotel but this year I was in charge of many things and had first hand experience. with this hotel. The manager Sophia went out of her way to accommodate every one's food preference and general requests. Rooms were clean and Paris the cook was excellent preparing lunches for us.Rooms had all the essential needed and if there was a problem Sophia handle it very profesionatelly.,Crown Inn Hotel
20,"The location is very good and it is relatively quiet (if the people next door are quiet - if not you hear them louder then a car passing by). The Stuff is very very friendly and helpful but the rooms leave a lot to be desired. I changed room because it was damp and stuffy and I saw a cochrache. The next one was a ""suite"", larger at the first sight it seemed cleaner but when a entered the bath at night there were more than one cochraches running around. Would not go there again.",Crown Inn Hotel
10,"Hotel is well located for reaching the tourist district. Otherwise dreadful.I recently booked to stay at the Crown Inn Hotel in Nicosia with my husband, adult children & grandchildren. On our arrival to the rooms we were not at all happy with the cleanliness of our rooms - beds had hair on the pillows & one bed had dirty bedsheets, the floors were not vacuumed nor mopped & the hallways were also dirty. We demanded & received a full refund & went elsewhere. No apology for the state of the rooms & no offer to clean them. We booked this hotel based on its location & the glowing reviews on all travel sites however the state of cleanliness needs to be brought to the attention of other travellers!!!",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"Reliability has been the fist impression I had since reservation; the hotel is clean and in a silent location far from traffic noise; style is a little bit old fashioned but not annoying for this. rooms are clean, staff is nice and breakfast has enough choice to satisfy different needs. Small parking is a convenient added value. Fares are quite affordable. Hotel is very near to Northern Cyprus border if you drive by car, 5 mins drive abnd you are at the custon for formalities.",Crown Inn Hotel
30,Older hotel with dated decor. The Rooms were small but clean. No charm but adequate.. the restaurant only had a very limited choice and there were no other restaurants very close. Very hard to find in the one way streets of Nicosia. Buffet breakfast was ok. Good parking. The staff were helpful and pleasant.,Crown Inn Hotel
30,This was my third time here and it’s gone down hill. Grubby around the edges even though they have painted the rooms new mattress but very thin problem getting second pillow sockets hanging off ceiling rose hanging down broken shower 2x toasters but not working food poor and not cheap any more shame as it was good and could be again,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"This hotel is located in a quiet neighbouhood, not far from the city center. There are several good restaurants withing walking distance. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious, but bathrooms may be a bit too small. Breakfast could be more varied, but it was enough for me.",Crown Inn Hotel
30,"A really decent price for one night and brekkie, but that is also reflected in the experience. Our first room was a twin, which felt claustrophobic n dated. Our second room was a double which was much better. The hotel in general is dated. However, the service, managers and owner, were all lovely and really keen to be accomodating, even when there was a booking mistake on my part. We didnt eat breakfast here, so i cant comment on the quality of that aspect",Crown Inn Hotel
20,"The worst bed I have ever slept on, you could literally feel the springs. Trying to get a drink was ridiculous, no wine, no tonic, no soda. Breakfast wasn't edible. Needless to say we will not be going back there. On a positive note the staff were very friendly.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"Staff went out of there way to help make my stay good as my wife was in the general. The room was clean bedding good and loads of hot water, hotel parking was a plus. I was surprised at the rate. Thanks for for such a good stay.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,Very clean. Price is great for what you get. Harry and Svitlana the hosts are very welcoming and make you feel like nothing you ask for is too big. The beds are comfortable. Tv working great. Breakfast ample,Crown Inn Hotel
20,A really ugly hotel. Small bathroom. Small bed. Dirty walls. Reception is falling down. Room is cheap but there are several reasons for that.. if you are for business is not recommended... the neighbour is good and great place to reach the downtown,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"I have stayed in this hotel before and was pleasantly surprised at the start of modernisation.It is close to the town centre, the horse racing and crossing the border.The price as risen a few €'s but the rooms are so much better.Flat screen TV, modern bathrooms, new mattresses. Wi-Fi in all rooms. They used to smell musky and often smoky, now they are bright and clean.The staff are superb and very helpful.A few things can still be improved though.... There is no information in the room to tell you if the TV can swing off the wall (rather than watch at an angle). If I had been drunk I may have pulled it off the wall!It could also have more channels especially English.There are NO tea making facilities in the room, but you have a fridge that you have to turn off because it hums every now and again.A bottle of complimentary water would be nice.The coffee machine in the dining area is fine, but the water for the tea does NOT get very hot and you need to ask for the fresh milk.The maids start cleaning the rooms at 7.0am and should learn to be QUIETER. Not everybody wants to get up at 7.0am..... Not happy with that.All in all.... A very decent night at a very good price.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,For a very good price the crown inn hotel offered a warm and friendly atmosphere. I was staying at the hilton but a friend was joining me and we couldn't get a room there for one night so just needed a one night low cost room. The breakfast that the crown inn offered was just as good as the hilton and the staff exceeded the hilton. thank you for a very enjoyable evening.,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"I have stayed in hotels for cheap before, and none of them where as nice as this place and these people. The room was perfect, it had a nice double bed, a desk, wifi, a bar fridge, big closet, a balcony, and air-conditioning, everything I needed.The lobby has a nice large breakfast area, there food was included in my booking. I ate there a few times, but there is also a nice taverna around the corner (large chicken kebab is about the size of my head and the Swordfish was awesome.) The area is slightly out of the downtown center but it was 5 minutes from all my meetings by cab, so as a business traveller it served its purpose well.The staff where so friendly, even when the kitchen was closed, they got up, turned on the lights and made me food. I never had such a friendly experience from people, usually they just tell you its too late, but these guys where great. I particularly liked their Cypriot coffee, they know how to make a good Cypriot coffee. Walking distance was a corner store, pharmacy, hair cutter, and a restaurant.There is a little balcony with chairs that catch the evening sun set on the mountain range and has nice wicker chairs with cushions to sit on, such a pleasant place to have coffee and a puff of a small cigar. I slept fantastic, because there is no noise in this neighbourhood, its quiet and really a lovely find for a work-traveller.I actually returned from my trip in May and decided to stay again. Found some new coffee shops and will likely post another review when I leave.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"We decided to have an overnight stay in Nicosia, while in Cyprus for a month in Polis, the hotel was basic but of a very good standard, the staff were helpful and what ever we asked for was done with a smile , the only two minor points were the loud air con ( jumbo jet landing ) , and the small but adequate shower, parked the car and used taxis to get into city centre , to hot to walk. For the price it was a very satisfactory and clean hotel.",Crown Inn Hotel
20,"We had originally booked to stay at the Castelli in the old city of Nicosia but when we arrived there was no room for us, so the hotel sent us to The Crown Inn, for a night which was not within the city walls of the old town.That aside, the hotel was drab and dingy and the bathrooms were not up to standard. Breakfast was awful with sliced bread for toast still in the plastic supermarket wrapper, no butter just some awful margarine spread and the cooked items had long since gone although we were down for breakfast at 7.45am.The one good thing was the staff who tried their best and were very friendly, but I am afraid it is not a hotel that I would recommend.",Crown Inn Hotel
30,"A basic hotel with a small bathtub that would much appreciated if it was a shower. A fridge, desk, very small lcd tv and a balcony. Air-conditioning in the room very bad and noisy. Uncomfortable bed. Very limited tv channels.Not cheap compared to other similar star hotels.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"Just a short stay but the staff were very friendly and understanding when help was needed, the remote/TV was not working so moved to another room wonderful !The hotel is only 2 star but it is clean had a safe to use in room and fridge if needed.we could order out to eat in the hotel there was a bar at the hotel but we did not have time to use it.One thing would be good is to have coffee/tea making in the room.Good walking distance to the center of Nicosia and the broader crossings also museums and any Gov buildings.There is buses close by and a terminal in the center also car hire.Breakfast Basic but good being winter most hotels do not put out as much because lack of guests I have notice.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"Neat little 2 star hotel. Very convenient for what we needed. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Price is very reasonable for a capital city. Hotel is just off a local bus route into the city centre. Breakfast is basic but good, plenty of choice. Have stayed here a few times now and always made to feel welcome. Road works around the hotel are now nearly completed, so dust and smells have been eliminated.",Crown Inn Hotel
20,"Smelly and dirty,not only the rooms the elevator is dirty, the carpet in the loby is dirty,for smell i put perfum on my pilow and smoked a sigerate in the room but still smellbut the staff are lovely, helpful, kind, and you feel they are your familly.",Crown Inn Hotel
30,"Had to stay in Nicosia for 1 night and we found this place as it was around the corner from our friends.It's a very basic place with standard rooms with to and air con, shower a little small, it's ideal for an overnight stay.It's looking old and could do with modernising.Sadly breakfast had seen better days with hot dried food and warm milk for your bowl of cereal.Staff were very helpful and friendly to chat to.Mostly likely will not return.",Crown Inn Hotel
30,Staff do their best to help. Quiet residential area. Rooms are ok. but felt a little old. Reasonable price for Nicosia.Location is a solid 15-20 minutes walk to the center at a good pace. Only two restaurants in the area - it is mostly residential. Nicosia is a bit overpriced compared to the rest of the island.,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"Hello everybody,I searched a cheap hotel and found the Crown Inn Hotel. I get a room with bathroom and a desk. Perfect for me because I plan to start my study here in cyprus. But the friendlyness at the hotel is the reason for maximum of points. I get the best warm welcome and it will be not the last time I was there.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"We have just stayed here again for a couple of nights, while the hotel is in need of some TLC, you are always assured of a very warm welcome from all of the staff. The rooms are a little jaded but very clean and have air conditioning, comfortable beds and a good continental style breakfast is available every morning. The staff are so pleasant and helpful and really try to make the stay as comfortable as possible. Free wifi available in all areas. We will definitely be back.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 12 nights.Hotel staff was very kind and they were responsible!Just the negative point was that housekeeping did not make room clean well!Breakfast was well!As we were there for WFTGA Train the Trainer of tourist guides, we had coffee breaks and meal in the hotel and they were really good and tasty!We missed our moments there!",Crown Inn Hotel
30,"The proprietor is a happy go lucky man who welcomed is to the hotel.We had a corner room with a balcony which was a nice surprise.The good news really stops there, not the cleanest rooms and the breakfast was not good.However a fifteen to twenty minute stroll to the old city and a good option for travellers on a budget. Parking available too.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"Excellent hospitality , the room a little small but very clean and quiet . The breakfast buffett is abundant . From this hotel you can reach the area of the ancient walls in the city center with a 15 minute walk , or by city bus ( about 6 minutes ) .",Crown Inn Hotel
20,"The hotel is outside the center area in a calm neighborhood and 10 minutes from the Municipal park. But the room was with old furniture, very tiny, as well as the bathroom. The refrigerator was noisy and we had to turn it off in order to manage to sleep in the night. The balcony is enough only for one person. But the staff at the reception desk is very nice, friendly and helpful.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"The crown Inn is located about a 15-20 minute walk from the walled city. It's a nice walk into town and you pass by the Cyprus Museum and Pafos gate. I stayed 2 nights and the hotel was nice and quite. I didn't hear any other noise from other guests. The rooms are very clean and also have a small balcony, a fridge, tv and that all important Air Conn. Breakfast is a simple stripped down Buffett, the usual things like juice, tea, coffee, cereals, toast and also a couple of hot things like beans and eggs. Recommended if you don't mind the walk into town - although there are buses and they have details at the reception.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"Hotel is situated in a quiet area, close to the walled part of the city & no problem parking. Room was great & breakfast included a good choice of hot and cold items which were replenished all the time. Free in room wi fi. Staff were so friendly, helpful & efficient, nothing was too much bother. Would definitely stay here on our next visit to Nicosia.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"I usually don't put 5 stars on this kind of hotels because it is not luxury by definition but this time is different. Rooms are very average but clean and comfortable and cheap. Anyway, what makes it really a nice place to stay is the hospitality of the staff and manager! Although we stayed only one night there, we were welcome with big genuine smiles and got a lot of help to decide what to do in Cyprus, where to go and so on. We will definitely go again next time we visit Cyprus!",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"Myself and my wife stayed at the Crown Inn Hotel for seven nights and really enjoyed our stay.The hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful,the rooms are quite small but very adequate and the sheets were changed every day.The hotel is located about 2miles outside the city centre but the local bus service is very reasonable 1:50 euro and the check point to the North side of the island (Kyrenia) is just a short walk from the bus station.We also travelled around the island by bus Paphos 13euro,Larnica 7euro return.I am sure we will visit this hotel again in the near future.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Svetlana who offered us a nice welcome drink. We got a double room which as we expected was nothing fancy yet it provided all the basics - safe, towels, clean sheets, a comfortable mattress and a mini fridge. Rooms were cleaned and towels changed daily.The breakfast is pretty basic yet it offered several items such as cereals, toast, baked beans, cheese, ham, scrambled/boiled eggs and yogurts.The hotel is located in a nice residential area and its only drawback is the 20-30 minute walk to Solomos square, unless you have a car that is, in which case, I wouldn't hesitate to book here. Since we were a group of three, the walk was not an issue but if you're alone it could get a bit uneasy to walk back to the hotel after dark even though the area is very upscale and we never encountered any shady characters on our way back.Wifi connection is excellent and there is a very good connection even inside the rooms.All in all, I would recommend this hotel especially if you're not travelling with kids as it could get boring for them - there aren't any facilities which cater for young ones.All the staff but especially Svetlana were so very helpful - we would like to thank them for making our stay a very pleasant one!",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"The rooms were clean and tidy, being cleaned daily and the towels changed daily while the sheets were change day by day! The breakfast was very good! Very good service.....overall very satisfied and would be visiting again!!!",Crown Inn Hotel
30,"I stayed here for two nights. I loved Nicosia- shame Crown Inn wasn't very central to enjoy this city even more.Anyway, the team is welcoming, helpful, extra kind. Svetlana was perfect. She makes you feel at home. The whole team is there to help you. Wonderful customer service!The rooms are basic but nice. My room came with a small balcony.The breakfast was nice, lots of options. Coffee however wasn't nice.If you travelling with a group of people and want privacy and calm environment after a day or a couple of days in Nicosia, then I guess it s perfect. You can get a taxi to go out at night. The area doesn't offer much. You need to head central to find stuff to do.It s good for family as well.Thanks!",Crown Inn Hotel
40,We arrived to a warm and friendly 5* welcome to the hotel. Free parking and free internet in rooms was a bonus. Now I read folk moan about walk into town WHY? it's a 20 min stroll u pass through the Paphos gate you see the destruction caused by the invasion then the old town and your into Ledra street pedestrian only go explore...take your passport cross to the Turkish side full of usual tourist shops but if you go further and walk a short distance its an eye opener as to how poor and rundown this occupied side is. Back to the hotel the room was comfortable clean adequate for our 5 day visit it had all we needed as we were out all day walking..the breakfast although not a huge selection was again plentiful we usually only needs coffee and small snack during the day..in the evening after we had been out for our meal it was lovely to enjoy free coffees in the lounge area and relax and chat about our day usually with whoever was on reception they made u feel like friends rather than guests. The rooms are clean not fancy so if you looking for Hilton accommodation don't book here but if you want a good clean friendly hotel at a reasonable cost this is for you,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"We stayed here for five days and were very happy with the hotel. The room was good value and the heating was easy to operate. Breakfast was in a big comfortable room and the location of the hotel was very handy, close to various mini-marts and a pleasant fifteen-minute walk away from the Old City, passing a particularly nice bakery (""Artemis""). But the best of this place was the kindness of Harris and Sofia. Nothing was too much trouble or them and any small problems were sorted out quickly and efficiently. I'd happily stay here again.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"I've stayed in many of hotels across Europe for work. . This is by far the best hotel at at which I've stayed anywhere in Cyprus.As a business traveler during my most recent stay, I found the business support and Wi-Fi to be excellent. Indeed many hotels in Cyprus that advertise free Wi-Fi fail to omit that they have a weak connection, or sometimes only one receiver situated in the lobby. But at CROWN, I was able to work with high speed internet.The hotel staffs were extremely helpful and friendly and each one we met made me feel very welcome. Excellent manager.I highly recommend TripAdvisor users to stay at this hotel during their next stay.",Crown Inn Hotel
20,"The reception staff Ms.Sophie and Mr.Harris, nice of them to refund one night's stay and let me leave early. The breakfast was satisfactory. The proximity to the bus stop, the availability of parking space. The Hotel is very shabby. The room was depressing so stayed in the lobby chatting with the evening receptionist Sophie which we thoroughly enjoyed. The bed was very uncomfortable with the mattress in poor condition and sinking in in the middle and the bathroom sink faucet were leaking.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,I stayed there for 15 nights as part of my business trip and the hotel was good with typical breakfast and the double room met my expectation (like any european double room with limited size). The staff is the SIGNIFICANT part and they are welcoming and vey very helpful starting from the receptionist to the cleaner. The location is quiet and it's 20-min-walk from the old town or the city centre.,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"The Crown Inn Hotel is a quality hotel with excellent value for the price. The rooms are well-kept, clean, and comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful.The neighborhood is quite residential, so there's not a lot going on, but the old city walls are a pleasant 20 minute walk- add 10 more minutes for the major shopping/ dining areas.",Crown Inn Hotel
20,"I stayed there for 2 nights at the end of September. The hotel was not (that) close to the centre of Nicosia as I expected but thats ok. The room was very plain/basic.What I did not like was the fact that it could have been cleaned 'more' but most importantly the ants. OK, I understand that it is an island and September is considered to be a summer month and hot but it is UNACCEPTABLE to see ants everywhere, in the bath, in the desks and even on the beds.That was the only problem. Is a better quality hotel full of ants? I do not think so.. You better do something because the hotel seems to be cozy but...",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"We arrived very late to a warm welcome, this Hotel is in a great location and is great value. Clean efficient and very friendly staff, they could not do enough to help with advice and directions. Does what it says on the tin and for the price you won't get better.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"5* service at 2* prices, comfy eco hideaway - A guide to the otherside of the sky wallThe problem with Cyprus is the sky-wall. Flights are so expensive, that returning touristsdon't return. However, once you get there (hope is in the offing - reasonable flights arecoming), you will need this guideThe Crown Inn is a cozy, intimate, 30+ room hotel.Upside: prices, bed, bath, cleanliness, friendliness, a/c-ness, noiselessness. 7/24 coffeemachine, service.Downside: uncentral location, unfancy,Purpose: Decompress, reassess, ressst.Operation Manual:Access: they wil arrange shuttle from Larnaca airport to the hotel door @ 11euro, and backwhen you leave. lovely.Sleep: The room is noise proof; great isolation from other rooms. The bed: I dunno, I sleptso quick so well. Comfy double, no crack in the middle. hmmm.Breakfast: Goodinuf, dry cereal, hard boiled eggs, beens, bacon, mushrooms, cheeses,cuke & tomato, fruitsalad (canned) fresh water/melon, pastralami. The cereal is there 24/7,you won't starve.Shopping: minimarkets all around, great coffee shop a bit farther - the Coffee Island, a wineshop, bank, within walking distance.Food: Evening on the veranda, Sofia the Great arranges take-away from the localfood places, for us lazy dwellers. Armenian sent a fallafel (2.00 incl. delivery) Greek sent 15small spring rolls (delicious @ 2.50) for example. bottom line: fill up for pennies.There are also others, like like Arris and Svetlana, making sure you lack nothing. That's thebenefit of a small intimatic hotel.Transportation: taxis use no meter but costs are moder-rate (half of what i'm used to payback home).Speaking of home, the price: 1 nite in a basement room in Eilat = 4 nites at the Crown.If you like good music, meaning Greek, you time your stay when there is a concert:Kotsiras, Alexiou, Protopsalti (can you say that?), Galani, Parios, Dallaras, et al. Tickets are20% of their price when these giants go abroad, and the music, oh the music, makes youfeel so rich.Amnonymous 970",Crown Inn Hotel
50,I stayed here on a recent business trip - the hotel is nicely situated in a quiet area of Nicosia but still within easy reach of down town. You'll get a warm and friendly welcome and it is a perfect place to unwind after work. There are some really good local restaurants within a short walk and parking here is also easy.Highly recommend this friendly place - nice to stay somewhere with character rather than the vast chain hotels that have no local character. Will be coming back!,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"Very friendly and helpful staff (you can ask anything for Harris and Sophia and I'm pretty sure all your problems will be solved and questions answered ;). Clean hotel, close to the downtown, quet and nice place. Strongly recommend!",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"My husband and I have just returned from three days at crown inn. We had a fabulous time. It is small and friendly staff. I especially want to highlight the girls at the reception and the manager who are extremely nice hospitable, they really go out of their way to make you feel welcome and help you in every way possible.The breakfast were a real delight with a mix seasonal fruits, cold meats, and excellent coffee. Cappuccino and cafe late on breakfast.I recommend this place highly enough; it really was a great treat to stay here and excellent value",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"I stayed in crown hotel for two nights. Room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We slept very well there. Front Desk who was just an awesome person to talk with and who was so helpful to us in every way. Breakfast was decent and location was close to everything. Free Wi-Fi was a plus, as a business person. . I will definitely stay here again. I highly recommend this hotel!",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"I stayed for a week in one of the Executive Suites operated by the Crown Inn Hotel. It was situated just a few meters along the road from the Hotel, with secure and private access to the building. The location was great. It was just outside the central area of the city but within easy walking distance or just a few minutes by taxi at a cost of only a few Euros.Administration was first class. At the time of booking, I received a helpful response to a query within minutes from Harris Charalambous (Manager). On arrival, checking in (and out) was quick and efficient. In fact all the staff whom I met during my stay were friendly, helpful and provided good service.The room was fine. Spacious and clean, with a very efficient shower and comfortable bed. The inclusive WiFi was fast, reliable and worked perfectly throughout my stay - I used it daily for several hours. Previous reviews had questioned the WiFi but Harris told me that new equipment had been installed and I can certainly vouch for this.In summary, if you're looking for a reliable, safe, clean and economic place to stay in Nicosia, you won't be disappointed with the Crown Inn Hotel Executive Suites.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"This hotel is called ""CROWN Inn"" not without a reason: If you book a room here, you will find a treasure!A ""treasure"" of amazingly friendly and helpful members of staff who'll do everything to make your stay as pleasant and comfortable as they can :)First of all, there is managing Director Haris who had good advice for me when I really needed it. Then Svetlana who does much more than preparing your room nicely, and the two receptionists Sofia and Svetlana who welcome you smiling every time you enter the Crown Inn and assist with any kind of help you might need! Last but not least I want to thank Roman for showing me the most beautiful parts of the old city of Nikosia and for stopping patiently at every church and interesting mediterranean plant I could find for a picture ;)Apart from the people for which most of all I will keep my stay in very good remembrance, I can say that I really liked the neighbourhood. It's a quiet one with beautiful houses and tiny gardens, and in a 10 min walking distance you can find the Tavernaki LAMBROS with the most delicious homemade Greek Cypriot food you can imagine.At the Hotel, you can order snacks for lunchtime, too, and the breakfast has something to offer for every taste I'd say.As a vegetarian, I especially liked the variety of vegetables: fresh tomatoes, cucumber, olives, ...The rooms are clean and shiny - nothing else to ask for!If I come back to Nikosia one day, for all the reasons named above I would never hesitate to choose again Crown Inn Hotel.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,The Crown Inn is located very close to the City Centre and is very reasonable priced for such a central location.The hotel team are most friendly and make you feel very welcome from the moment you book a room to the time you check out.The rooms are clean and comfortable and I will be back the next time I visit Nicosia,Crown Inn Hotel
50,"I recently stayed at the Crown inn hotel for business in Nicosia. The friendly professional staff provided consistent service. Their service exceeded all areas of hospitality, from housekeeping, front desk and a big thanks to the Manager. Perfect location, clean rooms, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and delicious breakfast makes this property outstanding.GREAT FOR VALUE FOR MONEY. If you need to stay in Nicosia this place is a great choice.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"There was nothing not to like. The staff was amazingly hospitable and flexible, always willing to anticipate and accommodate what I needed, and I'm quite sure they do this for every guest. The room was spotless and extremely comfortable. Breakfast was ample, and available in a beautiful dining room. Of course, every interaction with the staff was met with a huge and sincere smile; I never felt like I was imposing or that my concerns were minor. Svetlana even drove me to meet the airport shuttle. The management at Crown Inn wants to ""go the extra mile"" and should be the hotel of first choice for travellers to Nicosia. I can't say enough good things about this hotel; in fact, my wonderful time in Nicosia is largely due to the kindness and comfort provided by this hotel. Thanks again Harry.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,A very nice & clean hotel. Ideal for the Nicosia race club & crossing the border to go to the North side of Cyprus. Staff were very friendly & when I complained that my room had a slight smoke odour (as a non smoker I found it horrendous) they changed my room without any fuss.I didn't get up til late so I only had toast & a cup of tea for breakfast.I will be using this hotel as a base in the future when I go to that part of Cyprus. I totally recommend it as superb value for money.,Crown Inn Hotel

40,"Nice enough hotel for the price we paid. Staff friendly and helpful. Room ok with a huge bathroom, clean, comfortable bed etc. Noisy fridge which we turned off. Internet cable provided and worked fine. Did not try the WIFI in the lobby. Located in a quiet district, 7 euros in a taxi downtown to Ledra St. Only letdown was the breakfast, bacon, (boiled) eggs etc only lukewarm. If you are going to do bacon and eggs please fry the eggs ! Good coffee though ! I realise the hotel was quiet but, breakfast is an important part of anyone's stay and, with a little more effort, could have been much nicer.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"Thanks to Harris, Sofia, Svetlana and everyone at the Crown Inn Hotel in Nicosia for looking after me and our course participants so well during our two weeks training course. Albeit not luxurious, the Crown Inn had everything we needed and nothing was too much for the team to organise for us. Harris prepared a tasty lunch and Svetlana set a lovely table. Internet access in the rooms was much appreciated as were the services of the electrician, who restored the lights to my room after a mighty thunderstorm. I'm already looking forward to coming back in the future.",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"We found the hotel by looking for good prices for an unscheduled stay. Was pleasantly surprised on every level. Exceptional value, great facilities, good location. They even have adapted some rooms for the disabled. This meant my elderly father was able to be comfortable, safe and independent in his own room. Loved the fact that absolutely every room has a balcony and nice views!The staff really couldn't be more helpful and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The manager is very hands on and is supported by happy staff with a can-do attitude.The biggest surprise of all was that this is only a 2 star hotel - in the UK it would be 4 star. Can only guess that it may be because they don't have a gym or offer full board? That said, they produce hot or cold snack meals all day which is surely what most visitors to a capital city want!",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"We were received very warmly and felt as though at home right away. The reception and hotel management staff - Svetlana & Harris - were very friendly and offered fresh orange juice / coffee / tea drinks upoin arrival. Hotel is situated conveniently close to downtown. The suite was spacious, clean, with high speed internet connection, cooking facilities, refrigerator etc. The food for breakfast and other meals was delicious.

50,"superb breakfast! place for parking! the staff were in general very friendly, the rooms were comfortable and quite clean. This hotel is a great value for money and it is located in a peaceful area unlike many other hotels in the city, It is not far away from the city centre- just 10 minutes away",Crown Inn Hotel
50,"This was a hotel with a little touch for us. Nice, lovely welcome from the reception staff that was really helpful and friendly. Welcome fresh orange on arrival.Although it is situated in a tree-lined street with old houses, the interior is very classic style. I arrived very early in the morning and since the room I had booked was not ready, I was immediately offered an upgrade, which I could not believe it. There was a very decent choice of food for breakfast and everything I tried was delicious. The room was clean. I will gladly return to Crown next time I visit Nicosia. Thank you all for making my 4 days relaxing.",Crown Inn Hotel
30,Hotel outside the city center in the quiet neighberhood. 20 minutes walking from the old town. Rooms not very pleasant - old furniture and very noisy refigerator. Very small bathroom. Breakfast ok but nothing special. No wifi in the room. It is suppose to work in the lobby but it didn't on my iPad.,Crown Inn Hotel
10,"I was placed in this hotel, as most others seemed to be full, due to the EU ministerial gathering. The room (No 113) was tiny with two single beds. The bed-covers had the most disgusting, huge and varied collection of stains one could imagine!! I felt like throwing them out of the balcony... The shower room was equally tiny and its door would bang the second bed when you tried to open it more than half way. One of the bath towels was near the state of complete disintegration (if you'd rub hard, it may fall apart completely). The bed was very hard and small and the tiny pillow filled with hard lumps. I could hardly sleep all night! There was a small fridge with half-broken shelves and a squeaky door that made a lot of noise. Decor and beds old and seriously unattractive. Dust was obvious everywhere. The front desk lady was pleasant (unlike the manageress/owner (?), whose portrait decorates the dimly lit dining room). Breakfast seemed OK, but I was in such a hurry to escape, I could hardly bother. AVOID, please!",Crown Inn Hotel
20,"Room was small and unattractive, several appliances didn´t work well or were broken. The location is rather far from the city centre. Staff is friendly, breakfast is OK. In the room only wired internet in a very awkward location.",Crown Inn Hotel
30,"I paid 45 euros in off-season, early March 2012. The woman on duty Sat. night and Sun. morning was a treasure house of information, clearly conveyed in good English. She was terrific. Breakfast was excellent, a nice choice offering eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, etc. A full breakfast in a very pleasant room. But--the room was small and tightly arranged. Bathroom by contrast was huge. (However, there was the hazard of a slanted-up entry of a few inches into the bathroom, tiled the same as the bathroom floor. I put a T-shirt there, to remind me, or I would have tripped repeatedly coming or going--as I did the first two times; not safe for old people.)Very quiet place in a very quiet suburban neighborhood (at least one taxi driver couldn't find it on his own). I left after one night because it is so very faaaar from old town, which is where everything is located that a tourist would want to see. You either waste a long time walking back and forth, or spend at least 15 euros round trip for a taxi. Better spend that money on a centrally located hotel, such as Centrum or Rimi, both of which I stayed in next and enjoyed them both.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"It is in a nice location.The rooms are very clean.The most worthy to mention is the staff , they are very helpful and always doing their best to satisfy you especially at the reception.I am an frequent traveller to Nicosia and I always book at Crown Inn.",Crown Inn Hotel

30,"An average quality hotel, at a cosy and quiet area of Nicosia, at a walking distance from city centre and old city of Nicosia.Bus stop (line 23) is nearby as well.The rooms were of average quality - pretty good for a 2-star hotel and the breakfast was adequate to hotel's level.Pretty helpful staff and good cleaning service were the main advantages of the hotel.Generally, it was a good value for money, but certainly at a price no more than 75 euros for a double room with breakfast.",Crown Inn Hotel

30,"I was made aware of this hotel from a list provided by my conference organisers. My stay did not begin particularly well. I arrived at noon on a Saturday to be told that it was the chef's day off so had to manage on his pre-prepared sandwich (lunch) and Greek salad which I stored in my room fridge for dinner. Breakfast was very basic as well with the only major ""fresh"" options for much of the time being eggs (scrambled) or eggs (fried--sunnyside up) in addition to cereals, cheese, cold meats etc. Food that I ordered separately was well made and in good quantity.The staff is generally friendly and obliging especially in calling organizations/entities that do not converse in English on one's behalf.The rooms are very basic as well with the linen clean but old. The bathrooms are tiny with even less space in the shower section. The TV carries mostly Greek channels. I loved its very intimate baclony where two people could sit at a squeeze which gave a good view of life passing by.Prospective visitors are advised to take a good supply of drinking water Like other hotels in Nicosia (including the /4/5 star hotels) one has to buy bottled water at rates that are higher than the market rate.This is on the whole a homely inn for visitors with small budgets.",Crown Inn Hotel
40,"We arrived very late at night at Nicosia and needed a place to spend the night. It was inexpensive, and what we got for the money was ok.We booked the place around 8pm online, and because their office closes earlier than that, they did not receive our reservation. When we arrived at the hotel, it was fully booked, but they gave us ""the suite"".I read on tripadvisor that the hotel is newly renovated, which is probably not the case with the suite. It was in decent shape, everything worked well, it was clean, but the furniture seemed to be a little older (incl. canopy bed) and the room felt a little muggy. We had two balconies facing the street, and the room was quiet during the night.The breakfast was simple.",Crown Inn Hotel
