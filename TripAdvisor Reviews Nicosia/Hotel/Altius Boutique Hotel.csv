20,"I stayed at Altius hotel for a single night during a business trip in Nicosia.The hotel was booked by a travel agency at the price of 93 euros, including breakfast, plus 16 euros for a dinner.The hotel was a descent lobby and my room was fair spacious.My first bad impression was during the checkin. I gave to the polite receptionist my id card, she immediately found my reservation but though I was the only customer checking in, I was asked to wait for a while. This ""while"" took 10 minutes. Moreover, I was asked if I wanted to be offered some drink, I ordered some wated but it never came.My room was spacious, the matress of good quality but the bathroom rather old. The towels were too hard and the cosmetics just basic. Moreover, though I was on the 6th floor, there was too noise from the street. It had a tv of 20'' on the wall, which is funny because you cannot have such a tiny tv 3 meters away from the head of the bed. Moreover the fridge was empty, not even any bottle of water inside. So, what was the meaning of the tea boiler?At night I visited the restaurant. Though there were only 2 more customers there, I had to wait for about ten minutes for someone to show up and bring me the menu.The menu had 3 salads, 3 pizzas, 3-4 meat plates and a few other dishes.I ordered 1 salad, 1 pizza, 1 beer and a 1lt bottle of water. Despite my extra charge of 16 suros for the dinner, in the beginning the waiter informed me that I can only have a single choice, and all others are extra. Later on he asked someone what is included in half board and I was told that I have to pay for the drinks.Remember, I was charged 16 euros for the dinner, my meals choices costed 12,5 euros (in the menu) but I had an extra charge of 5.5 euros for the drinks.The quality of the salad was fair, but the pizza was one of those 6 pieces low quality frozen pizzas you can buy at the super market.When checking out, I payed for the 5.5 euros for the drinks but when I asked for a receipt, I was told that I cannot get because my room was booked and payed by a travel agency. But It was me who payed the extra cost, how can they send this amount to the travel agency? The receptionist offered me to send me some receipt by e-mail but there was no meaning to spend so much time in the checkout for so simple issues, since I was in a hurry. It had already took me long since the receptionist was busy with some paperwork.In conclusion, Altius is a hotel that has partly been renovated, the staff is polite but seems amateur, its processes need reengineering and the restaurant is very bad. If it costed about 50 euros it would me fair.I hope that the hotel management will consider my critisism.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 18 Similarity:  0.35355339059327373

I appreciated the help in switching to a nicer room with a refrigerator to keep my medicine cold. The rooms on the whole were basic and the atmosphere/bed linens a bit tired, and the location of the property is a bit off the beaten path, but overall it wasn't a bad deal for last-minute.One note: I pre-paid online through Hotels.com because the hotel website would not take last-minute bookings and, when travel issues came up, called the hotel to let them know in advance that I would not be able to make it the first night. To my surprise, my reservation was gone by the time I got there. Luckily it wasn't busy or at capacity, but it would have saved a lot of time and extra effort on the part of the staff, who had to search for it unsuccessfully and then re-book.If you're looking for a nice place to eat within walking distance, I highly recommend the Syrian Arab Friendship Club restaurant, just a couple blocks west of the hotel.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 19 Similarity:  0.17677669529663687

If you arrive as i did at Larnaca airport the cheapest way to get to the hotel is via the airport shuttle bus to Nicosia (buy a ticket in the Larnaca airport office - on your left when leaving the arrivals hall) which takes you to the shuttle stop in Nicosia (8 Euro). Buses usually run every hour each way - ask the office for a timetable ready for planning your return trip. Taxis wait at both the shuttle bus centres - take one in Nicosia to the Altius (10 Euro). Alternatively you can take take a taxi from Larnaca airport directly to the hotel but this will be much more expensive (50 Euro).All Altius rooms have small balconies. If you like morning sunshine ask for a room with an even room number, for sunshine from midday to evening ask for an odd-numbered room. The first floor rooms can be noisy; odd-numbered rooms are above the hotel entrance and hear guest arrivals/taxis. Even numbered rooms on the first floor are next to a slightly noisier street and above the outside dining area from the restaurant so may be noisy and experience cigarette smoke so probably best avoided if you dislike that. Rooms from the second floor to the top floor (4th) are generally quieter, although there is some (but not much) noise from local traffic. The hotel is in a fairly quiet part of town.Hotel staff speak English and are very friendly and helpful. I was told there will be 2 English TV channels available in the rooms soon but you might want to take your laptop/tablet if you want to watch TV from home channels. Remember to set up a VPN and Sky Go on your device before you travel (check Google for how to do this).There are some, but not many, restaurants nearby but the hotel breakfast is good with a range of continental and cooked choices, including typical English breakfast fare. Evening meals are good value and there is plenty of choice. The bar is well stocked but expensive, especially for cocktails.If you plan a stay of more than one or two days you may want to make sure your room has a mini fridge (not all do) so you can keep drinks and snacks cool. The nearest local supermarket is very close - about 5 mins walk away (towards the city centre). Hotel reception will give you an excellent local street map. Look to your left down the side streets and the supermarket is about 100 yards along on the right and sells a wide range of dry goods, alcohol, soft drinks, snacks, biscuits and household goods (but no fresh produce or fruit) and the owner speaks excellent English and is very helpful. Prices are good. For fresh fruit you need to go a little further - maybe 20 mins walk towards the university. Look on the left for the store down a side street; it's on the left so be careful not to miss it - watch out for a shoe shop immediately on the corner (left) and that is the street you need. Prices are good and there is plenty of choice but only a little English is spoken. If you miss the store there is another even larger one on the main road you were are on, just a little further on the right (very prominent).The city centre is about 10-15 mins walk away.

We arrived around 7:30pm at night and luckily we managed to find parking space at the front of the hotel. It seemed that the hotel only offer limited parking space but I think there should be some parking near by. We were warmly welcome at the hotel by the reception staff. The room was clean. For sure the toilet needed an upgrade but still it was in reasonable condition. We asked for a family suite (effectively two double rooms jointed together.) There were plenty of space for us in the room. There was ""respectable variety"" of food for breakfast, it wasn't great but definitely not bad at all.

Very friendly staff, room was modern and clean, the bed and pillow comfy, the bathroom clean and functional and the temperature in the room just right. Nothing fancy regarding the common areas but they were modern and functional. The breakfast was mainly average, good coffee, only one selection of cheese and the omelet which was part of the English Breakfast rather smelling strongly. Not my cup of tea.

Up side: attentive staff, very eager to help; no charge parking; fairly clean room; decent breakfast included; 5-minute drive to old walled city.

Opted to cut our stay & move-on. Though untested, the Centrum Hotel in Old Town would have been a comparable & much more enjoyable choice. The 'Innocent' Wine Bar (Maria), and 'thegymconcept.'

The entire third floor smelled like an airport smoking room despite all rooms apparently being designated non-smoking (the smell even wafts in through the room's air-con vents so there is no escape even in the room) and there were no kitchen staff available to provide lunch at 12:30pm on a Friday. Most of the reception staff are very friendly and helpful and want to make you happy when you bring these things to their attention, but unfortunately the only solution is to make you move to another room. Also you may still get door knocks from some staff when you display the 'do not disturb' sign.

Pillows are on the thin and hard side.Room 2/5 - spacious enough, no mini-bar to store stuff, clean, but not luxurious. There was a nail coming out of a bathroom tile - a potential danger. Poor noise isolation so you can hear neighbours. That said, they weren't a bother and I slept well, but it's potentially a problem. Despite booking.com stating I'd have a double bed, I ended up with a single bed, though it was big enough.Shower 3/5. Bathtub + shower (I prefer cabins). Weak water pressure, but plenty of hot water.Internet 2/5 - fast when it works, but drops every few minutes - very frustrating to use. If you rely on it, this is a potential deal-breaker.Food 3/5 - breakfast was simple but nice with good coffee. Very limited menu for evening food, but ordering out is easy.Location 4/5 - quite central, but city centre and old town are just out of walking distance. There's nothing within the immediate vicinity however. The area is quiet, and there's a mini-market right next door. Bus stop is close and taxis are affordable. Speak with hotel before arrival if you want help with airport transport - there's a cheap minibus which will take you there directly.Overall impressions:If you can get a good price, I'd recommend the place. I'd say it would be better value if they fixed the bathroom nail, water pressure and Internet (which should have been done as these aren't expensive investments). It would be a great place worth if they sorted the noise isolation, though that would be quite costly so I can't see that happening.It's far from perfect, but I had a pleasant stay and would stay again for the right price.

20,"Air con: I stayed three nights. The air conditioning was switched off yet it was 26 degrees outside and with 80% humidity (a check on online weather history for Nicosia confirms this for my dates of stay). This meant my sleeping was interrupted and uncomfortable, waking up with beads of sweat on my forehead. Management were unwilling to deal with this claiming aircon was 'automatic' and they could not change it. This was not my problem - I had booked this hotel for aircon and was not provided with it. They then claimed that other guests 'were cold' and so it had been switched off (story number 2). However, each room has its own on/off control and so this second story also does not ring true. In short, the hotel tries to cut costs at guests' expense by switching off the air conditioning you have paid for and then present you with a 'computer says no' response when you can't sleep because of the heat. Oh, and don't think you can open the windows - it is way too noisy outside and this will keep you awake instead. They failed to provide us with a desk fan even after two requests from us - not even willing to compromise. Management then refused to compensate us - even though we had paid up front and wrote an objection on our check out. It is one thing to have broken air conditioning which hotels apologise for, it is quite another to have working air conditioning switched off and then ignore pleas from guests to switch it on. Management completely unwilling to provide what they had advertised and then refused to refund. Other reviews talk about the fact that when the air con is permitted, the hotel switches it off overnight anyway and then back on again - effectively cheating guests in a devious way. Appalling.

I am here now in October, day time temperatures are mid-twenties and the room is very warm at night - I have not been able to sleep for 2 nights due to the heat! After speaking to the receptionist and assistant manager, they tell me they are set to on ""automatic"" and so only come on when temp is over 20c. This is unacceptable for a hotel that advertises having aircon and this being one of the reason for booking this hotel. After asking to speak to the manager we were told he is out of town and cannot be contacted.

Accommodation was amazing, rooms are very clean, staff are very friendly and never hesitate to help in anything you need.Beside the accommodation, the hotel is a walking distance far from the down town where you can find all the restaurants and shopping centers.In case you have to visit Nicosia i strongly recommend this hotel.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 168 Similarity:  0.0

The level of attention received here was second to none and I'm afraid that if tourists start arriving in their throngs, the excellent staff might not be able to able to sustain such wonderful standards of service. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like a guest in every hotel should - special. The manager and manageress were kind, professional and accommodating. Breakfast was excellent and the waiters superb. The hotel itself is very clean and decorated in minimalist style. It is situated only ten minutes' walk from Paphos Gate. Everything you need is at hand including a lovely convenience store run by a friendly Kurdish man. My only criticism is that the Wifi could be stronger - but I'm sure they will iron this out.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 169 Similarity:  0.11180339887498948
50,"We went to Cyprus on business trip and conference in February 2013 for a whole week. The hotel Altius was booked by organizers, however I was curious to check the reviews on Tripadvisor as usual. How I was surprised hotel was listed but no any single comment showed. My first thought was either hotel is new or nobody stays there. I was right this hotel is a totally refurbished legendary Nicosia's Churchill hotel. After 15 years of being abandoned new owners completely renovated and opened under the new name of Altius in October 2012. Location is good to get to the city center and reach Ledra street in a walking distance of 15 minutes. Rooms are large and modern. All public premises looks like a kind of Scandinavian minimalism style with some historic touches from Churchill hotel period, like an authentic chandelier in the lobby. Hotel it is not big, about 50 rooms or so, however even during low season (e.g. February) the restaurant and a bar are all day open. The kitchen is trying to do their best, for example serving sophisticated traditional greek salad by adding extra ingredients, which are not necessary. The staff was friendly, we were offered by a refreshing drink immediately upon our arrival right at the front desk. During our stay several times we were greeted by a general manager within hotel areas. However the biggest surprise was a lady, marketing manager. During working hours she is taking care about hotel sales and on weekends she sings live at the bar impressing with her brilliant and strong voice, singing light jazz, traditional greek music and international hits in several languages. What a marketing approach, never had seen all working and all singing marketing manager at a hotel. Wow ! What else. Free wi-fi internet in rooms, ordinary breakfasts daily, refreshing Cyprian white wine after a long day. Hotel and especially the staff exceeded our expectations.",Altius Boutique Hotel,Review 170 Similarity:  0.12456821978060996
