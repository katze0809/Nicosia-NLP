All the rooms are fully equiped with all the facilities the client needs to ensure his comfort, including fridge, and tea,coffee facility. We found the Staff and Management friendly, and very helpful. I always stay at the Centrum during my stays in Nicosia.",Centrum Hotel
50,"As a repeat customer, i am impressed by the renovation of the rooms and bathrooms. Friendly and great value for money. Very easy access with the contact free check-in. Well prepared measures to practice social distancing.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Nice clean room, helpful staff, nice breakfast with fried, scrambled and boiled eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, Cypriot toast (toasted village bread with olive oil and oregano) and fresh mash tomatoes with eggs and feta cheese (a must) as hot dishes with assorted cold cuts. Fruits, fresh juices and a variety of coffee to choose from. All in all a pleasant experience. The only drawback is the wifi did not reach our room. I had to leave the room to get a connection in the corridor! If they fix this issue I will definitely be back next year.",Centrum Hotel
50,"The hotel is in a great location, the main street is just around the corner. We stayed in the traditional room, it was cozy and beautiful. Inside the hotel has lots of antiques. The breakfast was very good and the staff are very friendly and helpful.",Centrum Hotel
20,The Centrum Hotel is on a pedestrian street in the heart of downtown. The location is very good and the main reason I stayed there. I booked an Executive Room thinking it was a better quality room. It wasn’t. The bedroom and bathroom we’re a step above a dorm room. There was a tv but no English channels. My room was on the 2nd floor and street noise was a constant problem. The noise on Saturday night was particularly bad. It was loud and lasted until 4:00 am. WiFi was very slow. Housekeeping was fine for cleaning the room but failed to replace items. One day they forgot the bottled water. Another day they forgot the instant coffee. Breakfast was above average with a good variety of food. Front desk personnel were not friendly for the most part. The guy from…,Centrum Hotel
40,"I was in Nicosia on business and this hotel had been chosen for us by our company.No complaints really because the rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean. Rather than getting a taxi from the airport I caught a bus and found the hotel without any problem.One morning it was deemed too early for us to have a breakfast and we were given a packed breakfast which frankly wasn't good but then arangements were made for us to enjoy a hotel breakfast for the rest of our stay which is a choice of trad, English and continental so no complaints on that front.I was lucky because my room didn't face the local nightclub which did get noisy in the early hours of the morning: the only disturbance was from a mosque which must be located on the other side of the Green Line when it broadcast prayers early in the morning.Conveniently situated to go shopping / mooching around Nicosia or to walk up to and cross over into the other part of the city. I'd recommend this hotel for any visit to the city.",Centrum Hotel
20,"This hotel is very close to the boarder, and conveniently located to the main street.Other than the location, room and bathroom m are not clean, very rude frontdesk staff, and noisy at night.Not satisfied with this hotel.",Centrum Hotel
10,i went to the hotel lobby asking for check in at 11 pm where the GSA quoted me the price which i didnt accepted as it was cheaper in expedia.com and he badlz behaved with me and asked me to leave the hotel ASAP stranding me alone in the street. Verz bad service and even though location is in central CBD but service is very poor. I will never recommend it to any1.,Centrum Hotel
50,Hotel is well located for walking within central Nicosia. It’s 5 mins to the green line. Literally down the street. Shopping you will be well served. Business or pleasure well worthwhile.Room was spacious. Bathroom fine. Although it did take me s few minutes to work out temperatures in the shower. Room thankfully equipped with air conditioning easy to manage.Breakfast and hospitality with catering was fabulous. They guy remembered my room number. Interesting to see a kalashnikoff rifle strapped to the wall as decoration alongside copious bikes and sewing machines as decor.I would recommend,Centrum Hotel
20,"The only great thing about this place is their staff. All of their staff from front desk to house keepers to kitchen staff are GREAT. The hotel itself needs a lot of upgrade. Make sure you get a nonsmoking room. Do NOT stay on the first floor. It stnks terribly and you will find ants everywhere. Spend a bit more and reserve an executive room. The executive room is at an old motel 6 standard level and at least cleaner than their standard rooms. When possible check your room first before taking the assigned room. The breakfast is ok, and wished they had better quality cheese. Loved the staff. Ps: the dinning room and lodging room pictures on internet are much prettier than what you will find in real.",Centrum Hotel
10,"The hotel seemed great from the beginning. However, when shifting through the cabinets, I found a set of used syringes/blood on the shower curtains. I question whether or not the room is actually cleaned or not. When approaching management about it, they placed the blame on a diabetic that recently stayed at their hotel. I wouldn’t stay here if you even paid me, and their are plenty of hotels in the area that may not be as centrally located, but at the very least, are clean.",Centrum Hotel
50,"Stayed here 8 to 11 July as I was in Nicosia for business. I was allocated one of the traditional rooms and it was beautiful. Spotless and the bed was so comfortable and the shower was powerful. Breakfast was good quality, with a good choice. The staff were just so friendly and helpful too. It's situated in the old part of the city with so many food quality restaurants near by. I'm so glad I chose to stay here rather than one of the larger hotels which were so isolated from real life. I hope to visit Nicosia again and will definitely try and book Centrum again.",Centrum Hotel

It is close to Ledras street where there are all the shops, cafes and restaurants and near Solomon square- the bus station. It has step-free access to the restaurant.",Centrum Hotel
30,"I choose a traditional room, but to my surprise it was a very dark room. It had 2 windows, one was blocked with lots of rubbish and the other one opened for 4 cm maxim and we could hear the neighbors air con all night (The kindly offer another room but it wasn't better).The mini fridge wasn't plunged in, we had to pull it out and plug it and the TV remote had only one battery.Breakfast was good, nice terrace where you can eat,The location is quite poorly (no parking, we paid 10 euro for 2 night) restaurant and shops are very close by, but you should expect a your typical capital.",Centrum Hotel
40,"This hotel was very pleasant and not too busy despite it being the Othodox Easter weekend. Our room was mostly comfortable however despite saying that the hotel has airconditioning this is not the case or at least it has units in the room but they were off centrally. We had temperatures of the high 20s and 30s with the sun streaming in so sleep was very difficult. The staff were very friendly and helpful, breakfast was good, there is no restaurant for evening meals but plenty of others just around the corner. My advice would be to check directly with the hotel if air conditioning is something you require. Being at the top of Ledra Street it is in the perfect position to walk around the old town and explore north of the border",Centrum Hotel
40,"Hotel is right in city center, have traditional rooms and loads of antiques. Breakfast has some traditional foods and very helpfull staff. The only negative is that it was cold in winter, even with full on heating.",Centrum Hotel
40,"This is a lovely central located hotel. The rooms are simply furnished but have everything you need. Staff is friendly & helpful & breakfast is fine. Being a centrally located, it does suffer from noise though. The cafes directly outside are open until 1 ( even on a Tuesday!) then there is nightclub nearby which seems to open just after that. Around 5, the bins get emptied. I had read other review mentioning the noise so had asked for a quiet room which clearly we did not get. The hotel was fully booked so no chance of a room change. Ask fora room facing the inner courtyard & it may be quieter.",Centrum Hotel
30,"This hotel is a little more twisty due to its excellent location in the old walled city of Lefkosia/Nicosia. Our room (the “executive suite with a king and a twin bed) was clean and had its own climate control. There is a bit of night noise from the nearby club, but not too bad. There are so many restaurants, stores (including groceries), and other things to do within walking distance. The Green Line is also nearby and was fairly easy to cross over to the Turkish side.Breakfast was very good and was served in the Byzantino restaurant which is attached to the hotel. The lady helping serve was very nice and helpful, but the man working there was scolding my husband and myself about how we did everything. He didn’t like how we served ourselves and yelled st us about it. He also seemed to be yelling st the other lady working there, but since I don’t speak Greek I don’t know for sure.The rest of the staff were very professional and helpful, and the manager was very apologetic when I mentioned to him about the rude restaurant worker.Overall, a very good price for the location and a nice place to stay.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Our room was nice and big and the beds were very comfortable. Tea, coffee and a fridge were available in the room. Everything was clean. Good choice of food for breakfast. The location was excellent right near Ledra Street and the heart of the city. Bathroom was a little dated.",Centrum Hotel

50,"My colleague and me stayed at the hotel for 5 days and we would stay there next time if we visited Nicosia. The hotel is centrally located in the historical part of the capital. The central bus station (for city buses and intercity buses) is 5 minutes away. All kinds of eateries-coffee places, snack/beer bars, restaurants as well as shops are within a short walking distance fom the hotel (around 10 minutes). The tourist information centre is sth like 3 minutes from the hotel (we took a free walking tour which usually starts at 10am). The hotel itself and the rooms are very clean. The staff is sociable and helpful. The breakfast is variable (the cheese is top pick!) We stayed in rooms 402 and 403. To get into these, you have to pass a cosy hall which leads only to 3 rooms (401,402 and 403). Rooms 402 and 403 have a big long balcony to share but it was quiet. We felt like at home.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Centrally located, next to shops, restaurants and a bus stop. A typical 3-star boutique hotel, with very clean and cozy (if not big) rooms. There was a kettle, safe and free toiletries. Hot water was available all day as well as a very good free WIFI. Breakfast was basic, but satisfying, and when you enter the dining room you are greeted by a warm smile from the staff. The reception was very nice and helped us change room and extend our stay before check-out. What should be improved? More vegetables and fruit at breakfast, better air conditioners, more channels on TV; All channels were Greek. Other than that it is a very good and recommended hotel.",Centrum Hotel

50,"The location is ideal, in the old centre of Nicosia. One can stroll easily to all the sites one wants to see. The hotel has no parking of its own, but is five minutes walking from large parking lots where one pays 2 Euro per day. For newcomers-- a very helpful tourist information centre is around the corner. The hotel is fairly small and tastefully designed. Most rooms are convenient, but not large. We had a large room for a small extra amount. Very quiet, with a nice balcony. Service is invariably courteous. Breakfast offers anything one would want. The restaurant is not open for lunch and dinner. I see one reviewer's remark: ""Ok but could be better."" I do not know what could be better unless one prefers a large establishment with pool, gym and the like for a lot more money and a fifteen-minute taxi ride away from wherever one wants to go.",Centrum Hotel
30,"Room was basic but clean, although the decoration was a bit random and generally felt a bit cold and generally the hotel is a bit old and needs some TLC.

40,"Located so close to Ledra Street and offering a comfortable stay, Centrum Hotel is the ideal place to settle into as you set off to discover the magic of old Nicosia. Get lost in the ambiance, as you peruse the museum of old objects on display in the hotel. Sit back and savour the generous breakfast in a wonderful setting, as you are welcomed by a most gracious and attentive host who appears genuinely pleased to see you. Affordable, clean and stunning, the Centrum is a decision that you will not regret making.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Excellent location in the Old Town. The room was clean, a decent size, relatively modern. Good selection at breakfast, with very enthusiastic service. On the down side, the sleep quality was not great, due to poor soundproofing and bars/live music in the immediate neighbourhood (which continues after-hours, despite the hotel's efforts to report the problem to authorities).",Centrum Hotel
40,"The hotel is very conveniently located in the Old Town.Location is excellent, and the staff have been very helpful throughout.The rooms are clean, albeit a bit tired, we stayed in 401 which was very large. Sound proofing is not existent and if anyone on your floor makes any noise, at any time, you will hear it, loud.Wifi is totally unreliable on the 4th floor, but it is good elsewhere.Breakfast is poor. Selection is very limited and repetition is the main feature.Would return for short visits, but for anything lengthier, breakfast needs to improve.",Centrum Hotel
50,"The location of Centrum Hotel is in the old town. Taxi service is few steps away and bus service is less than 10 minutes. Though the restaurants in Ledra Street are few steps away, yet the food at the Byzantino restaurant (which forms part of the Hotel) is excellent. The range of breakfast for a 3 star Hotel is vast and is also served in the Byzantino restaurant. Staff at the reception and the restaurant are very helpful and willing to answer all queries. Check-in and Check-out were processed quickly. The room was very tidy. I will definitely return to this Hotel next time I will be in Nicosia.",Centrum Hotel

50,"The Centrum is just what a family run, mid-range hotel should be. It is ideally placed to explore the old city on foot, yet once inside the lobby is quiet and unhurried. The rooms are comfortable, newly decorated and airy. Prices are excellent for such a well-located hotel in a European capital city. I will certainly return when next in Nicosia.",Centrum Hotel
30,"Nicosia is a tough city to find a hotel in, and I was really hoping Centrum delivered for me. Sadly, it never really got there for me.The location of the hotel is one of its big pluses. Right by Ledra with tons of restaurant and shops, plus easy access to crossing the border to the Turkish side. You're close to a lot of good food and a lot of tourist sights. Good on that.The hotel itself just didn't work out for me. There was constantly the smell of cigarettes. The walls were quite thing so I constantly heard my neighbors televisions and phone calls. There were mosquitos in my room 2 out of my three nights in town. Staff were polite but not friendly. The bed wasn't very good as I woke up each morning with a sore back.A very average hotel stay for me this time around. Was it terrible?

40,"I was attending a conference in Nicosia, and this hotel was listed by the conference organizers at a discounted price, amongst other hotels. I chose this one for the location, and because the internet photos looked good. Upon communicating with the staff via email, I immediately found them to be very helpful (they helped organize an airport transfer for me, also at a discounted price). Upon arriving I found, in terms of location, it was great. Located in the older area of the city, it was literally a 15 minute walk from the conference and situated in a neighborhood filled with cafes, restaurants and bars. My entire trip, I didn't spend one euro on transportation: I walked it all.I liked the room because the furnishing and finishing were of high quality. Unfortunately, in the bathroom, the walls are so thin, I could hear other guests taking a shower on the other side quite loudly. But this didn't disturb me much. Also I could hear a guest speaking loudly on the phone from the next room. At night there was a bit of noise from the streets. But all in all I wasn't disturbed and I slept soundly. The bed was very comfortable, and the room spacious.I really appreciate how nice and helpful the staff were, there were several things I needed and they were cooperative.If I ever go back, I would stay here again.",Centrum Hotel
20,"Stayed here over the New Year with 3 friends – we had 2 rooms with 2 of us in each room.Let’s start with the good – the hotel is well located in the old city. Also, it’s reasonably priced. That’s it.My biggest issue with the hotel was customer service. My friend emailed them in advance to make sure that the beds were separated in the rooms, not pushed together as is standard in European hotels. This wasn’t done by the time we arrived, and it took another couple of hours for them to “do it” – except they didn’t do it. We kept all of our stuff in one room, went to dinner, and when we returned 4 hours later, it still hadn’t been done. Seems like it shouldn’t be that hard to push some beds apart. Even worse was a few nights later when we asked the front desk to simply call a restaurant and see if they were open as it was New Year’s Eve and we weren’t sure things were open. The guy at the desk refused, saying “I don’t call restaurants for people. If I did, that’s all I would spend my time doing.” Um, really? You can’t call a restaurant and ask if they’re open? Doesn’t seem like a day-long exercise to me.The other primary issue was the noise. Our room (108) was directly facing a club that played loud music all night, and also had patrons who enjoyed screaming outside of the club at all hours. Additionally, there was a weird buzzing sound in our room literally all night. It you decided to stay here, don’t get stuck in 108.Beyond the above – breakfast was terrible (but free), the shower stalls were tiny, and the hallways smelled weird.All in all, I can’t recommend.",Centrum Hotel

30,"Located on the outskirts of the old town of Nicosia (still within historical city walls), Centrum hotel is conveniently located, close to Solonos street. Facilities and style are a bit of everything, combining business with boutique, having modern and renovated parts combined with old and outdated parts. Yet, always clean, fully functional, and a friendly and efficient service. Room decoration could have been a bit more inspiring. Also, our views were horrible, and a quiet night is disturbed by very noise airconditioning infrastructure outside.All in all, a good choice, with some room for improvement.",Centrum Hotel
30,"At a really nice location with welcoming staff, it's a pity to experience a smelly air conditioning system, a more smelly bathroom and a really low quality of mattress and an even lower quality bed sheets. I think the hotel management must focus on the important phases of the customer experience in the room and not just the entrance and reception.",Centrum Hotel

Some street noise at night (inevitable given the location) - but not too much of an issue. Good air con in the summer heat, and a clean, relatively spacious room with a small fridge, tea and coffee supplies, and a small TV. Pleasant, helpful hotel staff. The only negative was breakfast - there was little choice, fruit wasn't ripe enough to eat, baked beans were inedible, cooked food was dreadful. We managed by selecting yoghurt and toast. So if you can get a hotel deal that excludes breakfast, take it - there are so many much nicer places to eat in the vicinity, you're spoilt for choice. Otherwise, the Centrum is a great choice for unbeatable location, and basic but good value accommodation.",Centrum Hotel
50,"We were staying for three nights, in February, on holiday in Cyprus. The girl at check-in was very nice and friendly, and was very tickled that we spoke Greek. Lots of couches and chairs and tables around reception. And there were sweeties there... The ground floor has lots of entrances, easy to get a suitcase in from; To the left up the stairs (or with the lift), one gets to the modern rooms, and if one went to the right, passing the small cocktail bar as well on their way, along a corridor, down a few stairs and along another short corridor with traditional cooking implements hanging up on the wall, one got to another high staircase which led to the traditional rooms. The breakfast area is also this way, at the bottom of the long staircase. The traditional rooms were wonderful, cheaper than the modern ones, and with much more character. Our room, had a very high odd bed, which was very difficult for putting on shoes, but comfy when actually in it. ;) The bathroom was quite small-ish, but not uncomfortable; it had a shower, free toiletries (see pictures) and a bowl-like sink. In the rest of the room, we had a desk, with drawers, in which there was blank paper, hotel information, shoe polish and a laundry bag. There were two bedside tables, the right one having a pen and a notebook on it. There was also wardrobe, with a kettle and free teas and coffees, a tv and a phone. The room was quite well equipped with sockets. The breakfast was very tasty, with a wide selection: jams, honeys, cold meats, sauces, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, fruit salad, bread, and a toaster, hot meals, including eggs, bacon and sausages, fried eggs, Greek toast, biscuits, local sweets, fresh croissants and bread, a coffee machine, fruits juices (not fresh, just sweet) and a very helpful staff member. The area was quite spacious, as it is also a restaurant, stylish, and quite Byzantine, hence the name ""Βυζάντιο"". The staff member was very friendly to me, very eager to help, and very willing to let me take photos of the breakfast for TripAdvisor! he's in one of them too ;) Very nice central location in old Lefkosia, easily walkable to the newer part, tons of restaurants and cafés around, and dead easy to get to with suitcases from the road. Main bus station is also very near. All in all, a very pleasant stay!",Centrum Hotel

50,"This was my first return to Cyprus since 1957-59 when I did my National Service. On arrival at the Centrum Hotel I was met by George at the reception and made to feel most welcome. George and Anna and their team were absolutely amazing during my stay. They helped me with the various location information and also provided me with medical attention following a cut to my leg. I could not have been in better hands, they were both very reassuring and very professional. The manager of the restaurant - Cornell, was always happy to greet me in the morning and made me very welcome; nothing was too much trouble and he really looked after me. Overall my stay at the Centrum was memorable and I highly recommend it - I shall look forward to a return visit. The hotel was spotless, the rooms were more than adequate and the balcony was huge. Ideally situated for all shops, restaurants and only a short walk to the historic boarder controls.",Centrum Hotel

The staff are courteous and very helpful. My room was a cool, peaceful refuge from the heat and bustle of the old city. The breakfast was generous and served in an airy room refreshed by cool breezes entering from a canopied ceiling. Eating was made even more appealing by the gregarious and exceedingly sexy Romanian gentleman managing the breakfast service. Everything was lovely.

50,"I stayed with groups several times. Great location in the old city of Nicosia. Part of the traditionl restored neighbourhood of Nicosia. The area reveived a Europa Nostra award a few years ago. Old buildings restored into shops, restaurands, tavernas. The hotel is located within walking distance from the bus teminal. Very close to Leventis museum and the Nicosia museum (the main archaelogical museum of Cyprus)....very close to the Cathedral of St. John and the Byzantine museum. Next to the hotel are two pedestrian streets with shops and lots of places to eat.Both streets will end at the line of demarcation (green line) that devides Nicosia into two.The hotel has spacious rooms with air condition and wifi. Offers all meals. Nice local and intrnational dishes.I can highly recommend this place for groups and individual travellers.",Centrum Hotel
50,"This hotel was a good surprise. It is in a superb location, about 50m from Ledra Street and 100m from the tourist office (free walking tours of old Nicosia). There is no parking at the hotel, but a municipal car park (€5 a day, less for shorter periods) is a couple of minutes' walk. Our room was large, with a double and a single bed and plenty more space too, renovated to a reasonable standard and spotlessly clean. The staff were friendly and helpful, and a more or less standard buffet breakfast, in a pleasant covered courtyard, was included.",Centrum Hotel
30,"I stayed at Centrum Hotel on October 2016 for 5 days for professional stay. The hotel is located centrally, or at least in the old city near the Green line and close to the occupied areas of the island. It is located in one of the many pedestrian streets in the area which menas that you are close to the restaurants, bars (good and naughty ones), shops and most important near the bus /taxi station. If you consider that in Cyprus public transportation is poor it is an advantage to be next to the bus station! the hotel was decent, certainly a lot need to be done but the staff is friendly and helpful.. The room size was OK, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was small, the wifi could have been stronger.. The breakfast was average and i do not understand why coffee should be ""instacoffee"" and why it is so difficult to prepare fresh coffee!! as for the breakfast itself, do not expect anything extra but a continental one..",Centrum Hotel
30,"Basic hotel, comfortable bed, clean bedroom.My room faced the back and that was miraculously quiet. The hotel is very central and therefore suffers from street sound if you have a front facing room.Staff helpful. The breakfast is poor. As it is easier to eat in the hotel I took the breakfast for three days but it was dull, hot food cold, and salad and fruit old.The breakfast waiter is extraordinarily 'helpful'. But this can be trying if one already knows how to pick up breakfast from a buffet.",Centrum Hotel
30,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during a business trip in Nicosia. The hotel is very centrally located, however there are better places in Nicosia. The rooms are ok. Wifi is free but poor connection in some parts of the hotel. The breakfast is medium.Overall, the hotel is medium, not bad but not so good either",Centrum Hotel
30,"The hotel looks nice at reception level, but the rooms are dated and very basic, not even a soap tray in the shower, and the mini bar sitting on its own in the corner of the room, like it had been dropped there, but everything was ok, apart from the street noise, bad real bad!!!!",Centrum Hotel
30,"The hotel has an excellent location, very central, and the personnel is friendly. The price is reasonable. Only miff is that the toilet needs refurbishment. It is five minutes walk from the check point and has great access to restaurants and cafes of the Lydras area. The room is clean and spacious but the toilet was semi blocked (to be fair we have not complained in time as we stayed only for 2 nights).",Centrum Hotel
10,"These are comments on the Byzantino restaurant only and not the hotel.Had lunch here today with my wife. The waiter was very helpful but the food ranked as one of the worst we have had in many years on this island.I had Kleftico, which must have been weeks old and it was almost black. It came with chips instead of the soft potatoes and the whole thing was inedible. My wife ordered Macaronia - which is normally macaroni with olives and tomatoes. Instead, she was presented with a mountain of plain spaghetti with a sprinkling of cheese and when she complained that it wasn't what she ordered, they brought her a small bowl of tomato passata.The waiter was very apologetic and charged us for the wine only, but this food was inexcusable - don't eat here!!",Centrum Hotel

50,"I've stayed in 3 different hotels in Nicosia while travelling for work (Hilton, Cleopatra, Centrum), twice staying at the Centrum when I wanted to be based downtown and walkable to everything. My room was clean and quiet, although my colleague said hers faced the street and was a little noisy until the restaurants closed down. There are loads of restaurants and shops just outside the hotel, the lounge area in the lobby is small but fine, the breakfast room is a little odd (antiques, and in another building) but fine. It was also good value at about £65/night. Only complaint - no pool.",Centrum Hotel
40,Booked for 1 night. Perfectly acceptable hotel. Friendly staff. Large rooms. I had no complaints. My room was a single. It was quiet. Annoyingly the power to the room works with the key. If you leave things to charge in your room. It won't work without the room key in the 'slot',Centrum Hotel
50,"This friendly family run hotel is the most central to Ledra Street. Very clean, very friendly and great breakfast too. Rooms were a good size, some with balconies. Also a small but comfortable bar area, and a restaurant attached (which we didn't use as we were booked in elsewhere). Can't praise this hotel highly enough. Was there with a group of friends a couple of weeks ago and one of the owners, George, was very helpful when my friend had a medical problem with her eye. I will definitely be returning",Centrum Hotel

But Stefanos and Anna are professional and extremely nice and courtaeous! Always willing to help out and make your life easier-Hotel rooms definitely need an upgrade (beds were nice to sleep on and clean)-Breakfast area was nicely organized and clean and the person in charge there made it even better with his very nice attitude.

30,"Recently stayed here as we had a wedding in Nicosia ..Quirky Hotel with some character. It was only meant to be a place to stay the night instead of travelling back to Limassol. On returning back to the hotel after the wedding, we noticed that the bed sheets had NOT been changed which was shocking. There blood stains from the top bedspread going right through to both the bed sheets. So i had no option but to complain to the night staff which he kindly asked if we wanted to change rooms. We were given the keys to the room next door and had to move all our stuff out. Stayed in many hotels all over the world, but ..Blood Stains...Not acceptable! Breakfast was okay. 3 Stars is generous.",Centrum Hotel

40,"We stayed in this hotel for one night only.Our criteria were as follows:1) it's should be within the walls of the old city within close walking distance of attractions.2) breakfast should be included3) it should be very reasonably priced for a one night stay compared to any internationally branded hotel.The hotel scored highly on all these points.Within the walks parking is not easy. We arrived late and parked where others parked. We got a parking fine for our trouble. It's best to park in the public car park, even if it means a longer walk to the hotel.Breakfast in the older ""traditional"" part of the hotel was good. Enough choice, good coffee.The rooms are nice and spacious. Try get one that doesn't face the street as it can be quite noisy late into the night. Bathrooms were nice and clean but I suggest they rethink the shower screens. It's a two sliding door affair where door come off their rails.Pricing was very good too, especially if you're staying for a while.I think we stayed at the best of the bunch on offer within the old city walls.",Centrum Hotel
40,"The charms of The Centrum are elusive at first glance. Once you learn your way around the neighborhood and the hotel, you will come to appreciate these charms. We booked an executive room which was quite nice- a big bathroom, roomy sleeping room and great air conditioning. The staff were very helpful and cheerful.The location is the draw-- near all the walking/shopping/eating areas in the Old Town. A taxi stand within steps and many choices for meals, coffee and hanging out.The included breakfast was adequate and the staff there were multi-lingual and friendly as well.I recommend the hotel for the staff and the location and would stay here again.",Centrum Hotel

We booked the Centrum in a hurry and without much thought. He is so glad that we did. He was obviously not at his best when he arrived but was given a cheering greeting by George at the reception. From that moment on George ensured that his trip went as well as it could, advising re meals, organising taxis etc and finding him the best flight home.The rest of the staff were also kind and helpful. His room was clean and comfortable and he hopes to return under more fortunate circumstances",Centrum Hotel
30,"Myself and my husband stayed here for 3 nights in September. The hotel is perfectly situated as we wanted to be close to the Ledra Street crossing point and as such, ideally to suited our needs.On arrival, we were shown to one of the 3 traditional rooms which looked lovely and we were pleased with our allocation. We unpacked and headed out for the day. Arriving back at the hotel late, we went straight to bed, only to realise that there was a lot of mechanical noise from outside. We hadn't previously looked out of the windows as they were covered by blackout blinds and wooden shutters on the exterior, so we opened them to find out that all 3 windows (2 in the bedroom, one in the bathroom) gave views of nothing more than brick walls, air con units, extractor fans etc. All of these devices made noise throughout the night, resulting in a very bad night's sleep. We had an all day appointment in North Cyprus so we left the hotel after breakfast and by the time we arrived back, we decided not to complain about the room as we were aware that the hotel was fully booked (having heard another guest moan about their room and being told he could not be moved).But a new ""issue"" was identified that evening.... drains. The shower and hand basin drains in our bathroom stank of foul water. We realised this on the second night as we shut the door between the bathroom and bedroom and when my husband opened it in the night, the pungent smell infiltrated the room. It was truly disgusting.So in summary.... the hotel is in a great location for old Nicosia, breakfast was lovely, free wi fi if you need it, but our room was extremely disappointing. If we'd have been staying any longer than 3 nights, we would definitely have complained after our second night.",Centrum Hotel
30,"This hotel is located very conveniently on the edge of the Old City . You can walk to the main attractions easily from here. Our room was basic but spotless and everything worked as it should. All the desk staff were polite, patient and helpful, especially George. Our only real gripe was the breakfast which was very disappointing: in a city of great food and a superb Saturday growers market crammed with the freshest and ripest produce just down the road, the breakfast buffet was stacked with cheapest quality supermarket dross, flavourless olives, wrinkled apples, rubbery cheese etc. With only a little care and not much expense this black mark could be turned into a very big tick and make the hotel really good value.",Centrum Hotel
40,"My hat is off to George, who was very kind and helpful upon my arrival and upon my departure 4 days later. The entire desk staff was very nice and helpful as was the staff upon entering at breakfast. The hotel has been around, but from my observation, properly renovated, especially my room. No complaints at all on the condition of my room. Can't beat the location either, as it is right in the old town and next to Ledra Street, the main shopping street in Nicosia.",Centrum Hotel

The rooms were spacious and the breakfast team were really amazing. Good choices for a hotel located next to lots of restaurants.For £47 a night, i defy anyone to find such a nice clean hotel located centrally. The only thing to bear in mind is car parking. There is a massive car park within two minutes walk from the hotel which cost 5 euro for 24 hours. And to be fair you wouldn't expect ample parking space in the middle of a shopping district.Thanks to a gentleman called George for looking after me on last night in Nicosia.",Centrum Hotel

30,"We stayed at Centrum Hotel for three nights. Its location right in the centre of south Nicosia is unbeatable. That, however, is also a disadvantage. With all the pubs and cafés around it tends to be quite noisy outside until early in the morning. There was even a loud argument in the hotel hallway at 1am which prevented us from sleeping. The room we had was clean, though smelly from the bathroom floor drainage (caused by rare use apparently - after we had poured a generous amount of water through it is was alright and we had to bear with the vanilla scent stick). The fittings were full of lime scale. The room itself could have a had a bit more decoration (plain white walls there were). Staff is very friendly.

However, you do get to see some sky and some kind of a view.

40,"Travelling often to Cyprus, but this time I decided to change hotel where to stay. You never know what to expect, but this time I went beyond my wildest expectations! This downtown hotel is centrally located in Nicosia just a few metres from Ledra street - the shopping area surrounded by bars, restaurants, churches and museums. The hotel seems to be an old building but very well maintained with a nice restaurant ""Byzantino"" which is connected to the main building through a corridor with old Cypriot artefacts. In here a reasonable breakfast is served in the morning. The only problem is to get a coffee/capuccino at the machine if there are a lot of people having breakfast at the same time ... but if you're not in a rush is definitely funny to sit at a table close to the coffee machine and watch how the very friendly waiter is addressing the customers ( ... I really had a lot of fun ! ). I was expecting to get a single tiny room ( I made my reservation through Booking.com ), but I had a large room instead with a comfortable double bed and a large bathroom plus a terrace too. Well equipped and clean room. Free Wi-Fi working well all over the hotel. All staff very attentive and particularly friendly. I see that many reviewers complain about the noise inside/outside the hotel ... maybe it should be because I was out all day to work and getting back tired in the evening but I never heard anything disturbing and I slept ( 10 nights ) like an angel !

40,"Out of all the reviews ive written this is by far the hardest. The reason being the hotel has me divided... So as most will read the top of any trip adviser review ive decided to start with the good points...If you want to come away with friends or your partner this absolutely has to be the place to stay! If you drive you are 5 minutes from the municipal car park which is only €5 for 24hours... If you come by bus you are 5 minutes from the station... All in all the location just off of Ledra street is unbeatable... Daytime old town Nicosia is full of shopping and quirky coffee shops & cafes... But its at nighttime that it comes alive.. Alleyways lit up with various bars & restaurants luring you in every direction with the sounds and smells... Its a truely cultural experience.So the hotel is superbly based right in thd hub of all this activity. From the outside its a charming building with a bit of old meets new.. Old shutters and balconies yet inside the reception/lounge/bar area is open plan and uber chic not at all what you would expect from a 3 star hotel!!The room (102) was even less disappointing, huge with a kingsize bed and two additional singles, balcony (side street view), desk, tv, fridge, hairdryer, tea/coffee etc everything you need really. The bathroom was in need of upgrading to bring it on par with the room but it was fine and spotlessly clean.Check in was quick and friendly and i was given a lovely big map and wifi code (a necessity in todays world). The wifi was incidentally spot on and i had no issues loading photos and watching a movie...So that is the good points...The bad points are if like me you were traveling alone with two children or maybe even if you are friends/a couple who dont like to go out late or drink the noise in the hotel was beyond anything ive ever experienced. Obviously the hotel cant control guests and its not at fault if there are a particularly large loud bunch of guests but it was near impossible to sleep with the noise, shouting, screaming, laughing, doors slamming, this was guests inside and not taking into account the noise coming from outside just with people walking past and their voices echoing through the room.Everytime someone entered their room the door slamming would vibrate through our room. This went on until 4am.I have to give my review completely and honestly and that would be if you dont like noise or want some sleep then stay elsewhere on the edge of town, but if you want to be in the midst of things this is the place to be!I will most definitely return to this hotel - but with my husband this time - where we can join in with the party scene too...Breakfast at the hotel is very basic but exactly what you'd expect.All in all for the right guests it delivers way above its 3 star rating.....",Centrum Hotel

10,"This hotel seems to think it is acceptable to overbook rooms. Arriving last night I was told a group of Chinese visitors had arrived so the hotel was now full, even though I had booked almost three months ago. I was offered another, hotel in Nicosia, one I have stayed at before and not liked, along with a cheap bottle of wine. Another guest, aged 71 and with mobility problems was in the same boat, and he too had booked several months in advance. When I pointed out that this man could not walk to the other hotel in the pouring rain here in Nicosia last night we were offered a taxi, which we took, only to find we had to pay for it ourselves.As the organiser of a major annual academic conference in Nicosia I can tell you I will not be recommending the Centrum again. You might book a room but you cannot guarantee you'll get it.",Centrum Hotel
40,"The hotel is very close to Ledra Street and surrounded by shops, restaurants, cafes. It is a lively area with cozy places to sit for a meal or a drink. The actual hotel is like a boutique hotel. Our room was clean with comfortable beds but attracted noise during the early hours. Passersby and the near mosque woke us up at 4h00. This was the only downside to our stay. Breakfast was served in the restaurant of the hotel which was tasty and plentiful. Overall it was a very pleasant stay!",Centrum Hotel
40,A sweet small hotel in a wonderful area around pubs and restaurants and beautiful shopswe got a small room when we made the check in and after asking to upgrade it we got bigger room much nicer with out adding money ...beds were comfortable and breakfast nice and the service was good and warmwho needs more?...,Centrum Hotel
40,We had a wonderful week in this hotel. Definitely budget but clean and the staff were extremely helpful and caring. They went out of their way to ensure we had everything requested and Corenlius at the breakfast restaurant was especially excellent at his job! Wonderful service and super friendly!,Centrum Hotel
50,I'd booked online and arrived late in the evening. I was disappointed with the room size and after a quick chat at reception was moved to the top floor and a slightly larger room. Great responsiveness from the staff. Top breakfast and the hotel's perfectly positioned for an exploration of this beautiful city.,Centrum Hotel
50,"This was a very nice surprise. The budget hotels are usually not my choice, but this one was really very choice. Don't expect luxury or so (this is a budget hotel), but everything else was just perfect: location 1000%, clean and finally the breakfast - very rich buffet attended by host, who was the most kind carrying staff I have ever seen!",Centrum Hotel

10,"I stayed there for one night during my business trip. Very bad location, ""red light"" houses nearby. The room was extremely dirty, sheets, walls and carpets were stained. The bathroom was tiny. Mini bar was empty. Two cockroaches appeared under the bed and a spider was found on the bathroom towel. I changed room in the middle of the night but unfortunately it was as dirty as the previous one.I slept in my clothes!!!!! Huge, huge disappointment. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. DO NOT GO!!!!",Centrum Hotel
40,This is a super little family run hotel right in the middle of Nicosia. I was there on business and everything went very smoothly. Basic room but clean and comfortable. Decent wi fi and excellent service. Great restaurants within a short walk. Highly recommended. Excellent value.,Centrum Hotel
40,Comfortable and clean room. You could tell there had been a smoker previously which was a little off putting. Breakfast good though the coffee machine takes ages! Setting was fabulous. Everything is walkable and the quaint little shops in the back streets are a delight. Helpful staff and a very pleasant stay.,Centrum Hotel
40,"Stayed at the Centrum for one week while sorting out documentation for my family. Hotel is in a great location if you don't have a car. Right in the hub of restaurants, taxis and shops.Rooms need refurbishing, but the rest of the hotel was pleasant. Breakfast every morning was well run by Cornelius, who was friendly and made us feel at home.",Centrum Hotel
30,"We stayed there for two nights, staff was friendly and the location was perfect right next to Lidras street. Breakfast was served in a nice traditional tavern in the hotel and they had many choices. Rooms weren't so big and comfortable but they were ok- average. I can say that we enjoyed our staying there especially comparing location and prices",Centrum Hotel
30,"This is a basic hotel with no frills. We were upgraded to the Executive room which had a fabulous balcony space. The room itself was like staying in student accommodation, the double bed was two smaller beds pushed together and the pillows were flat. The laminated wood floor added to the ""budget feel"" and the shower room needs redecorated. You can get cold water or warm water, but not hot water. The small fridge was a bonus but had to be knocked off at night because of the noise. There was plenty of space to hang clothes in the wardrobe. The tv had a few channels to choose from, but was almost inaudible as you could not turn up the volume. Breakfast was basic, the cooked items are cooked at 7 am and stay ""warm"" until you have them, the fruit juice is mass produced and tea/coffee comes from a machine, but the man serving is very pleasant and helpful. This is not an expensive hotel and its location could not be better. It provides good value for money for those travelling on a budget.",Centrum Hotel
40,"The Centrum Hotel is located in a wonderfully convenient position one block away from Ledra Street, which is full of places to shop and leads you to the border crossing into the Turkish side of the city. Restaurants, coffee shops and stores surround the hotel and you'll feel very comfortable walking to everything you need.The staff is friendly and accommodating. We were upgraded to the ""deluxe"" room after we'd arrived in Nicosia earlier than expected and the balcony view airy and lively. The room was clean enough, if not a bit bare, but everything was comfortable and worth the money.Note: There is no on-site parking, but a municipal lot is located a couple of blocks away and charges €5 for 24 hours of parking. The hotel does not reimburse you for parking, but that is a pretty small fee for such central parking.",Centrum Hotel
50,"This was our first trip to Nicosia and we wanted to be able to walk around and see the city. This hotel was perfect, central, great staff, breakfast and aircon! The room was a really good size and very clean and tidy as was the bathroom. As it is central is was easy to walk around and find again.",Centrum Hotel

50,"Great place, we spent an hour shooting up and down the B1 trying to make sense of google maps or maybe that was me? but once we found it it seemed so easy - so I assume you will be coming from the south on the A1 / B1 - follow the B1 into Nicosia for about 5 to ten mins and you will see a Debenhams at some traffic lights, there is a filter lane in the middle of the road for turning right - get into that and then turn right and then left and go down the right hand side of Debenhams - follow that road to the tee junction at the bottom, in front of you there is a green area - turn left and go for a 100 / 200 mts and look for a filling station on your right turn down the slip road into the car park on the left hand side of the garage and park up - 5 euros for 24 hr - there are some steps at the left hand corner that go up to a one way road - walk a 100 mts the direction of the traffic then look down an alley and you will see the Centrum hotel - this may save you some walking etc.As previous comments it is a great hotel, it says its a three star but it gives you a feel of a four - , 100 mt's to Legra street, shops, bars etc.",Centrum Hotel
50,"We stayed at this hotel two years ago and were impressed. Stayed here again this year for two nights on a girlie shopping weekend from paphos. Hotel will send you a map to get to car park, so easy, and then only a two minute walk to hotel. Situated right at the end of Leda street with shops and restaurants galore.

40,"We were in Aya Napa on a visit from our rented villa in Pafos and on the spur of the moment decided to spend a night in Nicosia. We booked over the Internet and had three rooms all together in a separate area on the 4th floor - it was incredible value and included breakfast .The hote is very central and thus difficult to find in a car - the secret is to park in the large central car park - 5 euros for 24hrs and it is then less than 5 mins walking to the hotel..There is enormous choice for restaurants and some very shops - you can also cross to Niorth Cyprus from Ledra Steet which is less than a 10 min walk from the hotel.The rooms are very clean, comfortable with good air conditioning - there is an excellent buffet breakfast.All in all exceptional value and recommended.Staff very friendly and lent us adapters.",Centrum Hotel
40,"This is a no-frills hotel very well located for exploring the cobblestoned old city. Staff are friendly and helpful. Good breakfast - though watch out for tour groups swamping the tables. Rooms have all the essentials though a few minor repairs would be welcome but understandably deferred due to the economy. From this location you can start exploring the city from right outside the door. Note that taxis stop a 100m or so from the hotel as it is in a pedestrian zone - if arriving by night, simply ask the driver to give you clear directions or escort you to the hotel entrance.",Centrum Hotel

Breakfast was available daily (included) and had a great selection with great service. Staff overall was excellent, making you feel welcome and providing recommendations. Free wi-fi, but the functioning was spotty in our room.",Centrum Hotel
30,"This hotel is very central within Nicosia within easy walking of a large number of bars, restaurants and the Ledra Street shopping area. Parking is in a municipal car park about 5 minutes walk away.Our room (301) was an executive room which effectively meant that it had more space than standard rooms but no other real benefits. The room was clean, bed kingsize bed was comfortable, tea/coffee facility and a small fridge. Plenty of clothes hanging space.Breakfast was good with a buffet cold and hot selection.",Centrum Hotel

30,A perfectly adequate hotel amazingly located in the centre of Nicosia's old town. Decently furnished and reasonable service. I had minor issues with other guests arriving back late and then having loud discussions outside my room (which was immediately opposite the lift) and also letting their room doors slam shut when retiring for the night. Excellent free wifi in the common areas (variable in my room) and a carpark close by (although difficult to get the GPS to find it). I'd stay again but not in room 103.,Centrum Hotel
30,"The hotel is basic and clean with friendly staff,placed right in the heart of the old townThe placing means that it's noisy up to 3/4 amWi fi is not good enough in the rooms at below 1mbSteer clear of the breakfast as it was virtually inedible and by far the worst we have had whilst travelling the worldBasic value hotel",Centrum Hotel
30,The Centrum hotel is an average hotel in the Old Town of Nicosia. Our executive room was clean but basic and sparse although adequate for our two night stay. One of the reasons we selected the hotel was for its restaurant but this is only open to half-board clients of more than ten. This is not stated on their Web site. A disappointment.,Centrum Hotel
50,"Excellent hotel for a city location.Friendly and helpful staff - all very hands on and welcoming.Our first overnight stay in Nicosia and I would definitely recommend this hotel.Rooms are slightly different from each other - our friends' room had a larger bathroom but not much of a balcony, whereas our bathroom was smaller but we had a dressing/storage room attached to the bedroom and a massive balcony which ran the full length of our room.King size bed (2 x 3'6"" beds put together but with a king size mattress). Hairdryer, tea making facilities, safety deposit box, free WiFi and flat screen TV were all facilities within the room. We also had a bottle of water and biscuits, which our friends did not (we booked with Booking dot com and they booked with Sunshine uk) - not sure if that is what made the difference.One part of the hotel is ultra-modern whilst the original building has been kept in keeping with this so you can choose a standard room or one of the traditional Cypriot style rooms.Breakfast next morning offered us plenty of choice - cooked or continental.We wanted to explore the city a bit further so left our bags at Reception after checking out and then came back to collect them later. Thank you to Stefanos for looking after them for us :-)In the evening we had a walk around the city to take in the sights and experienced some of the religious occasion of the Good Friday / Great Friday Orthodox Easter procession which ended at the square by the hotel.Lots of small cafes and restaurants are within just a few footsteps from the hotel entrance. It's also in a good location for crossing through the Ledra Street checkpoint for exploring the northern part of the city, or take a trip up the Shacolas Tower to the Observation room if you don't want to cross through.We would certainly go back.",Centrum Hotel
40,The Hotel has kept its standards over the year and the staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast is good. Its location is great and you have lots of Bars and Restaurants within walking distance or staggering distance.,Centrum Hotel

Close walking to all tourist sites and to the border of Northern(Turkish) Cyprus.",Centrum Hotel

10,"I have stayed there for one night last week . The reason I chose this hotel was only the position. The staff at the reception were very helpful and they did change the room since they have done a mistake with the reservation. Second floor carpet was not very clean and was quite smelly as well. My big disappointment was in the morning that I have seen a big spot of blood at the side of the bed's sheets just after I woke up . This made me feel so bad that I picked all my staff , left the hotel without mentioning anything at the reception and I did have a breakfast at a coffee shop near by !",Centrum Hotel
20,We took the kids at the Christmas fair and stayed for an evening.The reason we stayed was the location.Breakfast was ok.I asked for a Cyprus coffee (I would have paid it extra of course) and they told me they do not serve this coffee at the hotel.

Everything was bad.I do not think i be going there again.,Centrum Hotel
20,"very good location. but not on a busy street, so it is relatively quiet. huge balcony which could be great if you're there in summer.it doesn't feel like a 3-star hotel to be honest. the towels were tatty and one had a finger smudge that looked like blood - it could have been just a stain, but other towels were clean. a few stray hairs in the bed, but otherwise looked freshly laundered.Generally it was clean, but seeing tatty towels and bedlinens and stray hairs makes me feel icky enough.Maybe the traditional rooms are better. We were on the other side and only got to see the lovely staircase and curiosities on the way to the restaurant.",Centrum Hotel
50,"Very clean, quiet and well positioned hotel. Breakfast was generous and delicious. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Nothing eccentric, pretty basic and enjoyable. The only ""downfall"" was a small window with not-so-appealing view of the inner back-of-house courtyard, although it didn't really bother me per se. Personnel was friendly, easy check-in, timely room service. No complains.",Centrum Hotel
50,"The hotel is located in a pedestrian district of the old town. Parking is in a public lot a short walk away and cost €5 per day. Restaurants and shops are on the doorstep.

Breakfast is a combination of traditional continental, Greek, with a touch of British. The rooms have refrigerators, security safe and good wifi.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Booked here for 1 night. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the central bus station and literally at the end of Lidras Street. Location could not be bettered. The public areas of the hotel have been modernised and the reception area is excellent, as is the service at reception and at the bar. Bedroom was on the 1st floor and was clean and tidy with an adequate shower and toilet facilities. Electrical wiring is probably getting a bit dated but no real cause for complaint. Breakfast in the restaurant was good, the hot portions could be a bit warmer, the orange juice a bit improved and the standard coffee definitely improved although the cappuchino was first class. I would not hesitate to stay here again even with the few very minor gripes. The staff were excellent, nothing being too much trouble for them.",Centrum Hotel
50,"This was our first visit to the Centrum Hotel it was fantastic. We were greeted at reception in a polite and very friendly way and that experience continued all through our stay, as the staff here are excellent at all times.Our room was lovely on the third floor, with a balcony overlooking Nicosia towards the occupied side. We had everything we needed, including a small fridge, which is a great idea.Breakfast was a delight, with good choices of hot and cold and good coffee, which is not always the case in many hotels. The staff at breakfast were just wonderful, nothing was too much trouble.It is also nice to see the owner come in and see that everything is okay.Wifi is free and has great reception.A family run hotel in a great location, which is ideally situated for visiting Nicosia .We will definitely be staying there again and look forward to our next visit.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Great hotel, friendly staff, brilliant central location on the doorstep of Nicosia's main streets and night time bars and restaurants.Our challenges were that street parking was practically non existent on Saturday night as we arrived. Once directed to the large council carpark on the other side of the train tracks, all was ok. It's 5 Euro a night or so. Some of the electrical wiring in the room was a bit dodgy, besides that, a comfortable stay.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Stayed at this hotel in July this year with my wife and daughter. The location is extremely convenient - just round the corner to the famous Lidras (or Ledras) Street. Lots of eating places, pubs, small shops selling local stuff, etc. What we found most convenient was the the Debenhams store which had a supermarket at the basement where we could pick up bottled water, toiletries etc....- it was also the tallest building in the area and it had an Observatory at the top floor where you could get a great view of the city, all the way across to the Turkish side in the North (you can see some of my photos). If you walked to the end of Lidras Street you will reach the checkpoint where you can cross over to the Turkish side (passports needed) for some interesting shopping and experience! The hotel served as a great home-base for us to explore Nicosia and its interesting history - museums, handcraft centre, etc. There was a taxi stand just a hop and a skip away, and also a bus terminus with comprehensive bus routes, and even buses to areas outside of Nicosia like Limassol, Pafos, Larnka etc.We had a 3-bedded room which was large enough to be comfortable. The beddings were clean, very comfortable. The free wifi in the room was very useful to stay in touch with home and the office, and to get information to plan the places we wanted to visit. The bathroom was simple, but everything worked very well.They have a small restaurant called the Byzantino Palati Restaurant - that's where we had our breakfast every morning (included with our room). Breakfast was a simple affair - toast, eggs, ham, cheese, local pastry, coffee, choice of teas - what made our day each morning was the really friendly waiter who never failed to make us feel special!The hotel staff were generally very friendly and helpful - they have no qualms about recommending places to eat and see. And on the last day, they even arranged a special cab service to take us to the airport at a very special rate (well, cheaper than if we were to catch one from the taxi stand).All in all, we had a great stay there and would certainly go back there again if we are in the area.",Centrum Hotel

Good plenty to choose from, not their sausages but that's my own opinion. They don't do evening meals anymore but visit the one I wrote a review on you won't be disappointed.Staff.

40,"My family and I stayed at the Centrum Nicosia for 10 nights last month based on Trip Advisor reviews. I am happy to say the hotel exceed our expectations and I am happy to recommend this hotel to any traveller. The hotel is situated in the heart of Old Nicosia where the two main pedestrian streets intersect. Cafes,restaurants, shops, museums and other historical sites are at your doorstep. There have been many reviews stating that the area is noisy, especially at night. This is true but found the noise level acceptable considering you are in the heart of the city. It is part of the experience. I am a light sleeper and found that with the A/C on and the windows closed, it was not too bad. Parking is also a minor inconvenience as it is only available at the municipal lot across the street. Again, a minor issue. The pros out way the cons at this hotel. We booked a family room, which accommodated a family of 4. Each of the children had their own beds which was an added bonus. Rooms had a large bath and mini fridge. As mentioned in other reviews, the main lobby area is new and modern but rooms are quite basic and simple but kept meticulously clean. Breakfast was consistently good everyday. Service was excellent - particularly notable are Georgia and Cornell….you made us feel so welcome….thank you.The Centrum is a good quality 3 star hotel. I feel its worth mentioning we also stayed a larger, 4 star, hotel while in Nicosia and the service was not as good as the Centrum. Sometimes bigger does not mean better.",Centrum Hotel
40,"My wife and I stayed at Centrum for just one night as we made our way from Larnaca to Kyrenia and it was the perfect idea. We wanted an affordable, clean place right in the city and Centrum checked all the boxes for us. It cost us 73 Euros for a weekend night and we stayed in #401, which was a big room on the top floor. The receptionist, Ahmed, was more than helpful with our questions about Nicosia and gave us a great recommendation for dinner that night at Kathodon, which was right next to the Turkish border. Great hotel I would definitely stay at again if I'm back in the area.PROs- centrally located right in the middle of Nicosia and one block from the main strip- very helpful staff, who are there to answer your questions- breakfast was included and it was one of the best I have ever had- rooms are nothing fancy, but they get the job done- A/C in the rooms work and is needed in the summer- the bar in lobby looked like a nice spot but I didn't get to visit because we had only one night- plenty of great restaurants, bars and shops within walking distanceCON- parking is a few blocks away and can be a struggle if you have luggage",Centrum Hotel
40,"The centrum is exceptionally located and is an excellent value for money hotel. Breakfast is perhaps the best 3 star meal I've ever had, with many hot and cold options. The lobby has been recently renovated, but not the rooms, which wile very spacious, are starting to look tired and dated. The other minor drawback is the street noise. We were on level 1 so maybe higher up floors might be better. But this is to be expected when you are right in the centre of town.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Excellent location, nice and quite hall with comfortable sofas to spend a little time working or set a business meeting. The room is very clean, tidy and dress up with all necessary things.

50,Friendly staff. Nice breakfast buffet. Perfect location. Good room with good beds and decent shower.Minor point: We missed the fresh orange juice at breakfast considering it was orange season. Bathroom could use a bit of an upgrade,Centrum Hotel
50,"Perfect location at the very beginning of Ledra street (at the end of which there is the border with the occupied part), right after the old city walls. The location is perfect if you are coming to Nicosia by car, because you can park your car in a public parking place right outside the city wall, 2 minutes walking distance from the hotel! We paid 5 euro for around 20 hours parking, I think it becomes 10 euro reaching 24 hours. It is very close to bars, restaurants, pubs of any kind. The breakfast menu is very rich and the staff was very friendly also when we asked for indications to cross the border with the car, the insurance for the car etc..Rooms very clean (including the toilet, very clean as well). We took what they call a ""traditional room"" which is slightly more expensive than the normal room. It was nice but maybe not necessary if you want to save a bit of money.",Centrum Hotel
40,"We stayed in the Centrum for one night in Nicosia in May. It is a typical tourist hotel in the old city with good access to shopping, restaurants and cool places to people watch. Reasonable prices also does not hurt.

There are 3 traditional rooms but we did not stay in one of these.The room was large enough but with 3 single beds in it (we booked a twin) there was not lots of space but enough.There was coffee making facilities and complimentary cake upon arrival!The beds are very comfortable but be prepared to be woken early by the call to prayer from the Mosque on the Turkish side. I really liked this but some could consider it a rude awakening!Breakfast was good and plentiful.I would highly recommend here, both the hotel and Nicosia, by far my favourite place in Cyprus!",Centrum Hotel
50,"I spent 3 days in Nicosia on my recent business trip to Cyprus and I chose to stay at this hotel this time. If you ask me about my experience I would say that it was indeed very much like staying with friends and it is something I appreciated a lot. You see, it is a Family Business and the people running it are professionals. The welcome was hearty and the entire stay great.STAFF AND SERVICE: Although I arrived quite early that morning due to a business meeting I had at noon, I never had to wait as it usually happens in other hotels. I was almost sure that my luggage would be kept at a store room until I return from this appointment but this did not happen. I was handed the key and I had time to even unpack and have a cup of coffee before setting off for the meeting. Service here was excellent and both the Management and Staff proved professionals.LOCATION: It could not be better. Centrally located in Eleftherias Square, directly adjacent to the Municipal Hall, the General Post Office and major Banks. Its perfect position keeps traffic noise away since it is on the paved area. Guests coming by bus will find the location unique since the central bus station at Solomou Square is only a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Fairly easy to be spotted, and only steps away from the buffer zone, shops and restaurants, churches, cultural establishments and museums.The Tourist Information Office is within a 5-minute walk from here, and an ATM machine is also in short proximity from the hotel.BUILDING: Part of the Atrium is a traditional 1912 historic building, fully renovated, combining modern comforts but at the same time retaining its traditional Cypriot charm with an intimate atmosphere and 3 categories of rooms of different standards.ACOMMODATION: The hotel was fully booked during my stay and I was not able to experience a stay at an Executive or a Club room, not even had the chance to see what the rooms look like. My own room was a standard one but it was impeccably clean and spacious and I had no problem staying in it. The double bed was comfortable all right, the room provided complimentary coffee/tea facilities, a safe, a hair-drier, a 20inch color TV with local and satellite channels, a mini fridge, a computer point and a digital telephone. Internet in the room was mostly fast but there were times when it was slow as well. I never used the air conditioning or the heating unit of my room as there was no need to so I cannot comment on them.The balcony was O.K. but it overlooked a narrow road and I could see only the terraces of the opposite buildings. I was mostly out however, so this was not a problem at all. For me it functioned only to light up the room.TREAT: A complimentary treat of some cake and a bottle of water happily surprised me. I found them in the room when I returned from my first appointment that same day and I had them to accompany my afternoon cup of coffee in the room while I was working on the computer.BATHROOM: Surprisingly the bathroom was big with a bath tub. I like “walking” in my room and bathroom and this is how it was out here. I hate small rooms or tiny small bathrooms that lack space. It had a high ceiling and much light. Toiletries included a vanity kit, a shampoo/shower gel and a plastic cap. The room’s wardrobe proved handy as well just as the ‘working desk’ and mirror.LOUNGE/BAR: Nicely decorated, comfortable seating area, and a very pleasant atmosphere and positive energy is what you get out here. Smoking always bothers me, but I never noticed cigarette smoke at the lounge. I have also no idea if smoking is allowed by the bar. In the rooms for sure it is prohibited.BREAKFAST: I found breakfast both interesting and satisfying and it was enough to fill you up till late afternoon. It was not the continental breakfast we find in some hotels abroad. Everything was fresh and the variety was ample. Cereals, eggs and bacon, ham and sausages, croissants and different types of bread, fresh cucumber and tomatoes, yoghurt, honey, seasonal fruit, a fruit salad, cheese, (haloumi) olives, and 3 types of juice.Breakfast is normally taken either in the indoor breakfast patio or the outdoor courtyard. The weather was lovely so I had mine in the courtyard which leads directly to “Laiki Yitonia” the well-known restored and paved touristy area of Nicosia. Guests love to have a stroll out here, do their shopping –mostly Cypriot souvenirs and delicacies. You will find several restaurants and coffee shops even supermarkets in the round area too. Between us I find no reason to leave the hotel and go to another restaurant because Byzantino offers excellent cuisine and Traditional Cypriot hospitality.RESTAURANT: The Byzantino is the original old 1912 historic building and its interior is beautifully decorated, -not to mention the imposing arches that travel you to another era. It can easily be considered one of the Signature Cypriot restaurants in Nicosia. The food I tried on both nights was excellent, the service was impeccable and the staff super. Cornelius and Lili are truly professionals and they know exactly how to treat their guests. They are both discreet, observant and show up the moment the customer needs something. They work fast and accurate and they deserve a big bravo.If you really want to try the authentic Cypriot cuisine, I assure that you won’t find a better restaurant serving Cypriot dishes close by. The Cypriot Chef whose name I miss is doing an excellent job out here. The restaurant is popular on its own, and daily there are coaches from different parts of the island with locals and tourists coming in for lunch or dinner.WI FI: There is Free wireless high speed internet access in the entire hotel.SPECIAL FACILITIES: The hotel prides for its banqueting and conference spaces which are ideal for business meetings or special events.IN ALL: I highly recommend it for its homely atmosphere, the excellent and impeccable service, its superb location, the professional management and staff, and the tasty Cypriot cuisine.Keep the good work up guys!",Centrum Hotel
40,"The hotel was centrally located on the shopping street. It had a wonderful little bar with a great bartender. The room was spacious with a nice balcony and wifi.

50,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights as a business traveler on March 9, 2014. The hotel is in the center of the downtime near everything a traveler needed. It was a good location. It is a good place for shopping as well as for business. I have booked an executive room, which was spacious, clean, with decent furniture. My room had a window to the Turkish part of Nicosia. Toilet is very clean and needed toiletry. Staff were very helpful and their English was good. The only thing that bother me is the safe box, which did not work. As for the breakfast, it has variety of fruits, honey, jams, pastries, eggs, beverages, cold and hot. Internet was available in all hotel area, and in the lobby, the hotel provide free coffee machine for guests. I enjoyed the hotel.",Centrum Hotel

50,The staff at this hotel are very helpful and only too happy to help you at anytime.The location of this hotel is very good for the main areas of Nicosia around the check point area. There are a number of nice bars and restaurants in the area and the staff will help and guide you depending on your preferences.The rooms are clean and more than adequate although my air-con unit was a little noisy but that would be a minor complaint.With respect to the facilities a good bar area is available and a nice restaurant area although I only took breakfast which was good.,Centrum Hotel

30,"I stayed here 1 night on business. It is located in the centre and so excellent if you want to walk about and be close to the bars and restaurants. This in turn means noise up to the end of the night but so long as you know that it is OK.The reception area is lovely and the staff were very helpful and welcoming.The room however was dusty, small, uncomfortable and the bathroom is old and mine could have been cleaner. The balcony of my room whilst nice to look out on the town was bigger than the room itself!I also lose patience with this pushing of 2 separately made up single beds together to imply a double bed - it is not and it's uncomfortable.Room did not really have the space to have an effective work area so I ended up working on the bed.As it is in the old part of town there is simply nowhere to park and for me (being collected by my customer) meant a short walk out to the street to meet them.Breakfast was included in the price which is good and was of a quality you get in any other hotel.Again, the staff are excellent but the room left me disappointed.",Centrum Hotel
40,"This was our second visit and we stayed in a traditional room this time. It was well ordered, although a lamp did not work and the room was quite small. The high bed was very comfy.The tv was oddly placed and hard to watch from the bed as the bed post obstructed the view of the screenThe welcome on the desk as we arrived and at the bar was good. the breakfast was not as good as last time, but could easily be improved by making a few changes. The fried eggs were over cooked and had dried up - looked as if they had been in the warmer for a long time. The drinks machine produced very mediocre coffee and required a waitress to explain how it worked to all clients. Much better to make proper coffee fresh for guests. Fresh hot rolls were tasty, and there was a good variety of food available.",Centrum Hotel
30,"This hotel is ideally located in the old town and very handy for bars and restaurants.Parking is a nightmare. We arrived and drove around for half an hour before being able to leave the car anywhere. The parking is in a public car park accessed from Stasinou, it was packed when we arrived and had to wait for a space. It is E5 for 10 hours (Dec 2013). I’m not sure how vigilant they are about the pay and display but we were not diligent at popping back every 10 hours and didn’t get a parking ticket. The car park is only 2 minutes from the hotel.We had an ‘Executive’ room. It was large enough and had a big bed but the fittings could have been better. The shower was hopeless as the water just came out of the head and ran down the shower hose. Plenty of hot water though.Breakfast was Ok although the hot food consisted of some congealed fried eggs and some bacon. This put me off thinking of eating in the restaurant in the evening (we chose to eat elsewhere).",Centrum Hotel
50,"My first time to Cyprus and I didnt book in advance. Found Centrum hotel in city center (only 5 minutes walk from bus stop where main buses arrive/leave from Larnaca/Limassol/Paphos). I arrived at 10 am and because they were not fully booked the night before they gave a room straigh away for the same price. Room and bathroom where very clean. Free wifi in lobby and very central location, pretty good breakfast and very helpful staff. Especially I like to mention Stefanos and Ahmed from front desk who made my stay special and gave great recommodations. If I return to Cyprus one day I will definitely stay here again and/or recommend to friends/colleagues. Good value for money!",Centrum Hotel
40,"This is now my preferred hotel to stay in in Nicosia. The location is perfect for those wanting to enjoy the vibrant bars and restaurants in old Nicosia. The rooms are basic but very clean and the beds are really comfortable, You can also get WIFI in the bedrooms which suits me because I stay there on business. I also like the fact that most of the rooms have large balconies. The staff are very friendly and helpful especially Georgia on reception. Breakfast is pretty average though but this seems to be true for most hotels in this part of Nicosia.",Centrum Hotel
40,"The hotel is right in the centre near to the shops and cafes. Our room was a standard room which was adequate, but we did have a large balcony. Room was clean and beds very comfy and cleaners in each day. Breakfast offers a hot and cold selection but the hot selection wasn't very appetising, however the alternatives are plentiful and staff helpful so can't complain. I would recommend this hotel.",Centrum Hotel
40,"The hotel is just off Ledras Street and really is perfectly located to visit central Nicosia on foot. which is great because driving in Nicosia is, well, erm...exhilarating at times. The nearby open-air car park costs 5 euros per day and is about 200m from the hotel as stated on their website.Upon arrival, we were given an ""executive"" room on the second floor. It was spacious, well-equipped and had two enormous twin beds pushed together. Tea and coffee-making facilities were a welcome sight too. Free wi-fi in your room was an added bonus. You couldn't really enjoy the terrace as the rear of the hotel overlooks a dense wall of buildings (and you are opposite people's balconies and looking into their living-rooms) but that is not why we chose this hotel.Breakfast was fair and the hotel itself clean, modern-looking and efficient. The only negative point was the noise from residents next door banging the doors without a thought for others (but I got my own back by letting mine bang a few times). We also wanted to try the hotel's ""Byzantino"" restaurant which had an appealing menu of traditional Chypriot fare but it was only serving groups when we were there.We enjoyed our two nights at the hotel and found it great value.",Centrum Hotel

30,"Maybe the most central hotel in Nicosia, next to shopping district, bars, cafeterias, night life. They gave us the traditional rooms, on the back side of the building, with a light traditional decoration and a feeling you are staying in a mansion house. Rather clean, but has to improve details. Fare breakfast but not excellent, breakfast venue needs renewal. The staff is over friendly some times... to tell the truth I am not thrilled, because it showed to be good in papers, but bad in details...",Centrum Hotel
40,"We arrived at the amazingly located Centrum Hotel and were met with a wonderfully smiling face and felt welcomed immediately. The only downside is that we checked into our room (204) and although it was nice, it was dark, not well maintained and had no view at all. We spent one night and asked to change the room. The next morning another smiling face greeted us and gave us another room saying ""this is a good one'. When we walked in, it was very good indeed and changed our view of the hotel. Breakfast was wonderful and romantically opened onto a pedestrian street.The amazing service just kept on going with the very charming breakfast staff. When we finally left, the staff helped us get a taxi back to the airport without a hesitation. It seems they all have had some form of training to make people feel great.We would definitely stay at this place again.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Stayed here for a conference so have no idea about value for money. But it was comfortably cool with wifi in bedroom. Large rooms. Wonderful breakfast with very efficient staff. As a veggie, one of the few places I could find enough variety to eat well. Con: room stank of smoke on first day. Pro: right at the heart of the city (and I didn't notice any noise from outside, maybe because I had an inner, first floor room); close to the bus station. Helpful staff.",Centrum Hotel
40,This hotel has been renovated not long ago. It is located just inside the wall of the old city of Nicosia. The rooms are clean and the staff is very good and helpful there is free wifi through tout the hotel. The breakfast is good although the last time I found the eggs cold. The person responsible corrected that the next day and made sure I noticed the change. The price is very good for this type of hotel.The only slight deficiency is the AC in the room. It s good but not excellent.,Centrum Hotel
40,"It was our second time staying in Centrum Hotel Nicosia and as good as the first one. The hotel is located perfectly for Nicosia Old Town - everything is within walking distance. This however comes with a lot of noise, even during nighttime, as there's usually lots of Cypriot guys shouting at each other in the central square all night long.. :) The noise isolation in hotel is not very good, you can hear your neighbours and if somebody is walking on corridor. But that's about the only bad thing I can think of. The rooms are simple but very nice and you have all you need. Two bottles of water and a cake was also a very nice touch! And having a fridge you can use for your own drinks in the hot Cypriot summer is a great thing too.Breakfast is also good, and it's definitely worth mentioning the guy who is attending the dining area during the breakfast (I shall ask his name next time) - he is really doing his best for everyone to enjoy the breakfast as much as possible. Always a pleasure to meet him!Overall - a good hotel for a stay in Nicosia's Old Town! Not so great if you are after peace and quiet though.",Centrum Hotel

30,"I really like the hotel and staff. It was clean, the room were spacious, location very convenient to the sights and the breakfast superb.However, it's loud. You can hear everything going down on the street below and as it's in the tourist/bar district, you're always going to hear stuff going on and Cypriots fulfilling the Southern European stereotype of always yelling at each other. That and there's a busy street nearby where people love to cruise with those silly souped up rice-rocket cars and motorcycles.All-in-all, like I said, it's a great place to stay for the price, but you're going to have lots of noise to deal with.",Centrum Hotel
20,"We booked two Standard Rooms for six nights and arrived dead tired after an all-day flight from Italy via Frankfurt and Athens (me) and an overnight flight from Canada (my friend). We were placed in what the hotel calls a ""Traditional Room"" in a remote section of the hotel without an elevator. The rooms were indeed very charming with wooden ceiling, four poster bed and travertine marble bath. However, what we didn't realize was that the three rooms comprising the ""Traditional Rooms"" section of the hotel share a common wall with a rowdy late-night bar located next door. The ""music"", consisting of an extremely loud and rudimentarily played synthesizer and drum solos, started at 11 PM and continued until 3:40 AM the next morning! This was not the low din of people enjoying themselves. There was an extremely loud and constant BOOM BOOM BOOM with vibrations so jarring you felt as if your bed were inside the bar. The rooms were completely uninhabitable. After a sleepless night we asked at the front desk if we could change rooms and an extremely kind and professional young woman (Georgia) took us under her wing and arranged for us to change rooms, even though the hotel was completely booked. Our new rooms were in the larger ""normal"" section of the hotel with an elevator. Simple but clean and reasonably quiet and the location of Centrum Hotel is ideal. Georgia subsequently proved to be extremely good at her job at the front desk and helped us with tour reservations and restaurant recommendations. On a scale of 1 to 10 Georgia is an eleven! I wish I could say the same for the hotel management who continue to place clients in the ""Traditional Rooms"" section. I understand their need to recoup their investment costs, but by placing clients in these uninhabitable rooms they are severely damaging the hotel's reputation. For that reason I have evaluated Centrum Hotel as Poor. Do NOT under any circumstances let them place you in any of the three rooms of the ""Traditional Rooms"" section!",Centrum Hotel
40,"Hotel Centrum has great rooms and a phenomenal breakfast but the best part about our stay was the staff. Their hospitality was unprecedented. We stayed on the second floor in an Executive Suite. The room was quiet. The only problem with the hotel set-up is that the doors for the rooms do not close quietly. I awoke several times because of the doors from the other guests' rooms shutting closed. Otherwise, our stay was fantastic.",Centrum Hotel

40,Lovely hotel in a great position in the heart of the old town. I stayed in an executive room on the 4th floor (401) - had to walk through a small conference room to get to the rooms which was a bit odd but thankfully they were not in use. Room was very comfortable although the air conditioning/heating unit was a little noisy (even though it was switched off!). Colleagues in other rooms on the other side of the hotel complained about some noise from the surrounding bars but I didn't hear anything! Bathrooms could do with a little updating but the shower was powerful and hot. Staff were friendly and did everything they could to make your stay comfortable - couldn't ask for better. Breakfast was very good but never changed - a slight variation each day would have been nice. Overall a fantastic place to stay if only for its location.,Centrum Hotel

We had some difficulty locating the hotel to start with and the parking is a short walk across the way but once we were checked in everything was very good. We had the executive rooms (105 & 305) which were clean and tidy and very spacious. Possibly the largest bed I have ever seen and the shower, despite looking like it might not be up to much was very powerful and plenty of hot water.

30,"I planned a business trip to Nicosia and, having read all the reviews, I said - what the hell Hilton (where my colleagues stopped), Centrum!!! No doubts, looks like adventure - reserved rooms online and departed to airport. So what Ive got...Merits- Situated in the historical heart of Nicosia, 15 min walk away from Turkish part - yeah - cheap shopping, etc- Very friendly and easy accessible personnel- Renovated common areas, nice reception zone, nice restaurant- Inside the room - close resemblance to my grand mom's kitchen - some obsolete, some old, some hand made, some is not exact fit and manually adjusted but everything is working well & reliable. Wi-fi, no fridge, very nice balcony with nice views of not very nice constructions (room 403), really metallic door key!)))Upppsss- Massive construction goes very close to the hotel, so in the morning I used to wake up from loud sounds of one big thing hitting another and so on.- And the final stroke ... I was attacked by the horde of ants which appeared out of nowhere. As the result I had to practically check and shake out all my luggage and spent the last night tossing and turning, recollecting episodes of National geographic on what kind of infections urban ants might be spreading. I had to admit that when I called to personnel they brought a sort of spray which actually destroyed the trace of ants to the room, at least, till the end of the night... but the chemical smell of it stayed in the room though all night adding to the thing.Well, I cannot say it was wrong experience, I like adventures, probably I will go there again, but match your expectations of the hotel and the character of your trip before you decide on your choice.",Centrum Hotel

We were upgraded from a standard to an executive room which was a nice surprise. The room was spotless, the bed huge and comfortable. A small balcony overlooking the old city was a nice touch. The bathroom was small but clean. A bit of noise from outside overnight but it was the Eid long weekend as well as some Greek celebration on the Sunday morning! Breakfast was self service buffet in the 'Byzantine Restaurant' attached to the hotel. The choices were basic - hot - bacon, eggs (hard boiled or scrambled), baked beans, sausages. Cold - cheese, sliced meats, olives tomato, cucumber etc as well as the standard toast, pastries and cereals. The food was good for both quality and quantity. Great location too!

You cannot flush used toilet paper down the toilet, They want you to place it in the metal can next to the toilet. We discovered this practice in some other Nicosia locations, but not when we were in Larnaca.Our king-sized bed turned out to be two beds placed together.There is a tourist information office within a 5-minute walk from the hotel.The free breakfast offered a good range of food.Unlike in the Larnaca hotel where we stayed earlier, there was no charge for air conditioning or Wifi.Rooms overlooking the street have a better view, but there is often noise from the local establishments.There is an ATM machine less than 100 feet from the hotel. It is the easiest and cheapest way to obtain Euros.",Centrum Hotel

I was told at the reception this was an exception and they would pursue the matter. I have to say that in the times that I have stayed at the hotel I never experienced this problem.Overall a nice place to stay..Eoin,Centrum Hotel

Centrum is located inside pedestrian zone at junction of main walking street, more quiet. Building was nicely renovated and whatever it was in a previous life works well as a hotel. Rooms are not all the same and have little quirks, some with good spacious balconies. Breakfast restaurant located in a grotto-like space, atmospheric. Fast, free internet, ok TV.

40,This hotel is very close to Ledra Street for shops and crossing over to visit the North. The car park is a very short walk away. The room was clean and comfortable but a little noisey because of the UAFA football on TV in the restaurant alongside. The breakfast was excellent with lovely fresh hot croissent and plenty of other hot and cold items. There was free WIFI and apleasant lounge to sit and have a drink.

The period we visited the hotel there were constructions outside so in the early morning it was a bit noisy. The room was very clean,freshly renovated, but the water installation is a bit problematic due to the water quality in the center of the city.

40,"I have stayed in this hotel on many occasions while visiting Nicosia. It has recently been refurbished and new foyer layout and breakfast room are really nice. The staff are particularly friendly and helpful, especially Stefanos and Ahmed. The location is great for exploring both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides of the city, and also for shopping!",Centrum Hotel
40,"While being on vacation in Northern Cyprus I travelled to Nicosia to do some sightseeing and stay one night on the "" greek"" side.Location was in the middle of the centre so very easy to reach all the interesting sites. I had a room on the back, so no noise at all from traffic. Very comfortable room, although I did not book so, it was a superior room I think. AC worked quite well. Free internet in the lobby. I only was not impressed by the breakfast: so so coffee and, what I really dislike the hot dishes (eggs, sausages) were quite cold. But overall a good hotel. !",Centrum Hotel
40,"The hotel is in the old citycenter inside the old city wall area on the ""non occupied"" side. Just 300 meters from the hotel is the check point to go to the far side. You can cross the bufferzone and pass the checkpoint without problems.",Centrum Hotel
50,"I was here in March 2012, off-season, and they knocked 20 euros off their usual 89-euro rate.I had a very large room on the 3rd floor, with huge balcony. Very quiet; no street noise. There was even an ""extra"" little room that I used for exercising. In room wi-fi service, once up and running, is fast and reliable. Hot water took up to eight minutes to activate at certain hours; in the early morning, it was right there.Desk and chair, small refrigerator, in-room safe. Large, welcoming lobby, and separate business center. Breakfast was fantastic--every morning, fruit, choice of pastries, scrambled or hard-boiled eggs, crepes, cereals, yogurt, ham, cheese, three juices.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Stayed there for two nights in January. The location is the best ever in the old part of Nicosia. From there you can visit all major attractions. The price was very good and included breakfast. Internet facilities is a plus for this hotel. The staff are helpful and gave us some good advices. Although the hotel doesnt offer car parking - the public one is not even 2 minutes away, so it is not a problem at all.The only issue we had was that our room was cold. The A/C was on all day, but still it was cold. The weather was unusually cold for Cyrpus - so we took that into consideration.Overall a great offer and worths staying in Centrum.",Centrum Hotel
50,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel in January 2012 on a sightseeing trip.Although it’s primarily a business hotel with high-speed internet access, business workspace and a meeting room, we found the location of the Centrum hotel was absolutely superb for sightseeing both north and south Nicosia old city. It was fairly easy to find and I don’t think the location could be bettered. It’s just inside the old city walls in a small street just off Ledra Street, which is the main shopping area in the old city. At the end of Ledra Street is the pedestrian border crossing into north Nicosia, which is under Turkish control.The Centrum hotel doesn’t have a car park, but don’t let that put you off. There is a large municipal car park just across the road that charges 5 euros for a 10-hour stay. For a city centre hotel it has an impressive reception area with a bar, large screen tv and seating area. Breakfast was fairly basic but very adequate. It was buffet style with hot and cold food including bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, beans, fried bread, croissants, cereals, cold meat and cheese.Our room was spacious and comfortable with a television, tea and coffee making facilities and a hairdryer. There was no bath, just a shower, but it was powerful and there was plenty of hot water. Some of the rooms have a small balcony. We did have wi fi in our room, which was free of charge.If we visit Nicosia again, we would definitely stay in the Centrum and would have no hesitation in recommending it.",Centrum Hotel
40,IAgree with the recent reviews. Maybe the people who found it unsatisfactory were there before the rejuvenation. My only negative note was that the fried bread at breakfast had lost it's crispness.,Centrum Hotel
50,"Well, what more can you ask for? Bang in the center of the city, and fully renovated this year. I highly enjoyed the breakfast which is served in a beautiful terrace outside. Friendly staff helped me with the little details that all travellers need in hotels. Mr.John, the owner, is always there, checking things out discreetly... By the way, there is free internet everywhere...",Centrum Hotel
40,"A new/newly upgraded hotrel in old Nicosia, close to ""everything"" and walking distance to Ledra Street and entry point to the Turkish Cypriot side. All ""sights"" are close. The hotel has large modern rooms, air condition, and large bathrooms. A large reception area with international newspapers, and a friendly staff. Bed and breakfast only, but with a good ""English"" breakfast. Good restaurants/tavernas close.Try to get a room at the rear, otherwise traffic and music noise may disturb yourc sleep.",Centrum Hotel
40,"I had to come to Cyprus to meet possible business partners and did not have to show off in a 4* hotelCentrum provided everything that was needed : better than spartan accommodation, very clean and well kept, all services. The straff was very friendly and willing and able to help with practical matters.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Not any people stay in Nicosia when they travel to Cyprus (no beach...) but it's a mistake. Nicosia is a wonderful place to explore and the Centrum is - as the word says - at the centre of what you want to see, the Old Town, the Walls, the Museums, the border... The staff are very friendly and the level of service is excellent. The hotel is being renovated (but it will be all done in July - it was almost finished when we were there already) and it will also offer rooms in a traditional Cypriot building (at the back of the Hotel). Very charming. Ask for a quote before booking. They might be able to offer you a good deal if you speak to them directly.",Centrum Hotel
50,"We has to attend a 3 day conference at the Holiday Inn city centre, and our company would sponsor just part of the accommodation cost for us. We found hotels nearby that were cheaper and also slightly closer to the Holiday Inn but choose to stay at the Centrum as all 5 of us would rather stay in the same hotel and the Centrum gave us a good deal. An excellent choice, comfortable beds and no need to cross any streets to get to the holiday inn at a better price. The service from reception could of been a bit better and wireless internet should be faster in a business hotel but was no biggie. Parking is a major problem. for anything more than 3 days you would need a proper sized bag and carrying it up about 40 steps would probably be a problem. Otherwise excellent, on freedom square, not noisy, could be used for a shopping weekend if you are into that.",Centrum Hotel
40,I found this place accidentally whilst staying in a rather horrible place in Larnica its right in the shopping area near the green line between the divided city . I was there at the time of the royal wedding and it did have satelight tv .I actually found Cyprus rather run down and very very expensive ie a coffee woulfd usually cost 2- 50 euroes and turn out to be just nescafe.Its very much a city Hotel good also for buses.,Centrum Hotel
40,"An ok 3-star hotel at the center of the town.Has fast internet, ok breakfast and very helpful stuff.Also is the cheapest in the area at the 3-star level.I recommend it.",Centrum Hotel
10,"I stayed in this hotel, after reading good comments. I start believing that many of them must be fake, I mean from hotel related people. First of all the A/C was not functioning OK and I was freezing (I had big difficulty to sleep). Second, this is a very old hotel, very badly preserved, with very basic facilities and dirty. I mean the carpets were never cleaned, the bed sheets had hair and I saw 2 insects (maybe ants, I am not sure). The breakfast quality is extremely low and some food is almost bad. This hotel does not worth paying more than 10 or 20 euro. The only good things, is the location and the polite staff, but this is not enough.",Centrum Hotel
40,"Having travelled to Nicosia in 2010 and having a dissapoimting stay in the Turkish part of the city, opted to stay on the Greek side this time and it was a distinct improvement. The Centrum is ideally located by Ledra Street, and only a few minutes walk from the border crossing.The room was clean and spacious and despite its location quiet. It had obviously been decorated recentlyt, but the bathroom sink was badly cracked - the only negative point in an otherwise enjoyable stay. Staff were extremely friendly and breakfast good.Highly reccommended for anyone staying in Nicosia.",Centrum Hotel
20,"it cost 98 euros and was not worth that at all.The only good thing was that it was right in the centre but hotel was very basic, the room was clean but freezing cold and the bed was uncomfortable and had a very cold atmosphere in the hotel.not worth the money, if was cheaper you wouldnt mind staying",Centrum Hotel
30,"a basic hotel, don't excpect something special. it's in the ledra street near the municipality which is a great location for those who are getting a civil mariage. breakfast is basic, free wifi. you can pass to the north Cyprus part by walking 5 minutes. it's worth doing it specially that you will find all replicas in the other side and a near casino.",Centrum Hotel
30,"I was there for new year's eve last year. Good location but on the other hand very very noisey because the windows do not close properly. Old bathroom and the worst, the breakfast. That was very basic, not hot milk, no real orange juice and not real coffee. We paid 90 € per room and if I compare with the 6 hotels I have been in Cyprus the quality -price ratio is the worst. By the way, my room was older than the one in their web page.",Centrum Hotel
50,"We got there after having great difficulty navigating the very crowded narrow streets of central Nicosia and finding somewhere to park. The receptionist was friendly and helpful, explained how we could park in the nearby public car park for 5 euros a day, and unload our luggage. The room was spacious, with three beds, well equipped - fridge tea things and kettle, excellent shower, nice view of the mountains. The position was excellent - didn't have to use the car at all. Stayed 3 nights. Saw everything we wanted. Beds large and comfortable. Buffet breakfast varied and good. Croissants stale on Monday but better other days. Didn't use the bar etc but it looked fine. Would recommend.",Centrum Hotel

40,"This very popular 3 star hotel, in the old part of the city, is within walking distance of the main crossing point between 'Greek' and 'Turkish' Nicosia.It is therefore the ideal base for visiting both sides of the city.Reception was always helpful and friendly.There were two free internet terminals in the pleasant lobbyMy room was large, clean and comfortable.Breakfast was very good.The hotel is in a quiet street near to lots of shops and restaurants.I could not find any suitable hotel in the tourist part of 'Turkish' Nicosia, but I do strongly recommend a visit there.",Centrum Hotel

10,"- Very noisy, loud noises from the street continue until 4 a.m., could not sleep well- Cockroach in room, otherwise clean- Rooms and public areas basic, with lots of tile-",Centrum Hotel
40,"I was pleasantly surprised how good the hotel was considering its only meant to be 3 star. Everyone who worked there was helpful and friendly. The beds were the most comfortable we had experienced on our travels in Cyprus, so much so that it was hard to get my teenage son out of his. And the rooms were very clean. Breakfast was adequate - it seemed to be the same choice as any other hotel we had been in. The location was great - so close to everything and easy to nip out to get things - post office two minutes away and Ledra Street crossing about 5 minutes. We had a corner room so had a great bigbalcony - really big and it was pleasant to sit out and watch the world go by. Although we were close to Eleftherias Square the hotel did not seem overly noisy - just the usual city sounds. Didn't see any evidence of red light district - as included in one of the reviews. If there was it certainly passed me by. Free wi-fi and internet access was a bonus as I hadn't been able to use by iphone to download data up til then. Passed by some of the other hotels and the Centrum (from the outside) looked by far the best.",Centrum Hotel
10,I was there beginning of semptember as soon as we arived we understand that there where girls comming with men for short stay ( you know what i mean) from the gentlements clubs near the hotel if you are looking for that kind of hotel this is the place to stay SO WE MOVED TO ANOTHER HOTEL CALLED CLEOPATRA WICH WAS OK,Centrum Hotel
50,"We spent 3 nights in Centrum Hotel (friday to monday) because we were getting married in Nicosia. I reserved online and answers per email were quick and, though in few words, complete.We were lucky (and grateful!) to be given the executive suite (we had booked and paid for a double room), which was very nice and spacious, with a cute little balcony overlooking the roofs of the neighboring houses. The bathroom was very clean and the bed was big and with a good mattress. Breakfast was good (buffet-style). The rest of the hotel was very clean as well, and there was free (fast) internet in the lobby. Parking space was available very close by (1,5 min. walk) in a big municipality parking.Aside from the Suite, I'd say the best thing about the hotel is the receptionist Stephanos; very friendly, helpful and, most importantly, knowledgeable.",Centrum Hotel
40,"If you're going to stay in the old part of Nicosia, this is the place. The rooms are simple but clean. The hotel itself is centrally located for exploring the old town and is near various restaurants and shops. The free wi-fi didn't quite make it to my room very well, but there are two computers in the lobby to use. Breakfast was simple but sufficient. Staff was also very nice.Those who've heard about the red light district in Nicosia need not worry. This hotel is not located in its confines, and though there is a ""gentleman's club"" across the way, I never even noticed any traffic going in or out.",Centrum Hotel
40,"I have been to Nicosia before and let me say, honestly, business hotels there are bad. The only thing that made us choose Centrum over any other worldwide chain hotel was the price, fairly lower than average, but since it claimed to have wireless internet in the rooms, we were ok with it.It turned out to be a good surprise, Centrum Hotel has a great location, right in the heart of Nicosia business center, and it was not far from good restaurants and bars too. The wireless internet did work and it was free of charge, like any good business hotel.The rooms are nice, with a tv and a bathroom, nothing fancy, but it does the trick.Don't go expecting any european luxury, because it is a 3-star hotel anyway. Very honest prices, and the staff speaks english clearly.Some rooms don't have minibar, and those who have, don't have any items in them, but there is a convenience store just around the corner of the hotel, very cheap and has cold drinks. There is also a sandwich place in front of the hotel, very good for quick snacks at night.There is no parking for the hotel, in particular, but you can leave your car in a public parking in front of the hotel too. All public parkings are very safe, and the rates were about 2 euros for 4 hours.The location is great for sightseeing tourists and business people, it is right in front of Eleftherias Square, the Venetian Walls (the public parking is inside one) and Macharios Ave. (it booms at night with its cafés and clubs).",Centrum Hotel

The hotel staff were all very friendly and professional, from desk staff to the maids and breakfast staff. I reserved our room by email and on arriving found that we had been upgraded to an Executive Room at no extra cost because all the Standard Rooms were booked. The Executive Rooms are very large, with all the expected amenities plus a balcony, my only reservation would be that there isn't a very good choice of T.V channels in the rooms. The room was clean and homely. Breakfast was fine, plenty of choice and fresh fruit. There is also free internet in the lobby. I would definitely stay here again.",Centrum Hotel

When I first arrived there was a nasty smell in the room which was eventually deodorised. The room was big and comfortable with plenty of storage space. The TV selection was poor. Also breakfast began at 7.30am which is never much good if you have an early start.I would go back again. It's fine, but nothing really grabbed me about this hotel.",Centrum Hotel
