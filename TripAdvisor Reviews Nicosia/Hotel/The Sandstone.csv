20,"We stayed at The Sandstone which we thoroughly enjoyed and decided to stay again. Tried booking but it said the site was closed and came up as The 3 Rooms Boutique which we then realised it is exactly the same hotel but renamed - may have new owners? Booked it and a confirmation came through - guaranteed booking!Then on the 12th September we received an email stating - unfortunately we are having to do urgent bathroom maintenance and the room would not be available, we are looking to close the hotel in order not to disturb guests. Our booking was for the 16th September therefore left us little time to find other accommodation. Thoroughly disappointed. We could not find anywhere to stay that was on comparison to this hotel as we had plans to visit the Northern side for a further two nights which we would lose our money if cancelled. We took the only accommodation we could find but disappointed as this was not of our standard. On our first night we were walking past the 3 Rooms Boutique Hotel and the room we booked had someone staying in it as the balcony doors were ajar and lights on in the room and on our way back the balcony door was closed but lights on. Thus confirming that the room was indeed occupied-absolutely fuming at this. Plus the room was in a superb condition and the bathroom was of a high standard. Just as it shows on the Sandstone site.We honestly think it was a cop out for maybe double booking.Why would they cancel our booking unless they had let it out at a higher price?Think twice before booking just in case it’s cancelled!?!",The Sandstone
50,Absolutely in the thick of things to do in the quaint old part of Nicosia. Try to visit spring or fall when things are not as loud and noisy on the paved street below the place. Book the Green or Wood rooms with the bathroom en suite. Breakfast a bit on the lean and healthy side very continental and light.,The Sandstone
30,Well located in the heart of the city this place is good for a night in townUnfortunately the toilet is not in the room and the street is quite noisy. So maybe more indicated for very young people or one night or two max.To be mention the landlord is very friendly and helpful so absolutely a plus.,The Sandstone
50,"Very nice converted city appartment above an an atmospheric bar in the old city of Nicosia. Modern and light interior design. Every point of (tourist) interest in walking distance. When booking, just be aware that there is no reception (was no problem at all for us, due to good organisation of the owners) and the breakfast consists of a filled fridge/food box.",The Sandstone
50,"We loved the B&B - our room was comfortable and stylish. Our reception was warm and welcoming. The location is convenient for visiting the town. As we left early, we did not have breakfast. Everything worked well, there is nothing that left to be desired. Unfortunately we were able to only stay one night, but will certainly return when in Nicosia!",The Sandstone
50,"We arrived to Nicosia with no expectations whatsoever. But getting off the intercity bus we found ourselves in a lively, colourful city full of friendly locals – and much less annoying tourists. Our guesthouse, The Sandstone was just a stones throw away from the station, in the middle of Nicosia’s busiest, most exciting street: a place where every single building looks like it has a story to tell, filled with fun bars, restaurants lining up international delicacies, and – lucky for us – fast fashion stores (Zara, Pull and Bear, Bershka), home accessories shops (we are addicted to Tiger), and so much more. A piece of good advice: upon your arrival get yourself a local sim card, because in this city getting around without a map is sort of a challenge.",The Sandstone
50,"Great location, great rooms, great service. This was our second time and we will for sure be back. Highly recomendable for couples, right in the old town and pedestrian street area. Lots of shops and night life right outside the door.",The Sandstone
50,"Stayed twice now with friends to show them the sights of Nicosia. Great welcome from the owner on both occasions, e mailed prior to arrival to ask if there was any special requests for our stay. Had both the en suite rooms one at the back & one overlooking the main thoroughfare.Very clean, quirky breakfast box and complimentary wine. Everything you could need for your stay. Be aware that the room on the front can be noisy but if you visit at the weekend as we did you have to expect noise which just added to the atmosphere.Would definitely stay again.",The Sandstone
50,"We planned on staying in our usual hotel and then saw this advertised. It is in a great place within the old city, it is in the pedestrianised area, running parallel with Ledra Street. Yiannis kept in touch with us to ensure we would find it easy enough and we did, loved the idea of being in the cafe/restaurant arcade behind the green door!!! Sounds very mystique and inviting. The room was very clean and the bathroom very modern, the room was carpeted which gave it a luxury feel. We had a breakfast box which had adequate things in, cheese, crackers, nuts, muesli, yoghurt, water, orange juice and all refilled for our next day. Plus a nice cold bottle of wine which we had sat on the balcony, very enjoyable stay and we will definitely stay again. This is a really lovely place to stay and met all our needs.......",The Sandstone
50,Booked the two ensuite rooms had another enjoyable visit with friends who were staying with us from the UK. The entire stay was faultless bed very comfy hot shower in a lovely bathroom. Toiletries provided including a bottle of free wine nibbles & a breakfast box. All very modern hidden away but worth the discovery. A little street noise (sat night ) from balcony room but other ensuite isn't street facing so seemed quieter. 4stars from us. Thank you,The Sandstone
50,"Yiannis, the owner, contacted us before we set off to make sure we had the directions to the hotel as it's in a pedestrian area and so the taxi driver would have to drop us nearby and not outside. He checked in with us again when we arrived at the airport to make sure he was around when we arrived. We followed the directions and map and after minor initial confusion, we quickly made our way along the narrow cobbled street filled with people sitting out at tables and in wine bars. Just as we stopped to check the street number, Yiannis approached us and we were very close to the entrance to the Sandstone. There's an alley lined with tables at a very popular restaurant and the green door which leads into a tiny entrance hall and polished wooden stairs up to the rooms.It's a terrific location if, like us, you like to be in the midst of the hustle and bustle and don't mind the noise from sometimes noisy revellers. There are three bedrooms and a dining room on the first floor, with balconies or windows overlooking the street. Ours was a generous sized room with quirky furnishings - lampshades at jaunty angles, cupboard / wardrobe with carefully curated wooded shoe stretchers, cushions etc. The shower room was spotless and spacious with a large walk in shower.Breakfast is a do it yourself offering which again suited us well. Everything is in the fridge - milk, butter, cheese etc and there's a basket with crackers, cereal and nuts. He also left us a complimentary bottle of wine which was a welcoming touch. Fruit and muffins are in the dining room if you want them.The TV has a good selection of channels in English and the room has A/C. Checkout is midday, so there was no rush and Yiannis told us just to leave the keys in the box by the front door if he wasn't there when we left. In fact we bumped into him again just after we'd left and he was again very pleasant and hoped we'd enjoyed our stay.",The Sandstone
50,This is a nice old house in the very heart of Nicosia. The room with balcony has tasteful interior design. Only disadvantage is the noise in the night which we were kindly warned when booking at Sandstone but it is worth of it :) Breakfast basket is provided and you can enjoy it while sitting on the small balcony.,The Sandstone
50,"The entrance is via a side door in an arcade. No on site staff but quick attendance and helpful. Rooms above shops reached by stairs. No lift. Our room was with balcony which had no table. Sleeping room with one armchair, two slatted chairs, cupboard in which is small fridge and TV on top. The TV reported ""No signal"" despite our best efforts. Bathroom adjoining sleeping room. Modern and clean. Shower valve a bit temperamental. A dining table and chairs are in a common,spacious area where there were cakes and fruit for decoration or consumption. The place is quaint, stylish and relatively luxurious. Sumptuous bed. In our room, the most expensive, every conceivable need had been met. A box of breakfast and extra snacks of good quality, coffee/tea making facilities, much in the fridge, wine, disposable slippers toiletries in abundance. All included. No room fridge bill. High ceilings show an old building, tastefully converted by retaining some original features. The unseen owners go out of their way to provide very well for guests. Note that this is not a flat so no cooking facilities. Sandstone receives some of the best reviews on certain booking sites and that may be slightly over the top. However, it is very good accommodation at a fair price on the day (80Euros).",The Sandstone
50,"We've stayed in quite a few different places in Nicosia and this was, by far, the best one. Lovely clean simple room. Amazingly comfortable bed. Very helpful owner. In addition the location was perfect and the rooms are in a lovely old traditional building.",The Sandstone
50,"After negotiating the challenging one way system of Nicosia this boutique hotel is very well situated at the heart of the city. Easy access to Ledra Street and a wealth of good quality restaurants around. We booked a room with an en-suite and is spacious, clean and well appointed. Easy walking distance to the border. It's located within the city walls so parking is best outside the walls as it is less expensive. Car parks inside are 1 Euro per hour with a max of 3 hours allowed. Parking outside is 5 euros per day and cars can be left for as long as you need. The hotel front door is located in an atrium which has a coffee bar and a restaurant, but not linked to the hotel. Supplies are provided for breakfast, with fresh pastries provided in a communal dining area. Can't wait to go back and explore Nicosia and use this hotel as a good base. We stayed in March but was still full, I would assume that this hotel gets booked up quickly in the summer.",The Sandstone
40,Beautifully appointed rooms very clean & modern. The bathroom was fantastic very powerful shower. All the little touches made a big difference to our short stay. The bed & pillows along with the linen made for a comfortable bed. Had a few problems with street noise both with street cleaning & deliveries from 6am but we did stay on a Friday night so expected noise from the surrounding bars.Breakfast was different than expected it came in a wooden box ( crackers/ cheese/ butter/ orange juice along with 2 yoghurts in fridge.Would highly recommend as its in the heart of everything takes a bit of finding but it's a delight when you do. Just take ear plugs at the weekend 😀,The Sandstone
50,"This is a lovely place - beautiful rooms in an old-style building. It's above a bar, but noise didn't seep through, and it has a nice lounge area with a big table. But most of all, wonderful people running it.",The Sandstone
50,"I was recommended the Sandstone by a family member to stay at and I'm so pleased that we did. Great location in the heart of Nicosia with easy walking distance to lots of great places to eat and drink. The apartment was decorated beautifully inside and everything done to the highest quality. The whole place was full of great little touches e.g a complimentary bottle of wine. For me the best part of it was probably the owner Max! He was very welcoming, letting us check in and out early with no charges and really went out of his way to make us feel welcome. He was full off useful information about things to do and see in the city- we followed all of his recommendations and weere pleased with them all.On second thoughts the best part of it was the breakfast (sorry Max!). It was probably the best breakfast I've ever had! It quite literally had everything you could possibly want... and then some more on top!My main piece of advice would be for those using hire cars. If you park in the carpark just to the outside of the city walls it about a 5 minute walk to the Sandstone. It's cheap and I think easier than trying to park within the city walls. Also the Sandstone is quite difficult to find. It is on one of the main shopping streets in the town, almost directly behind Subway. There is a little cafe/ restaurant there with tables and seating in a walkway connnecting two streets- the big green door there is the one you want!!!",The Sandstone
50,"The place is an beautiful old but very well kept building, right in the beautiful old city of Nicosia. Owner is a young English man, that spent about an hour(!) each morning in guiding us through all of our stay in Nicosia- where to eat, where to park the car for free, where NOT to go... . He's an interior designer in profession so the place is so wonderfully designed. The breakfasts were also just great. It's really hard to anything that was bad or wrong with this whole experience - and we stayed there for 4 nights which is quite a long stay, so if there would have been anything bad to say, we probably would have found it.. Extra recommended.",The Sandstone
50,This is a small very tasteful hotel with a very lovely charm in the old city of Nikosia. The owner makes your stay unforgettable and the breakfast is insane! Don't miss this!!There is nothing that could be done better! Great experience.,The Sandstone
50,"I wanted to surprise my husband for his birthday and i booked a night in Nicosia in this beautiful hotel!!! So cozy, super duper clean , delicate decoration and the hospitality was superb ! Breakfast was delicious ( for the breakfast lovers you will remember my words)!Huge plus for this Gem(!) is the location! Is located on Onasagorou street where you can find a zillion bistros, cafes, restaurants, tavernas and pubs!! You just through your car on a parking lot and you go around on foot! Behind Onasagorou street is the shopping street Ledras with shops and all goods you need for a great shopping therapy,",The Sandstone
50,"This 100 year old property has been sympathetically renovated to a very high standard. It is situated in the centre of historic Nicosia which makes it excellent for exploring the city on foot. Despite its central location, it is very peaceful and Max, the host goes at great lenghs to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Highly recommended!",The Sandstone
50,"I stayed for one night at the Sandstone and it was amazing. The place is nicely located in the center, It is nice and clean and Max is such a friendly and dedicated host. Definitely recommendable to stay! Oh and don't miss breakfast, it's great.",The Sandstone
50,"This B&B is a real gem, situated in the centre of Old Nicosia in a restored old stone house-apartment, overlooking a pedestrian mall. Very comfortable room, cosy even on a cold winter's night. Owner very friendly. Breakfast was a healthy spread. One of the nicest places we stayed in Cyprus.",The Sandstone
50,Max looks after you informs you of what to do where eat etc is chef maid & office person in one Great guy This place is in the heart of the Old Town you need to park in local council parking area which is reasonably close Its not easiest to find but ask at the café underneath the lovely green & colored balcony plants no 16 A little noisy from street but what do you expect the furniture & all items are quality including the bed Totally recommend this place book early & say hi to Max,The Sandstone
50,"We had a wonderful 6 nights at the Sandstone in October. (Sorry for the tardy posting - not a reflection on the hotel) Max's hospitality was the perfect mix of friendliness and courtesy. We cannot recommend it more highly. The breakfasts offered something for everyone with a spread including home made fruit tarts, jams, granola, fresh fruit; you name it. The rooms are beautifully designed with simple but striking fittings. It's right in the middle of the pedestrian precinct so we could sit on the balcony and watch the world go by or close the triple glazing to sleep quietly. We'll be back when I return to work and we wouldn't stay anywhere else.Graham and Sue",The Sandstone
50,Yet again this place is second to none. This is our second time of staying and Max deserves 10 gold stars it is just home from home. The breakfast is to die for! Look forward to staying again. Thank you Max.,The Sandstone
50,"I can only reiterate what other reviewers have said about this gorgeous little hotel. Max, as others have said, kindly offered to meet us and find us a carpark to make finding The Sandstone easier but we like adventure and found our way through a little courtyard to a big green door. It feels hidden, exclusive and almost secretive but architecturally this building is gorgeous and has a romantic feel.Max welcomed us and showed to us to a stunning room with beautiful high ceilings, a gorgeous balcony that looks out over the old streets below and a huge, modern bathroom. We even got a complimentary bottle of wine.Max gave us a map and recommended several bars and restaurants in the area. Unfortunately I had to be up and out very early in the morning (before breakfast) and he offered to provide grub for me. The breakfast is laid out beautifully with delicious meats, cheeses, breads, fruits, cereals and so on. It was fresh, plentiful and really tasty.My husband had an issue with a local car park and fortunately, Max speaks Greek and essentially sorted it out for us and showed us to a car park that was much cheaper.Overall, for us this was perfect. it was centrally located close to shops, bars and restaurants. The building is absolutely stunning and the interior is bright, modern and beautiful. Breakfast is fantastic but mostly the customer service is exceptional and nothing ever feels like too much. My husband and I will absolutely return and would recommend The Sandstone to anyone travelling to Nicosia.",The Sandstone
50,"After reading the enthusiastic recommendations in Trip Adviser, we stayed here on a flying visit to Nicosia for one night. Thanks to the great lengths Max went to in offering us advice about sightseeing, we really made the most of our time. The room was very comfortable, offering everything we needed, and the building had been modernised with great skill and style. The Sandstone is very centrally located, just a short walk from the bus station and in the middle of a pedestrianised area containing many good shops and restaurants. The breakfast was delicious and the most beautifully presented we have ever seen. We were very impressed by the care and thoroughness Max devoted to all aspects of our stay.",The Sandstone
50,"I have never stayed in such a nice place. Its right in the city center, close to all restaurants bars and cafes.Very clean, old style but with modern details!Max was very friendly and helpful!The breakfast was very nice served and delicious.I recommend this place with no doubt!I am definitely staying there the next time i visit nicosia!!",The Sandstone
50,"Spent 2 nights at the Sandstone and would recommend the experience to anyone who wants something very different. The building and rooms have been restored and decorated with passion and great attention to detail. But a home from home with the warm welcome and contact with the host Max. Great, healthy breakfast and place to have time to meet people and chat.",The Sandstone
50,"We spent just one night and it was excellent, perfectly situated in the best street of Nicosia, gorgeous house, a bottle of win as gift, a wonderful breakfast and all of these with an extreme kindness of the owner ! if u visit Nicosia, dont hesitate, go to the Sandstone !",The Sandstone
50,"We can only endorse what other reviewers have expressed so fully. Our host, Max, could not have been more helpful and charming. Arriving at Nicosia by car, we would have got hopelessly lost if he had not met us, directed us to a well- placed (and cheap!) car park and accompanied us to the house.Everything about the property, our room, the fittings, the linen, the location, the breakfast were fantastic and we cannot rate them highly enough.",The Sandstone
50,"Best B&B ever. Casual, friendly owners, great friendly interior, very clean and on top location. I have been there many times, Sandstone always gave me the opportunity to be 100% flexible with my working and leisure hours. And being really friendly with owners I felt like at home. My No1 place to stay in Nicosia.",The Sandstone
50,"At the moment of writing, this place has only Excellent reviews and after having stayed 2 nights in The Sandstone, we can totally understand why.Max is an incredible host - he contacted us before we even arrived to offer help if we get lost in Nicosia's tiny one-way streets, and from the moment we walked in he took great care of us, providing all the local guidance and tips you could think of. It felt more like visiting a distant relative or a friend than visiting a B&B. We wished we had more time in Nicosia as even just sitting and chatting to him about life and travels and everything else during breakfast is an experience of its own.The place itself is absolutely lovely - you can feel it's been redecorated not long ago, everything is squeaky clean but also feels homely. On arrival we found a bottle of (delicious) wine and some water in the fridge, and as others said, breakfast is a work of art.Location is also fantastic, in the center of the old town, walkable to everything you might want to see (including the border with Turkey), close to countless cutesy cafes and incredible value restaurants. The room with the balcony which we had overlooks the main pedestrian street with cafes - lovely to watch the world go by with a glass of the provided wine in hand :), but very peaceful and quiet once the balcony door was closed, so no problem sleeping.The only ""problem"" with the place is that it's very small so you'd better be quick to book! :)",The Sandstone
50,"Having booked and had to rearrange Max could not have been more helpful and friendly.As other reviewers have said its not easy to find, but Max had one of the chaps at a restaurant below watching and the next thing is Max approached me in the street when i was lost! Great Service!The whole place was spotless and clean,fully equipped with things you expect in a 5 *! The bed was great and about the best hot water shower ive had in years. The little touches were what made it, it was all done so simply but tastefullyBut it was Max that really made it, so helpful and nice, nothing was too much trouble. Even thought it was right in the old town, there was little noise from outside which was a bonus.I will always use the sandstone and have already booked more visits this year.",The Sandstone
50,"The Sandstone is a world away from the bland, uncomfortable corporate chain hotels that abound in most cities, and in particular Nicosia.Max has created a beautiful, tranquil and welcoming guesthouse in the pedestrian heart of the city. Hospitality and quality, from the beds to the breakfast.The lack of a rooftop swimming pool and helipad might inconvenience some guests, but I am sure Max is working on it!",The Sandstone
50,"This accommodation was beyond expectation! The location, in the old city, is ideal since any place can easily be reached walking. The house itself, and the rooms, are pretty and nicely decorated, whilst having all the comfort needed. The breakfast is not only excellent, but is presented as a truly "" piece of art"" by the owner being himself an artist.Finally, the place is quiet and the host most welcoming; in one word, you just feel like visiting a great friend , with good tastes, and happy to have you in his place! ( which is not so common after all!)",The Sandstone
50,"My dad and I visited Nicosia for the Wales match Cyprus . First time visitors to this exciting up and coming location. In the heart of the main vibrant shopping and leisure area. Max the owner was simply the best host he was a different class . Probably one of the best breakfasts we have had. He gave us some good tips for local places to eat. We found a great bar called brewfellas which was our base for the trip!! The room was spacious, spotlessly clean with great bathroom . All in all a great place to stay . Thanks max for a great trip !!",The Sandstone
50,"Located on the main street of the old city, and a minutes walk from the bus station, this lovely place is somehow hidden between the bars, restaurants and shops around it.It's a renovated old building you can see they've put great effort on the interior design and decor, and the place looks superb - a real top-notch boutique hotel, in a very affordable price.Max, the owner, was welcoming and chatty, gave us nice recommendations for site seeing etc.The breakfast was delicious and so beautifully setup. The bed was awesome and everything was just in place. Fabulous!Bottom line: the perfect place to stay.",The Sandstone
50,"Travellers must note that this is a bed and breakfast and not a hotel, so do not expect the daily room cleaning or a manned reception counter. Instead, guests will find a most welcoming host, who designed the rooms himself, prepares the breakfast lovingly and takes time to sit down with guests at breakfast to interact with them.The room I stayed in was beautiful. The owner, Max, designed and decorated the rooms. Bed was luxuriously comfortable, bedroom and en-suite shower and toilet was clean. Especially loved the rain shower. Towels and toiletries were provided so don't worry if you did not pack your shampoo and shower foam. Max was thoughtful enough to provide a bottle of water and wine in the bar fridge.Best part about the stay was the breakfast. What is a bed and breakfast if it doesn't provide a good breakfast? Max laid out a scrumptious spread every morning. Bread, pastries, ham, fruits, various jams, cereal, yogurt and freshly brewed coffee and tea. Max loves to interact with his guests, so breakfast is always a lively affair interacting with hi, and the other guests who are staying in the Sandstone.The Sandstone is located in the heart of Nicosia. The streets below are crowded with people eating and drinking in cafes. It is also a few minutes walk away from the bus terminal. I stayed in the room without a balcony (The Book Room), so it was quiet and calm; I couldn't hear any street sounds.Even though it isn't a hotel, guests can call Max for help should they encounter any emergencies while traveling around Cyprus.Max was the perfect host, would definitely recommend anyone looking for a place to stay in Nicosia.",The Sandstone
50,"Absolutely fantastic boutique hotel in the center of Nicosia.The hotel is beautifully decorated and very well kept. This classic building in the center of Cyprus has been turned into a modern funky home away from home. The spacious room has a lovely balcony overlooking the street below, a comfortable bed with a snugly duvet, fluffy towels and a huge bathroom with wooden floors!The hotel owner Max is very warm, friendly and always ready to help. The most memorable part of our stay was the breakfast prepared by Max every morning! This delicious spread put together from local ingredients is not to be missed.This hotel is a must stay if you are in Nicosia.",The Sandstone
50,"From the warm and friendly welcome, to the eclectic mix of classic and modern, to the fantastic buffet breakfast - simply the best. In a pedestrian area, close to bars, cafe and restaurants.Recommend to all.",The Sandstone
50,"After a warm welcome by the hotel owner Max, we set foot in this lovely authentic building right in the heart of Nicosia. From the entry right up towards the room everything was taking care of in detail. A beautiful mix between the classic character of the building and new age trendy furniture.(It shows that Max has a background as an interior designer.)After a lovely night in the capital we woke up to one off the best setup breakfasts we have every laid eyes on. It was divine...Beautiful, peaceful, mesmerising experience! Kudos to our host... keep up the good work!We'll be back. For sure!xx Tom & Despo",The Sandstone
50,"I was so thoroughly sold on the Sandstone I was ready to move in permanently (if only I didn't have to come back to work and reality...).In all seriousness, Max and Diony are warm, generous and interesting hosts. They clearly care greatly about the guesthouse and each of their guests, and go above and beyond to tailor the stay to your own interests. Despite being readily available, they are never intrusive of your space or time.The rooms are renovated very tastefully, and a stay here feels like a stay in an charming Parisian apartment with the most modern of facilities (air conditioning, lovely bathrooms etc). The handmade soaps are a special touch.Despite being central, I never found the apartment noisy, and the Balcony room is a sneakily delightful place to people-watch over the street.Just one word of warning: come to breakfast hungry, as the buffet is extensive and generous. They are also very flexible and managed to provide a gluten-free, lactose-free meal at very short notice (thank you again!).A stay here will really make your trip to Nicosia something special.",The Sandstone
50,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Sandstone and wish we had stayed longer. We toured Cyprus staying in most places 1 - 2 nights. The Sandstone was a breath of fresh air compared to other accommodation options on the island - no plastic mattress protector, nice linen, comfortable mattress, fluffy towels, broad range of breakfast options but at a similar room rate. We didn't realise how much we had missed these elsewhere!As other reviewers have said - Max is the perfect host. We got frustrated by the traffic in Nicosia and ditched the car on arrival. Max came with us to find the car and a carpark to leave it in overnight.Really central location, in a pedestrianised area in the middle of town. Close to bars and restaurants.Couldn't recommend it enough.",The Sandstone
50,"We had a lovely time at Sandstone. The room was very tastefully decorated, everything was very clean. Even though the hotel is in the center of nicosia our room was not noisy. The breakfast was also lovely. I can only agree with the other reviews. Max is so friendly and so helpful! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a unique place to stay.",The Sandstone
50,"I really enjoyed staying in The Sandstone these last 2 days! The building is unique in its kind, the décor is beautiful, the breakfast wonderful, Max, our host, was kind and welcoming and Old Nicosia is very charming and picturesque!",The Sandstone
50,"This place is really worth visiting and staying at. Max, the owner, is very friendly and helpful. The place has a homey atmosphere, rooms are very nicely furnished and decorated. Ideal location and very good breakfast.",The Sandstone
50,"Sandstone is amazing. You feel right at home with unique look of the hotel stationed in the heart of Nicosia, very comfortable beds and the best and most beautiful breakfast I have seen and tasted in my life. If you are in Nicosia, this is the place to be.",The Sandstone
50,"It is the most beautiful place to stay in Nicosia! The location is great. Max is an exampler of hospitality! Great concept, great people! The decoration of the rooms is unique, the breakfast is an experience with fine goods but most all the manner of the owner!Anastasia",The Sandstone
50,"A very stylish and beautiful place! A comfortable, clean, nicely decorated room with a beautiful bathroom. Delicious and nicely arranged breakfast. Max was very friendly and helpful as well.It was a wonderful place to stay at!..",The Sandstone
50,"I now live in Cyprus and my search was for a special place to stay when I visit Nicosia. The quote ""How can one say in words what the eye the ear and the heart tell you is sublime"" was never more true than when applied to The Sandstone. Max and Diony have put their heart into creating The Sandstone and continue to apply that approach to EVERYTHING they do. It is scrupulously clean, uncluttered and the breakfasts are unique. I would concur with all that my fellow reviewers have to say. Max is the ultimate host but it is a friend you leave behind, together with a wish to return.",The Sandstone
50,"This small ""home"" directly in the old town from Nicosia is unbelievable. It is the perfect starting position to explore Nicosia and after the great and amazing breakfast what Max offered started the day in the best way. Thank you very much again Max and we will see us in October.",The Sandstone
50,"This was a wonderful find in old town Nicosia. The hotel is a converted historic building with beautiful architecture and interior decoration. The owners Max and Diony are very hospitable and kind. Our flight arrived late in the evening and I was afraid the taxi would not find it. Max made sure there was a taxi waiting for us at the bus stop and then waited for us near the hotel so they could help us with the baggage and directions. The room is spacious, beautiful decorations, and the bathroom is exceptional.The most important advantage for the place is actually Max. He was super helpful, attentive, friendly. He suggested a wonderful dinner spot for us that was not in the middle of the touristy area and then he drew a map to show us how to get there.Breakfast is really fresh and tasty. Pictures attached.I really recommend this place.Only thing is that it might get a bit noisy with music from the restaurant/bars area downstairs but it did not bother us. Beds are comfy and internet is very good.",The Sandstone
50,"In the heart of Nicosia old town, The Sandstone was a perfect base to explore and, within the medieval Venetian walls, experience Nicosia’s burgeoning revitalised atmosphere, whose backdrop is the green line of a divided city- living history in the raw. Max and Diony's combined creative backgrounds are evident in every detail of this sandstone conversion where inventive interior design combines with the traditional integrity of a building seamlessly. The Sandstone spans the vibrant café society developing in the streets below and joining it in the evening will really make the most of your stay. We loved the place and the great buffet breakfast provided by Max and his local knowledge and recommendations were a welcome bonus.",The Sandstone
50,"This place is a very beautiful spot in Nicosia! I can imagine many many reasons to come and stop here. We are a small family, spending our last night in Cyprus after 3 years and found here a very nice place with an amazing interiour and the probably best breakfast you can have in Nicosia. Max was a great host, he even got a highseat for our little one! You can have everything here I think. Relax at Max´place and afterwards pop into the day- and nightlife of Nicosia with it´s nice restaurants, coffees and bars around. I can warmly recommend this place and I am looking forward to staying in more places of Max and Diony around the island soon!",The Sandstone
50,"Cyprus is one of my favourite places on the planet and whenever I am in Nicosia this is my go to place. The beauty of the interior is matched by the wonderful ambiance from below.Its location is so central to everything that it makes a perfect jumping off base and the owners are helpful and honest about where to eat, drink and/or be merry.I love it there and you will too. I promise.",The Sandstone
50,"It is in the center of Nicosia, so great location and my room was clean and tidy, with great fresh decor. The breakfast had a wide choice and it was all fresh, great start a day of exploring! Max is the guy who runs the B&B and he was really friendly, he helped me with places to eat and where to go. Close to lots of shops and restaurants. I felt very welcome and enjoyed my stay here, it was all made easy.",The Sandstone

The breakfasts were amazing, the host had put a lot of thought into them.The location was perfect, right in the heart of old town Nicosia, which is a beautiful place to explore, everything is on your doorstep.The hosts were welcoming and warm, if we ever get a chance to return to Cyprus, we will definitely be stopping here again!",The Sandstone
50,"My sister and I stayed in this gorgeous little gem a few months ago, totally hidden away in the centre of Nicosia. It felt like we were staying in a friend's home rather than a B&B, except possibly more effort went into breakfast than normal! Max and Diony are great hosts and had a lot to offer in terms of information about Nicosia and advice on the best ways to get around. My next trip to Cyprus will definitely entail a stay at the Sandstone!",The Sandstone
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Sandstone as a birthday treat! Located in the heart of Nicosia, this adorable Bn'B was exceptional! Apart from the gorgeous decor, it was clean, cosy and comfortable. Our room was spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. There was also a cute little balcony overlooking the often busy Onasagourou street below us. Mini fridge, tv, coffee, tea and wine were a bonus!Max was extremely friendly and helpful! He even showed us to a nearby second hand furniture shop in the old town where we pottered around to see what treasures we could find!We woke up to a breakfast that definitely went a step above any we'd had before in other small hotels and Bn'Bs. Beautifully arranged in the dinning room, it included fresh fruit, yoghurt, croissants, different cheeses, meats cereals and a selection of jams. All delicious! You can tell a lot of care went into it! This place is well worth a visit.",The Sandstone
50,"A beautiful sandstone house in the old city centre, gorgeously decorated, footsteps away from some of the most eclectic cafes, restaurants, bars and shops in town. By far and away, the best place to stay in Nicosia!",The Sandstone
50,"Both rooms in the Sandstone are beautiful; modern with old-world elements, in keeping with the traditional house they are in. Max and Diony looked after us beautifully serving us amazing breakfasts. The location, in the centre of old Nicosia means there is a great buzz with shops, cafes and restaurants just yards away. This is not a location for peace and quiet! Rather it would suite young people, professionals and people looking for a fun place to stay. I highly recommend and will visit again!",The Sandstone
50,"My wife and I wanted a quick getaway for the weekend to break up the normal day to day, so we booked a weekend stay at ""The Sandstone"".Could not have been happier, the atmosphere was amazing, cozy & warm, Breakfast was a treat.Max & Diony were the perfect hosts.My only note is that since its in the city center expect to hear the hustle and bustle of an active nightlife happening outside in the evening, other than that would recommend and would go again.",The Sandstone
50,"Awesome boutique B&B and amazing hospitality in the very centre of the old town of Nicosia within the medieval Venetian walls. Max and Diony are very hospitable and know Nicosia like the back of their hand. The breakfast beats any other one available in town and the rooms are super comfy and make you feel nostalgic for the Cyprus yesteryear. Perfect for romantic or fun getaways, business/research trips or just an exploratory walk around the ancient history and modern vibes of the town. Love it!",The Sandstone
