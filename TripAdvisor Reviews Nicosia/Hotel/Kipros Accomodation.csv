The owners always go that extra mile to provide a great service at anytime.everything you need is at close range and it's location is ideal, for a stroll in the centre. I have stayed here many times and it gets better every time. I would highly recommend it to all,.. suited for families, solo travellers and others. Clean spacious room with a very trational design that makes the hotel even more welcoming. The decor at the reception area immediately gives you a nice warm feeling. Easy check in process and overall the best choice in the city",Kipros Accomodation
50,"This is a small family hotel, ran by a father and daughter. The two of them and the lovely housekeeper are amazing hosts and look after their guests exceptionally well. The accommodation is quirky, interesting and definitely not something we have seen before. The common areas were very clean and our room was sanitised everyday with fresh towels and bed linen provided daily. There is a beautiful terrace on the top floor, which is perfect for resting, having a drink or just enjoying the lovely weather. The location of the hotel is simply perfect, as it is situated in the centre of the old town. All the historical sights, museums and restaurants are less than ten minutes walking distance away from the hotel. Another positive side is that the main bus station is just in 3 mins…",Kipros Accomodation
30,"Good value for money for one night. A great location - very close to Ledra street. Friendly staff in the morning. Very affordable - only €40 per night. The man who checked us in after hours spoke about 3 words to us the whole time - not very friendly or welcoming. Room smelt quite bad of smoke, and someone across the hall was playing heavy metal music all night - we had to turn the AC right up to block out the noise. Very small bathroom - however for the price and location it was good value for money - just not for everyone.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"Kipros Accommodation is a truly fantastic place to stay in Nicosia. We stayed 2 nights. The whole place has very beautiful decor. It’s got all the basics, kettle, hairdryer and is clean and comfortable. The young lady on reception is delightful and very helpful. It’s minutes from the bus station and minutes from Ledra Street with its shopping, cafes, bars, restaurants and of course the border into the Turkish side. I can not recommend Kipros enough and I would strongly recommend to family and friends who might be visiting Nicosia. We loved it.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"What an absolute pleasure To have stayed here in this Family run business, the rooms are clean tidy and it’s very unique style of house. Absolutely central for everywhere two minutes to the main street and across the border. Would not give it a second thought to pick again I’m going to bring my family up here in September and recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in Nicosia. Thank you and see you soon xx",Kipros Accomodation

30,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The location I felt was superb, the room was clean and touched up on a daily basis. I feel the staff could have been more helpful as we were left hanging in the lobby a couple of times and each day there was work being done on the place and we didn't get a heads up and at times we were woken up to work being done. Overall I would use this hotel again. Enjoy it.",Kipros Accomodation
10,"Kipros never officially canceled my reservation through Agoda. When I contacted them to let them know that I would be arriving late, they asked for my phone number to call me at home and say that they canceled the reservation because ""Turkish people usually don't show"". I am flying in from Istanbul, but am not Turkish. More importantly, their guessing my nationality should not have mattered. They provided no solutions to fix the problem. 10 hours before I land late in the evening with no accommodation.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"We stayed at kipros Accomodation for 1 night. Our stay at kipros was very good from start until the check out. The lady at reception was very polite and helpful, as she let us store our luggage there for a few hours after the check out. Our room was clean, with a clean toilet/bath, toiletries, good WIFI and heating/AC. It has a terrace on the top floor for fresh air.It's located 5 minutes walk from Solomou square bus station where buses to/from other cities arrive/depart. Also, Kipros Accomodation is just 5 minutes away from Nicosia's famous ""Ledra street"" & it's pedestrian crossing to the north Cyprus (Turkish side).THANK YOU KIPROS ACCOMODATION!!",Kipros Accomodation
30,"First of all, there is no lie. Room looks just as you see online. Its good! Good wifi, super central location, super cheep, super friendly owners. I assume, it would be way more perfect in summer. In winter rooms are very damp, and cold, but just like every house in Cyprus, with no heating system (however, there is airco, and it heats, drys, your room, quickly!) Toilets are small, but, this is a budget hotel, so I totally understand. My largest issue was cleaning services :) Believe me, its totally different from many coments - little cleaning ladies are just obsessed adout changing your towels, and making beds. No matter what day of the week, they will start aroud 9 and will go till 12: smashing doors, moving furniture, rustle plastic bags, and the worst thing - shouting something to each other. But in result, its clean :), as clean as simple hotel room can be!",Kipros Accomodation
50,"This a real treasure, full of character. Close to Ledra Street and crossing to Turkish Nicosia.Breakfast is freshly cooked and plentiful. A real taste of Cypriot hospitality. Nothing was too much trouble.",Kipros Accomodation
20,This is an old building with very old furniture and windows. No lights in the bathroom. In front of a high traffic small road and for that extremely noisy. Including or especially during the night. It is ok only if you have to spend a night in the center.,Kipros Accomodation
20,"The hotel has a good location just 5 minits from ledra street and the bed sheets were clean, that all positive at this property.Negativ- the mattress was not a real one( very hard and hot to slip on), the bathroom was really dirty not sanitized at all never, everywhere in the room and bathroom full of here- not ours, noisy- we couldn’t sleep at all, the furniture old and dated, just the mirror was nice in the room, internet not working well, you could here the noise from other rooms.I have to admit it was cheap-37 euro but still i expect a clean room and clean bathroom.... and a real matress.I don’t recommend this place.",Kipros Accomodation
30,"Just 5 minutes from bus station (where you can go to Larnaca or Pahpos) and near city center and main street Ledra.Design of interior is represant the old Cypros staff. Room was clean and normal size with little bath on the second floor.To be honest, the staff isnt so friendly as i wish.Breakfast is small and cost 5 euro.Accept only cash for room and breakfast.Very good for staying, but average for staff.",Kipros Accomodation
10,The bathroom was ridiculously small so you cannot even go to toilet. The room was never cleaned and the noise coming from outside was inbearable. This is for room 4. It is conveniently situated by the coty centre,Kipros Accomodation
30,"The location could not have been better for exploring Nicosia! 5 minutes from the border, 3 minutes from the bus station, lots of bars and restaurants close by! There is a lovely roof terrace to soak up the sunshine after a day of exploring.As the hotel is opposite a bar, be warned that on a Saturday night it is very noisy!!! Also slightly frustratingly the balcony in the room didn’t open and when we asked for some help the staff again got very defensive. Instead of simply apologising and explaining it could not be opened they got annoyed that we had asked and were quite aggressive. A situation that could have be handled much better!",Kipros Accomodation
30,"Excellent location - for the bus station, exploring Nicosia, and crossing the green line. The rooms are broadly OK, and reasonably well equipped. Ours felt a bit gloomy and damp, and had a few minor issues. Did not see much of the staff - seemed a bit distant. Downstairs area is empty a lot of the time. Price is good value. 2-3 nights a good period of time to stay.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"Stayed here for 1 night for hubby's birthday - a night in the city we live in quiet Polis :) Clean comfortable rooms, helpful host (Marina), Parked right outside (had reserved a parking place but didn't expect it to right outside). Hot showers, good breakfast, comfortable bed. Only a few minutes walk from all the key landmarks in the old city. It's not luxurious, but when you only spend a few hours in the room, why pay more? I will certainly stay there again next time I visit Nicosia :)",Kipros Accomodation
40,"Small hotel with 10 rooms!I got exacting what l payed for!Clean modest room, with a good sleep quality!The location is the best in Nicosia, once you are no more than 200 ms of the Ledras street and 400 ms from the check point that you can cross to visit theTurkish side!Worth the money!!!",Kipros Accomodation
30,"The location for walking around central Nicosia is brilliant!!! They were flexible with check in times which was really handy as well and they saved us a parking space out front which saved a lot of trouble! even if it was the size of a scooter!We stayed for one night while in Cyprus to visit friends and see a bit more of the City so didn't want to spend much and it was just a bed for the night. The room was little dated but it was as per the photos and relatively clean and spacious, we were in room 6 with it's own private shower room and toilet. We got what we paid for essentially.Absolutely make a visit to Pivo whilst in Nicosia, a micro brewery and restaurant near the green line, you will not be disappointed!!!",Kipros Accomodation
20,"We weren’t expecting much from this budget BnB but we were hoping for cleanliness. The room was dirty, bed linen filthy, shower leaked as well as being tiny, and to top of our short stay the windows don’t seal and the room was extremely noisy. The couple were really nice but this is not accommodation I would recommend.",Kipros Accomodation
40,We booked 2 rooms for our group for 2 nights. The location was magnificent and the welcome was excellent. This is a small Greek hotel with all of the charm and foibles to be expected. We had rooms on the second floor that were very spacious and quiet. We also took the breakfast that was on offer and this was simple but lovely. Definitely worth a visit.,Kipros Accomodation
40,"Great little value for money accommodation. For the price you pay the location is great, staff very friendly and advice for eating places are excellent. Car parking available for free. Clean basic room, which is what we were after. Would stay again on our next visit. Nice roof top area for sitting and watching the stars.",Kipros Accomodation
50,It is a family hotel with a nice and cozy furnuture. The staff is friendly and willing to help us finding nice places in Nicosia. The rooms were clean and had a good airconditioning. And a really nice rooftop!,Kipros Accomodation
30,"On the plus side the location is perfect near Ledra St. The room is a good size, with fridge, kettle etc.On the downside the bed was hard and uncomfortable, the bathroom was 'compact' and although the hotel was isolated from external sounds, guests coming and going were amplified into the room.Decor is deliberately vintage and quite interesting. No breakfast, although that's not really an issue being so close to the center.Cheap and easy city option for a couple of nights and close to the Ledra St crossing into the North if that is your destination.",Kipros Accomodation
20,"Basic and not perfect budget solution to Nicosia. Best feature ends up to be... the owners themselves, always concerned about guests well being. That includes car parking personal assistance. Great location to visit old downtown Nicosia. Near green line crossing also.Rooms are basic, clean (except for a minor detail), not perfectly isolated regarding street noise. Great free WIFI.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"Kipros is close to shops, restaurants, the border crossing and the bus station at Solomos Square but far enough away to have quietness in the rooms. Get off your bus e.g. from Larnaca, at Solomos Square bus station, turn towards its rear and follow your nose for half a km. 90% of Greek Cypriots speak English and will be pleased to direct you. You may see many Sikhs and Filipinas on the street, even Nepalese, but several helped us when out and about. The family members running the accommodation are very pleasant and helpful. We had a singing bathroom fan on arrival but were transferred immediately. They just want to give good service. Recommended accommodation at a reasonable price.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"This boutique hotel is perfect.From the outside it isn't anything to look at, but once your inside and up the stairs the whole place opens up.It is the most prettiest and well taken care of hotel that i have stayed and you can see the love that has gone into it. The owner said that everything is homemade. It's stunningThe room was a perfect size. The bed comfortable and bathroom fine.I will definitely stay here again .",Kipros Accomodation
30,"Wonderful location as it is really near lydra street,where many fast foods restaurants and bars are located.the owner is really polite and so is her mother.got to do sth about the water,though,it was cold!",Kipros Accomodation
20,"The location is very central, in the middle of the old town, close to all the main attractions. Staff is very nice and helpful and they gave us immediately a new room when the AC didn't work... The AC was supposed to work as a heating as well. But it didn't. We were there in December and it was cold. The accommodation might be a good option in summer, in Winter it isn't though. The interior design looked really nice, with vintage furniture. Despite that, it wasn't properly cleaned. In the first room, there was a razorblade for female legs as a leftover, in the second room the some dishes were dirty. In other words, if we stayed longer than these two days, we'd changed the accommodation after the first night.",Kipros Accomodation
40,"Kipros Accommodation is an interesting option for no frills travellers who want to visit the old part of Nicosia. First of all, the position is fantastic: in a narrow, quiet street inside the Venetian Walls, very close to the famous Ledra street. No need to say that it's full of everything within a short distance: monuments, shops, restaurants, bus stop. It is located inside an old building and also the furniture is a bit aged, but the owner did a very good job with the stuff he had. Rooms are nicely decorated, you can find all you need for a basic stay, such as tv, fridge and, very important in the hot summer, air conditioning. My room was spacious, whereas the bathroom a bit small. In the common areas there are some old pieces of furniture that give the place a lovely vintage atmosphere. On the roof there is a terrace with armchair to relax after a long day sightseeing. The owner and the girl at the reception were very nice and caring, my room had a little problem and they immediately gave me a new one, then they were often asking if I was ok there, if I needed something or any help. They were both fantastic, my time there was the best thanks to them.",Kipros Accomodation
40,"The price/quality relationship is excelent. The guesthouse is in the city center, in a good area, very close to Ledra Street. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The owners are very nice and cooperative. Doubtlessly, I recommend it.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"Nice place in the city center of Nicosia not far from the main street and from the border.Really nice inside, not expensive.Staff is kind but the have some problems with english.Not far also from the most important restaurant of the city center.",Kipros Accomodation
40,"A family run hotel right in the heart of old Nicosia.You get more than you pay for. If you want perfection, and shiny, glittery luxury, and a hotel that looks like any other 5* hotel in the world, go stay in the Hilton and pay 6 times the rate.if you want to be right in the heart of the old city, and get value for money, Kipros is the place for you.A little rough round the edges, you still get air con, a fridge, a cold shower and free wifi, which is all you really need.The family owners are helpful and friendly, and the new roof top terrace is a great addition.if you have a snobby attitude to anything not exactly perfect, don't come here. For everyone else, it's a great place to stay in the heart of a great city.",Kipros Accomodation
40,"This was a hotel choice close to the main bus station as we were visiting Nicosia just for an overnight stay and needed somewhere close. This is a family run hotel and easy to find. Although the description of the room did not quite match what we had, it was not an massive issue as it was only for 1 night. We had a room at the rear of the hotel so very quiet. Not only is it close to the bus station but also a 2 minute walk to Ledra street which is the main shopping street with the border crossing to the occupied north of Cyprus (do not forget your passport). My wife and I went through on the evening and also the next morning as the food is cheaper and also there are some good bargains to be had on the north side.Going back to the hotel itself, it is basic and lacking a lot of the comforts of other hotels but is a good option for short stays such as ours.",Kipros Accomodation
40,"I arrived Nicosia from Paphos by express bus, so the bus arrived Dionisiou Solomou Square. Kipros Accomodation is located within 5 minutes walking from the bus stop. Also just 2 (small) blocks away from Ledra street, which is main shopping pedestrian street. Once you get to Ledra street, cross point is pretty close.Breakfast is not included, I expected there would be mini fridge equipped in each room so that I could keep yogurt, milk etc. To my surprising, there is no fridge :(You will have the followings;free wifi, hair dryer, towel, linen, TV, AC and complimentary drinks.There is a nice public area at reception but there is no computer for guests to use, you have to bring your own. It is 3 storeys but there is no elevator. It looks like there are 9 rooms in total. 8 on second floor and 1 on third floor. All rooms could face street except one. If you want the 1 that doesn't face street, you better ask the owner in advance.There is also smoking area on second floor, which is technically outside. I should call it patio, I think.It is an old house but I would rather express ""antique"" It is lovely. Some furniture is just old, I have to admit it. still I enjoy the atmosphere.I don't think the reception is open for 24 hour. When I arrived, there was no one in spite of I had informed my arrival (estimated) time, which was a bit disappointing.If you need to head to Larcana airport from there, I recommend to take shared taxi. There is no direct shuttle bus from old town.",Kipros Accomodation
10,"Basically, it was far away from what we saw on the hotel profile and rates and reviews.The bed was very unconfortable, the room very noisy and the bathroom very small and old.We were very susprised about the rates this place got on tripadvaisor.",Kipros Accomodation
50,"Kipros hotel is a family business with very nice and friendly staff.We are staying here for 3 nights and we have received a very quiet room at the back side.Our window looks out in the green with some Orange trees out of reach unfortunately 😊.The room has a warmly interior with bathroom.Our bed offers us sweet dreams and breakfast we bring ourselves. There is a small terrace near our room 8,nice for a cup of Coffee or tea in the morning...Very nice experience for a very cheap price.",Kipros Accomodation
40,"We enjoyed this hotel enough to return again a week later. The first night was in room 8 - a lovely quiet room which overlooks gardens and quaint stone buildings. This room is relatively small but well furnished and it has a lovely bathroom. The host offered us room 6 on our return and this is much larger with a sitting area and a coffee table. This room has some drawbacks though; it faces onto the street which is noisy, particularly at night when some imbeciles seem to consider reving engines and loud stereos to be more socially acceptable!The host is very welcoming and helpful. He provided us with a very welcome welcome drink and ordered a shuttle for us to take us to the airport at Larnaca (11 euros each).Some items that would improve the hotel are a little more maintenance of paint finishes (particularly on the inside of the outside wall - room 8) and more attention to the little details such as making sure all light bulbs work. There is no opportunity to increase the size of the tiny bathrooms but perhaps something could be done to prevent the water flooring out of the room 8 shower onto the floor?The hotel has a very relaxed vibe and is better than most budget hotels - you won't regret booking here.",Kipros Accomodation
30,The place is just enough for a short stay. The room size was tight the window needs dark blinders. The staff are nice. The location is perfect next to the main centre and the crossing. It was a good experience,Kipros Accomodation
50,"The stay at Kipros Accommodation was far more than just a stay at a hotel! The property is family run an you immediately feel the friendliness and hospitality of the family members! They are super kind and helpful, more like friends than just staff. The location of the property cannot be better, the interior design is really great and in very good taste. I didn't have any problems with hot water - it was always there! You will have a great time there! Thanks Tassos for such a nice experience!",Kipros Accomodation
