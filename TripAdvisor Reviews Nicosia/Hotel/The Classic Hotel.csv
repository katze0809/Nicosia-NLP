50,"I spent just two days (one night) at The Classic Hotel and I wish I could spend more: It was a short business trip and booking was made by my local colleagues. The hotel looks really modern and must have been recently renovated althougg you can find some tiny spots here and there showing its age. Staff was more than typically kind, offering to help me navigate the hotel, the city etc. I was also offered a plug adaptor (the rooms mostly have the UK type and not the continental Europe ones) when I aasked for. The room was really spacious, with a comfortable double bed, a convenient working desk, fast WiFi (free), two cozy armchairs, safe, hairdryer etc. - all a traveler needs. Plus, there was a bottle of water, coffee capsule, tea and water boiler - all for free, too! This is…",The Classic Hotel
40,"This hotel is in an amazing position near the main Ledra Street with all its shops and restaurants. The highlight of the hotel has to be the staff for whom nothing is too much trouble, Costa and Maria in particular. The hotel is newly refurbished. The bedrooms are small but have good quality bedding and very comfortable beds and the bathroom is really well appointed, with olive oil toiletries. Breakfast is flavoursome and this is a perfect place to stay for a short break if you are exploring the area. Helpful?",The Classic Hotel
40,"Good people, quirky but comfortable rooms, our was a bit small but hey ! Convenient for the main shopping and eating areas and right by the historical places of interested. Food was excellent - they make their own bread too.",The Classic Hotel
50,"The best hotel experience so far, super pretty, the rooms are amazing, and the ac is just perfect haha Before we were in Vietnam we message them on whatsapp to get a shuttle from the airport and they were super helpful! Great location, friendly staff, alots of great breakfast options, what else could I say? The best!",The Classic Hotel
50,"I had read mixed reviews of this property and so was a little worried what to expect. The property definitely exceeded my expectations (perhaps I came with quite low expectations having read other reviews!). Reception staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful and went out of their way to help with any questions I had including explaining map of the city, assistance with airport transfer and recommendations what to see and do. My room (205 - standard single room but actually had twin beds) was on the same level as the elevator so i didn't have to negotiate the rabbit-warren of stairs which others have complained about in other reviews. The airconditioning worked perfectly well and the room was basic but clean. The bathroom was small but renovated, so had marble finish and…",The Classic Hotel
30,"There are some positives about this hotel. It is on the southwestern edge of the walled part of the city, meaning that it is about ten minutes by foot from the centre of the old town. Since a lot of the activity has moved to the modern part of Nicosia, this quiet area shares with others in the old town a paradoxical 'suburban' feeling, but it is pleasant enough. In the hotel itself, the staff is cordial, if not overly warm. It is hard to say whether the air conditioning was functioning, if it was, it was very discreet and it didn't feel like air was circulating in the room (and I am not for heavy AC and very cool rooms when the temperature outside is over 40°C). The one point that leans towards a 3 mark rather than 4 is cleanliness. While I wouldn't say that the rooms are dirty, the bathroom had some stains that could have been easily removed and that stayed during my whole stay. While I don't care about luxury or fancy equipment, I did expect rooms to be as clean as I am used to in other European cities for comparable prices, bar perhaps London. If an effort can be done in that direction, it will be easier to recommend this hotel.",The Classic Hotel
40,"We have stayed in the hotel Classic Nicosia for six nights ending june 15, 2019. temps very warm outside air conditioning works perfectly we had room 221 facing busy street and Venetian walls noise no issue; 229 same view larger; opposite side 226, 212 (quite large) 209 about same size ours, a premium Room about $140E. I have read many negative reviews and want to commentHotel very clean and excellent staff; our room good size modern nice bath with drying rack comfortable king which appears oversized so sheets hang but not fitted so they can crawl. Solution is to book twin bed rooms which is standard here and everything fits. Local Twins are side/ side large, and comfortable. Breakfast very good and also buffet lunch hotel minutes from everything. Tip: they can not give you advice on north. If desired walk through gate about six blocks to taxi and 30 e gets you Hillarion and Kyrenia incl wait at Hillarion and new taxi return via Abbey same incl wait, Dolma cheaperHotel is like best western but grade up not however four seasons or luxury boutiques like Josephine in Larnaca or sir Paul limmosol;ok however and our room great. Negative reviews I think unwarranted and most guests perfectly happyArea and Town Safe at night; many good restaurants.",The Classic Hotel
20,"A group of us have stayed at this hotel for a number of years but this year ALL our rooms had some faults - mine for example - plugs did not work (sockets were hanging off the wall) and the safe did not work (batteries hanging out) and no-one's air conditioning worked.The staff were universally very nice and loyal to their employers but they could not resolve all the problems so made us simply move rooms.We were not offered any compensation/refund for this inconvenience and my friend, who had to move rooms 3 days after me, was offered the room I had moved out of.Food is lovely - bar service very poor. They ran out of Ouzo - can you believe?The waiter could not tell the difference between red and white wineA total fiasco and the owners are very stupid - we will not return",The Classic Hotel
20,"On the positive side a good location, a friendly reception and good breakfast buffet with pleasant personnel.On the negative side a very beat-up room with claustrophobic bathroom and without working AC.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Situated just inside the walled city's wall in front of the fire-brigade station, this place is very convenient if you want to see and visit the old city and also cross over to the North side from the nearby border checkpost open 24 hours. The hotel is clean and fine with basic in room facilities (but no coffee/tea making possibility). The main irritating point is that there are too many stairs to negotiate even on this 2-storey hotel because their lift goes up one floor only, and so if you have heavy luggage or other walking problems, this is frustrating. Breakfast buffet was reasonable and fine",The Classic Hotel
20,Terrible bathroom.You can not been asked to pay for that bathrrom.So tiny that when you get up from toilet you hit your head in the towels hunger! It was late at night when i arrived so i had no energy to complain but now i regret.Going to your room is a funny story.You go down to get the stair that is beside to go up.Only the staff in the poor breakfast was polite and friendly.Price for what you are offered should be no more than 30 euro.,The Classic Hotel
40,"Great location for a conference event but it seems a bit of a maze when looking for your room that can be very noisy facing busy streets but still well worth the short stroll to the very center of town with the two main streets reserved for pedestrians and full of shops, bars, and restaurants and the border crossing. The bathroom built a step up is a trap for tall people. Asking for payment at check-in is very rude. The food is very good but you can't avoid pointing at the nightmare of small yellow ants crawling in your otherwise very comfortable bed.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I’ve stayed several times at this hotel and it’s the best value for money in Nicosia. The location can’t be better. 5m walk to shopping and restaurants. The basic rooms are awful, don’t book those. Executive rooms are modern, very spacious and worth the extra money. The architect must have suffered from severe mental illness. It’s a maze and very hard to find your room but once you’re there, it’s clean and comfortable.",The Classic Hotel
10,"The room at the first floor was subject to a constant noise emanating from a large motor working continueously next door. We requested to change the room, to which they responded immediately. Elas, the new room was above the discoteque operated by the hotel with loud and booming music.One can enot run a reasonable hotel and a discoteque at the same time. Avoid stying at The Classical!",The Classic Hotel
30,"A modern and simple facade hide behind a very complicated space with corridors, rooms and stairs. Some rooms doesn't have windows to the exterior. The window is to a covered terrace where you can not see the light from outside. There are damages in the finishing (the shower floor has cracks), the door room can not be open wide because the floor is not flat...",The Classic Hotel
30,"Great location. When we arrived it was a last minute booking for 1 night. The room we were allocated was terrible and I refused to stay in it. We were upgraded foc which was really appreciated . The 2nd room was nice but could do with a little bit of tlc. Bed was huge which was nice as it was August and at least my husband and myself could sleep well with the a/c on. The breakfast was really nice and lots of choice, very friendly staff. Late check out too which allowed us to do some more exploring and grab a quick shower once again before we headed off. Yes we would stay here again in the 2nd room for what we paid with breakfast included. We never explored the gym etc as we were not there long enough.",The Classic Hotel
10,"Had a business trip to Nicosia, Cyprus and we booked in this hotel due to its convenient location close to my meetings, and 5 minutes walking distance from Lydra street. Well, thats the only positive thing about this Hotel. Now I move to the nagging part. At the entrance thereis no ramp, you have to carry your luggage for 6 steps no matter what (no concierge of course). The receptionist gave me the access key to room 106, which due to the “sophisticated” architecture of the hotel had to, again, carry my luggage through a stair, but to get to the stairs you have to pass through an office, yes, my eyes popped too. When i reached my room, the access key didn’t function, so i had to go back to the receptionist, of course carrying my luggage, so that she can issue a valid access card.Entering the room, there was a window that looks over .... the water tanks, yes the water tanks. Took sometime for the AC to turn on, however there was an awful bad smell in the room that i had to sleep with.The breakfast was ok. The second day i asked them to change the room which they responded to momentarily i must admit.While migrating from my 106 to 211, i forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom, when i called the receptionist he explicitly asked me to come over to to the front desk and take the old access key and go pick them up myself. Speechless I was, but I had to adhere.One more con i had to add is that you have to go through a labyrinth to get to your room therefore, if you plan to stay in this hotel make sure you have a good memory.To sum up with a positive note, the fire station is directly facing the hotel so you dont have to worry if you know what i mean :)A nay for sure.",The Classic Hotel
30,"The hotel looks recently refurbished. Unfortunately, our room had no windows outside and was really dark. There was a small enclosed courtyard at the back which had no windows. A really strange room, however it was clean and comfortable (apart from the lack of light). The only light was from two bed side lamps and the headboard (which you can see from the pictures).While the hotel was in a really good location and reasonably priced, the lack of light / window was really off putting. The gym was also really poor, most of the machines were out of order which was frustrating.I would stay at this hotel again but make sure to request a room with a window!!",The Classic Hotel
10,"Great location, helpful staff, good breakfast, rooms have not been renovated in years., dead roaches on the floor (at least they spray), silverfish on the room floor and even on the bed and pillows. My room was tiny, had burned out lights, a tiny sink that dripped on the floor, a small bottle of hair conditioner that was so old it was stuck solid. In general, the hotel seems not to be taken care off, no attention is paid to details and comfort of guests. All of the above is greatly emphasized by the fact that it is not a cheap hotel. I would stay again only if the price was cut down to no more than €60 per night.",The Classic Hotel
30,"My husband and I stayed at The Classic for two nights this week. On first sighting we were delighted with the hotel - it is attractive from the outside and the lobby and public areas are nicely appointed and decorated. It is a strangely laid out hotel with many different floor levels and a maze of corridors! Certainly it suitable for the physically challenged. Our bedroom was a good size but shabby and in need of a fresh coat of paint. Very small bathroom with no windows and no working fan ... Bed very comfortable but linen a disgrace as it did not fit the bed so the bottom sheet could not be tucked under the mattress and moved as you slept leaving you sleeping on a mattress without a cover. This is unhygienic and, in our opinion, totally unacceptable. Surely it would not pass a health inspection! Pity, as perfect location for bus station and easy walk to Ledra Street and all the fascination of the old city with its buzz and lovely atmosphere, many coffee shops and tavernas and restaurants. Good breakfast and very pleasant staff.",The Classic Hotel
40,For what you pay this is a perfectly good hotel. Our room was clean and spacious and the aircon worked very well. Basic buffet breakfast but enough to fill you up until lunchtime. Reception and breakfast staff were all very helpful.,The Classic Hotel
40,"A quiet classic hotel located just minutes walking form crowded town center, a neat and clean room with facilities just enough for our city break stay. Dairy breakfast was great with warmth hospitality, food good to start every single sightseeing day. Price also reasonable in the area. We had pleasure stay in the hotel.",The Classic Hotel
20,"Unfortunately the room I stayed was below average.Kinda of blind room with no external windows, very intense smell of cooking coming from the kitchen below and WiFi was very weak!Pity I expected more!!!",The Classic Hotel
40,"The Classic Hotel is a reasonable hotel with a decent standard. It is not a top luxury hotel, but the price also reflects this. We found the rooms comfortable and the breakfast very good. There is also a complementary bottle of water in each room which was much appreciated. We both tried the hotel restaurant and found the food to be tasty and good value. The air conditioning didn't work extremely well, but we managed.",The Classic Hotel
20,"It seems to be difficult to find a good hotel in Lefkosia (Nicosia). This is one of the more expensive local hotels in town but the rooms are small and so are the shower rooms - with a tiny metal sink that looks like it comes from a wet bar. The rooms are scattered around dark corners in dim hallways. Breakfast is adequate the first morning but never varies. I don't know what you should do if you have to stay in Lefkosia but if you have a choice, the Josephine Boutique hotel in Larnaca was cheaper and much, much nicer.",The Classic Hotel
10,"I recommended Classic Hotel lot in the past. A friend stayed here and complained of a dirty room, terrible wifi service for the second time and terrible service and rude manners to guests from the waitiering staff in the restaurant for which I was an eye witness.",The Classic Hotel
30,"Location is great for walking around the Old City (main attraction of Nicosia) and the main bus station.However, the quality of this hotel is hanging on by a thread, the ones that you could see in the threadbare sheets that were too small for the mattress so kept coming off every night.The room is not particuarly clean, the floor and the bathroom, especially the shower head, needing more of a scrub. It wasn't a big room either, even just for myself, so the state that its in is pretty obvious. There were ants in the bathroom who apparently loved my toiletries, had to wash them off my toothbrush every time.The walls are also paper thin, to the point that I could hear the person typing on facebook messenger (I recognised the sounds...)The restaurant choices were pretty bland. Although breakfast was included I opted not to go, and the main restaurant/bar was very unwelcoming, but not as much as the one waitress who worked there. I was genuinely afraid to order another drink (€10 for a G&T!), for fear that she might dump it on me. Also, the mixed nuts served have seen better days.The rest of the staff were pretty friendly, but didn't know much about what to do in the city.Its a hotel where you should aim to spend as little time as possible in it, and enjoy what Nicosia has to offer (first stop - Cyprus Tourist Information!).",The Classic Hotel
40,"Staff excellent, breakfast decent with plenty of choices, and room was good size with comfy large bed, with good strong hot shower. Could have done with tea and coffee making facilities in the room though. ideally situated for ledra street crossing and bus station",The Classic Hotel
20,"This hotel could be great but little effort is being made by those running it. The building itself has a modern feel to it and the fittings in the rooms are good. The location is also good. Breakfast is fine with a decent selection. I like the layout which is a bit of a maze but quirky. Areas where this hotel needs improving are many however. These include cleanliness of the rooms which is distinctly average. Hangers in my wardrobe were mainly broken or left behind by other guests. Bed sheets used on the beds are too small and don't fully cover the mattress which creates questionable hygiene standards. They are also so thin, you can see through them to the mattress. Pillows are cheap and lumpy and somewhat grotty. When I took the spare pillow out of the wardrobe I discovered it had been used and never cleaned. In addition, many of the beds seem to have a plastic under-sheet which is hugely uncomfortable. Clearly they are expecting incontinent guests. Reception staff seem poorly trained and show little interest in providing service to the guests. Any request is greeted with a sigh. The gym is really a joke. It has barely any equipment and, whilst visiting there recently 7 of the 8 pieces of equipment had Out of Order signs on them! As I visited there in November, they had turned the air conditioning off to save on costs. This meant the room was very hot. I opened my window to discover I was facing onto the smoking courtyard so the choice was melt or inhale cigarette smoke. As hotels in Nicosia go, it is certainly a lot better than the Cleopatra, but compared to hotels elsewhere, it has some work to do. Perhaps the managers could spend some time visiting the nearby Hilton and seeking to mirror their standards of linen, cleanliness and service.",The Classic Hotel
40,"We really enjoyed our couple of nights in the Classic Hotel. It's in a great location, within east walking distance of Ledra Street, and all the shops and restaurants. Our room was very comfortable, but a slightly odd shape! The hairdryer was fixed inside the wardrobe, and it was almost impossible to use... This was not a big problem though! Comfy bed, a good location, free wifi and a very reasonable breakfast, made this an enjoyable stay. I'd recommend this hotel for a couple of nights in Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
50,"For business travelers, hotel offers a relaxing environment. Staff friendly but discreet. Breakfast is just the right mix of standard and local entries. Quiet room offers all you need and bed is just very comfy to take care of your tired back after a long day. Location is excellent, right where you need to be.",The Classic Hotel
10,"We just stayed for one night, so we took a standard room and got room 206.This room has a 'courtyard' view, basically a view towards other rooms. But the most terrible thing was that the kitchen was below us and the extractor tube ended directly next to us, blowing all the smell directly to our window. Even the window was closed we had all the smell, the complete room already absorbed it. Even it was quite hot in the room and the A/C didn't work, we couldn't open the window until midnight when the kitchen closed.The room was very basic, the bottom of the bathroom door was already black from water.The breakfast also was very simple, nothing we wanted to eat, cheap industrial products.Without the smelly room I would rate it 3 points, 'gets the job done', but with the heavy smell, it was just disgusting!",The Classic Hotel
40,"Stayed here while on a business trip. Rooms are well equipped, bed very comfy and had all I needed while away. The hotel is in a great location for the centre of town but is right across from the fire station, so can be a bit noisy at times. No car park but there is a carpark just along for 5 Euros per day. The onsite gym was a bit disappointing in that several pieces of equipment didn't work. Had a great couple of evenings in the bar, and the bar staff were a good laugh. Breakfasts were good & had one evening meal in the hotel; it was fine but there are much better options for dinner a short walk away.",The Classic Hotel
30,"The hotel has a nicely appointed lobby and two different restaurants. The breakfast room serves a nice variety of food in buffet style and the staff are friendly. The bar/restaurant right opposite the reception desk offers a more intimate setting. The food was quite good and the service was relaxed and quiet.The layout of this hotel is somewhat confusing - depending on your room number there are three different ways to get to rooms. Getting to the exercise room is particularly confusing and because the exercise room is located on top of the hotel, it offers lovely views, but also because it is on top of one of the rooms, the hours of the exercise room are quite restricted so as not to disturb the guests right underneath.My room - 103 - was quite compact. The bathroom was a particularly tight squeeze, although it is clean and well-appointed. The window in my room - and I heard the same from others - did not seal out street noise very well even when fully closed and locked. And there is a decent amount of street noise. Running the air conditioning provided a background white noise that helped. The TV had a lot of channels that were not functional or static, and the menu was quite literally Greek to me.The reception staff were helpful, although at times they seemed overwhelmed.Apart from its elegant decor, the best part of the hotel is its proximity to walking areas of the old city of Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
40,"This hotel does the job at a very reasonable price. I was staying for business and so got a corporate rate. The rooms and breakfast are good and I found the staff all very friendly and helpful. Location is great - just inside the old city walls and very close to the main walking street, restaurants etc. This achieves that illusive balance between being near the centre of things and being quite too. One thing I would say could be improved are the wireless is slow and prone to cutting out, not as fast as the website would suggest.",The Classic Hotel
50,"We had one night here to explore Nicosia. We were treated to the largest room in the hotel with a beautiful jacuzzi bath, cheese and wine. The room was amazing and we almost didn't want to leave! The hotel is in a great location for exploring Nicosia and it was a unique and interesting experience to do a border crossing on foot only minutes away from the hotel. Breakfast was a little disappointing but maybe they were running low on things as we arrived quite late. Staff were very friendly and we would like to thank them for upgrading us and for the gifts. We would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay in Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
40,The hotel is located near by the city center and the bus stations. The best bars are in 10-15 minutes on foot. The rooms are good equipped and nice. The foods are delicious and we had all time a free water for dinner and lunch.We spent a great time there.,The Classic Hotel
40,"Hello :) this was my first visit to Europe/Cyprus and I left my mind open to the whole experience, including accommodations. I've checked the TripAdvisor page for The Classic Hotel many times in anticipation of our trip. My husband is a Cypriot who left Cyprus with his family after the Turkish invasion, but had returned many times to visit, so thankfully I had the advantage of traveling with a local who speaks the language.Reception area was very modern and comfortable, the staff do speak English and are very accommodating, but you always get more out of someone when you speak their native tongue so I usually let my husband do the talking.Like I mentioned, I viewed this page many times, perusing the photos so I knew what to expect. As a couple traveling I would have thought they'd assign us a room for couples so when we entered room 225 I was a little surprised. My husband chalked it up to being in Europe. The room was as large as my childhood bedroom, not very large at all. I guess I didn't mind as we didn't spend much time in the room but again, after seeing photos I expected we would be assigned a room big enough for two.The bathroom was cute and clean, just very small with no room to lay out our toiletries, except toothbrush/paste, hand soap, etc. onto a tiny round basin attached to the wall. so I had to keep the rest on the floor in my toiletry bag. The shower was up on a platform and while showering, despite the curtain, a lot of water escaped onto the bathroom floor.The toilets here in Cyprus (and Greece) cannot handle toilet paper so after you wipe, the paper must be disposed of into the silver can next to the toilet. As an American it seemed pretty weird, but I understand the importance of keeping the plumbing clog-free lol!I usually bring a hair dryer because I have a very thick head of hair and it takes forever to dry it, but I didn't want to risk having a fire with the US-Europe conversion of electric appliances, so I opted to just use what was placed in the room. The hair dryer was small and the only way to operate it was to keep your finger on the button, which added time having to brush out my hair, press the button to get heat, put the brush and dryer down, place a section of hair onto the brush, press the button, repeat over and over and over. The hair dryer is also located inside the wardrobe which again, was different from what I expected but since the wardrobe had a full length mirror, it was a good spot to spend the 45 minutes to dry my hair while sitting on the floor each morning.The TV is big and modern but the only English channels were BBC news and BBC Financial news.There were a small desk and two small chairs beside the full-sized bed in the room. We had three large suitcases but only room to open one on the provided luggage rack, but it was no big deal.The room had a large window that does open with a view of the wall to the building across the street and of the small side street below (that street leads to Ledras Street). I usually sleep with ear plugs so I didn't hear much outside noise. There's also a fire department across the street from the hotel entrance (opposite side of the hotel from 225) and never once heard sirens. There's also a Catholic Church (maybe the only one around) which is also the Vatican's Embassy to Cyprus which also happens to be on the Occupied Turkish border so you'll hear church bells often.There are No laundry facilities on hotel property and No local laundromat. However, they do provide dry cleaning services so we opted for that. We paid $150 Euros to have a few shirts/shorts/socks and underwear cleaned. Crazy!! But it needed to be done.Each morning we would leave out a tip (as is customary here in the US) but I guess the housekeeping staff didn't know it was a tip and just left it. I finally had to write little Thank You notes for them to realize the money left out was for them.My little complaints: Ironing board and iron were provided on request (thank you :), but ironing board smelled badly of body odor when heated up. It needs a new pad.The floor was also dirty. I couldn't see physical dirt, but I put a pair of new, clean white socks on after my shower and after an hour or so of getting ready the bottoms were dark brown.I didn't take advantage of the free breakfast (I intermittent fast each morning) but my husband did and said they put out a nice spread :)Reception staff were very helpful calling for taxi service, and in the late evenings upon our return the gentleman gave us glasses with ice upon our request. They also have bottled water/sparkling water ($).Overall our stay with The Classic Hotel was wonderful and we will use them again when we return to Nicosia.Thank you, staff!",The Classic Hotel
40,"Stayed two nights so we could have a relaxed visit to the capital city. We have visited Nicosia before but always a day trip. The hotel is ideally situated very close to the green line and yet only 5 minutes walk to Ledra Street and the city centre. The hotel is comfortable, clean, tv, free wifi and good value for money. Quite happy to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good base for visiting Nicosia (both Cypriot and Turkish parts).",The Classic Hotel
30,"I stayed three nights at this hotel near the centre of Nicosia.The room was clean and tidy, very basic as befits this type of tourist/business hotel.My room was right opposite the local fire station, a little noisy, but not too bad.The breakfast was good.I found the reception staff not to be the most courteous. they did not acknowledge me waiting to have attention. One on the phone, another at a desk, totally ignoring my presence. A little rude I thought! Though one member of their staff was very helpful.",The Classic Hotel
20,"This hotel has clearly seen better days. Here for a conference and slept in a shabby, worn out room with a water stained bathroom--chipped tiles, crumbling door. The hotel's corridors carpets are also worn out. By contrast, the lobby area and restaurant look very good. Attentive and friendly staff compensated for the shabby feel, as did the location of the hotel which is just within the gates of the old town and a five minute walk to the main attraction -- Ledras Street -- for food, drink and sauntering. But really looking forward to getting home and having a long hot shower to wash-off this hotel.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Hi everyone, visited this small and lovely hotel few days ago on business. Was highly impressed by the quality of their bar but also boutique style lobby. The location is right at the hotspot of tourist attractions. And there is a small groceries store around the corner.The staff was extremely helpful however there are some downfalls to this property. The structure of the builting may make it difficult for people with disabilities or babies on carriage to move through the rooms corridors. It has a weird cross section with middle floors and stairs that may cause some discomfort to few.Breakfast was epic and awesome with amazing coffee, frwshly squeezed orange juice an scrambled eggs ( few of the offered delicacies).Room was minimal in style with a good spacung size, toilet was clean and water was hot if you needed.Due to the sun being strong on the islabd i highly suggest to ask for a room either on back side of building to help with cooling the room down for the night.",The Classic Hotel
20,"We stayed there as a couple for one night on 3rd of May. We chose the hotel due to it's close proximity to the old city centre. The hotel is small but clean and the receptionist Constantinou was polite and helpful. We stayed in room 215 which is of a decent size but the downside of it is that there is no window opening to outside so daylight is very limited. There is a door that opens into a small box size square utility room which has a settee in and an high opening that lets some air and light through but less than ideal and the room feels dark and basement like.The worst aspect was though the very limited and poor breakfast, not much to choose from. The salt and/or pepper were missing from most of the tables. The two young male Cypriot waiters were walking around completely uninterested as if they were sleep-walking. Could hardly utter a word of English so hard to communicate. Normal breakfast tea was missing and when I asked one of the waiter, he shrugged his shoulders which apparently means that they don't have it. There were no fried eggs in the buffet area and I had to then again ask for some to be fried for me. Worst still they decided to clear the buffet area and started to remove food 10 minutes before the time that breakfast is supposed to end while there were people including us still eating and coming to buffet area looking for food. It was as if they were trying to rush us along and want us out of the restaurant to what I learnt later, accommodate a business meeting. Very unprofessional and bordering on being rude to your paying customers.Hotel management needs to employ restaurant staff who are a little more enthusiastic and a bit more professional and know a thing or two about customer service.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit at this hotel. The receptionists are all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is modern and is located within the Venetian walls of Nicosia, and 7 minute walk to the Centre which is great. The rooms are not very spacious but are good enough. The breakfast is great and of good quality ingredients, but it does lack in variety however if you are staying for a long time. The only drawback for me, is that the bathroom was not up to my high standards of cleanliness. Overall, definitely recommended and would stay here in future visits of Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The hotel is Very closely to the center ,Clean room , nice breakfast and helpful staff.The price for the room is high , I think can be less.The wi-fi doesn't work so good!But any case was very good the location of the hotel",The Classic Hotel
40,"We stayed at The Classic Hotel in early April 2017. The location is great - it is within an easy 5 to 10 minute walk to Ledras Street, the tourist information center (with its free walking tours), the main bus terminal on Rigenis St. (for the inter-city, and local buses). It's on the western edge of the ""Old City"" but all the historical and cultural sites are fairly close by.Rigenis Street is fairly busy, and the hotel is directly across the road from the fire station. This is a drawback if your room faces the station (like ours) and the fire squads do their equipment checks early in morning - pretty noisy ! Ask for a room that does NOT face Rigenis Street.The front desk, restaurant, and bar staff are all very friendly, helpful, and professional. The hotel has a ""family feel"" to it, which is fitting since it is apparently owned by a family company.The breakfast buffet was very good, and offered a wide selection of the usual eggs, bacon, cured meats, breads, pastries, cereals, and fresh fruit - a really great way to start your day. We also ate dinner at the restaurant one night, the food and service was also great.A minor issue that we had was with the heating and A/C (HVAC) system . When we visited the weather was still cool, and the hotel's HVAC system was on ""heat"" setting - meaning the A/C cooling did not work. Keeping the window open was OK to cool the room, but it also resulted in hearing all the people and traffic noises on Rigenis St. which can be busy, especially on a weekend.Overall, it's a very good hotel, great location to explore Nocosia, and really helpful staff.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Good quality accommodation; comfortable rooms and good breakfast. Staff quite friendly, although one got a bit irritable trying to sort my safety box out (blaming me for following her instructions!)... Hotel not too difficult to find from the border control - and close to the Cyprus Museum, which is well-worth a visit.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Located just inside the old city walls, near the Paphos Gate and very close to the Cyprus Museum, the Classic Hotel is a great base from which to explore the old city. It is easily within walking distance to all the main sights as well as the Ledra Street crossing to the Turkish side of the city while being near enough to the walled city’s periphery to make it easy to navigate to/from the hotel by car. Although they do not have a parking lot of their own, there is limited free overnight street parking directly in front of the hotel entrance and then there is also a small lot nearby with guys who watch your car for a fee.The hotel itself is simple and basic but not lacking in any way. The decor throughout, both in the public areas and in the room, was spotless, modern and looked newly renovated. We were a bit concerned about all the stairs of which people complained but we lucked out and only had a short flight of stairs to climb to our Executive Room (#101). There is also a short flight of steps from the hotel entrance to the check in desks, but it’s only a bit tiring if you have full sized luggage. The fairly spacious room consisted of a sitting area with a desk, Queen bed and small but adequately sized bathroom. A/C was powerful and the WiFi was good but there was not much natural light despite the big windows.The only staff we encountered were the front desk receptionists and the breakfast room attendant. Only one of the receptionists seemed to be fluent in English but all were very friendly and made every effort to be helpful. The breakfast attendant was a bit overwhelmed the day we were there as there was a sports team in the dining room gobbling everything up as quickly as she could bring them out. She still did it with a smile though! The food offerings were not extensive but satisfactory with the highlight being a nice big automated coffee machine, which made some delicious cappuccinos and lattes.The Classic Hotel offers a no frills but comfortable and clean stay with modern design flourishes in a good location. You can’t really beat it for the price.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Inside the old City, indise the ancient walls.Nice spacy room and bathroom.Even at the road, there is not much noise.Also the breakfast is good, with many choices.You need a map to find the rooms and then the lobby again.",The Classic Hotel
40,The location is great for seeing the city sites and the restaurant and bar scene. I find the rooms rather tiny and the service a bit clinical and removed. Wouldn't say you get a warm welcome here. I have been touring Cyprus for two weeks and found this place to be rather cold in attitude.,The Classic Hotel
30,"I stayed for a business weekend in Nicosia.Very centrally located, near Ledra street and the night life.Nice common areas and extremely friendly and helpful staff.Old fashioned furniture in the bathroom and the room.Needs renovation and refurbish urgently.Strange and difficult entrance in the corridors and rooms.Very bad condition of the sheets and the throats.I have never seen so bad condition of the towels.There is no isolation at the rooms from the road noise.The breakfast is normal.The price is rather high fot the quality of the room.",The Classic Hotel
40,"This is a great hotel with all the important things a plus.In no particular order:Great location, close to the centre of the city, the bus station and the Leda gate to cross to Turkish Cyprus.Comfortable beds and spacious rooms.My wife had been spooked by previous reviews which talked about noise from the disco and the need not to have a room facing the street. We were offered an alternative room but opted for the original offering, on the first floor, facing the street. We heard nothing from the disco, which was on the day we arrived.There is a decent restaurant though somewhat sparsely populated in mid January.There is good wifi.There are ample charging points, both for U.K. three pin, continental two pin, and shaver/toothbrush.In Nicosia everyone drives even absurdly short distances. Consequently, as well as the large municipal car park by the bus station, there are numerous private car parks at about €3 per day.Staff are friendly and helpful.The bed is comfortable, and although we could not have the twin beds we preferred, it was so large that the readily supplied two duvets achieved the same result.So why not five stars?There are a number of minor irritations, which, in aggregate, stop this hotel being ideal.Like so many modern hotels, the lighting is trendy. Sit in the armchairs and watch tv - fine. Want to look at papers or even, so old fashioned, read a book - forget it.There is a walk-in closet but no shelves or drawers to store small items like underclothes.To use the safe, you need to lie on your stomach as it is so low.Incredibly, there is no mini-bar.A trendy bath with shower head but no curtain means that if you have a stand up shower, the bathroom floor floods.So four stars, not five.",The Classic Hotel
20,"The hotel is basic, but mostly clean. Staff are very friendly; the best thing about the hotel for sure. It is fairly well situated close to Paphos Gate. Breakfast was not a good experience and they ran out most days we were there, plus the food was warm at best. One of the nights we were there, the bar was booked for a party that blasted out music (our room vibrated) until 2am and we were all horribly tired. If you book a space for a party, be sure the guests not invited are on the highest floor. It may have helped. We would not recommend this place nor stay here again.",The Classic Hotel
50,"The location of the hotel is in the heart of the city.The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Very clean and modern. Very nice restaurant. You must visit the hotels wine bar, absolutely fantastic!!!!!",The Classic Hotel
40,"Good things: waiter phoned his own dentist to get him to see us on his day off [thanks Dimitri], staff organised taxis, couldn't have been more supportive. Breakfast is lovely. We were there 4 weeks, and didn't get tired of it. Good range of good quality food. Very handy for restaurants, sightseeing as it's close to the old townNot so good: room really small for 2 people, we couldn't unpack properly although we were travelling light, grouting round bath mouldy, towels thin, no bath robes, gym bike a bit wonky, no scalesAll in all we would go back, as the staff were so nice,",The Classic Hotel
30,"I visited Nicosia and The Classic Hotel two weeks ago (November 2016). The hotel is down town Nicosia which is a good thing because in less than 5 minutes, you are in the center of the city. It is very close to Cuprus Museum too. You can go on foot in 5-10 minutes. The negative part is that the neighborhood is not that good.By biggest disappointment was the actual room which was too small. We booked a double room and we could hardly move around the room. We were waiting for something bigger, depending on the pictures on their website. The aircondition system didn't heat up and sometimes we were a little cold. There was a little fridge but it was locked (for some unexplained reason) and we asked for the key, in order to use it.Positives: The stuff was friendly in general. The breakfast was pretty good. The decoration in the whole hotel is modern. No smoking hotel but there was a cute open area inside the hotel where anyone could go there and smoke.",The Classic Hotel
50,"We visit this hotel very often because of its wine bar!Friday night is blue bar night!The music starts at 9.30 rock jazz balads and after 11.30 80's disco rock music.Best place for a small party.nice place ,friendly staff and very good food.We enjoy every time our night there.All plates very delicious .Spinach ravioli is my favourite! Chicken souvlaki or pork chops also very good .The hotel is modern and clean and you have easy access in the town.",The Classic Hotel
30,"On the positive side , the location is excellent and the breakfast is good.The hotel is not expensive but not cheap neither.The room is small , missing the comfort and the charm and the space , ............... !!!The bathroom is ....., the sink (lavabo) is too small , .........The receptionist was a polite gentlman and no complaint.",The Classic Hotel
30,"A nice and clean hotel with a decent breakfast and friendly and service minded staff. Very well located with only a short walk to many of the sights.However, it do need some minor repairs (e.g. the floor under my door had swollen up, making it impossible to open completely) but these issues are not yet to big of an issue.",The Classic Hotel
50,Reception staff very willing to help.My room was spacious - others not so but functional in all casesEverywhere cleanFood at breakfast was varied and good qualityLovely comfy bedBest air-con ever. Actually faced the bed and it was silent - brill!,The Classic Hotel
40,"I stay here when I am going out in Nicosia center. It's a great location for all the bars and restaurants in Lydra which is all walking distance from the hotel. The only small issue with the hotel is that if you have to park there is only a few spaces outside the hotel but there are a lot of parking areas around where you can pay 3 euro.Hotel is very clean and very comfortable, would recommend to anyone who is spending a short visit to Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
20,"I've just come back from a 4 night stay at this hotel. The location is quite convenient as others have mentioned (For being in Nicosia). Sadly, I found a few things quite poor and not really acceptable to return here.ANTS! There were a few tiny ants (looked a bit like a small brown sugar ants) all over the room. On the first night of getting there and pulling back the bed sheet - there were 2-3 ants in the bed. This was not the company I was looking for!! These ants were often seen in the bathroom, on the table in the room and floors if you looked for them. There were not a swarm of these ants - but they were there. I was staying there for a wedding and despite taking a brand new shirt out of the packaging and leaving it on the bed for about 2-3 mins whilst getting ready - there was an ant crawling on it etc...Maybe the ant problem can be solved. There were other issues though.. There's a really really bad lack of space to put clothes in this hotel. The one wardrobe there is, is mostly consumed by a locked fridge, a safe and a duvet (that didn't look like it was freshly laundered any time soon). Maybe not an issue to an overnight stay.The breakfast included was pretty dire. The food they had there was not of a high quality. Even when they put fresh fried eggs out - they looked like they had sat in the kitchen for an hour previous (I'm sure they had not but it's how they looked). All food in the buffet quite low volume (Ie - you can have scrapings of scrambled eggs left over). The coffee was so bad (Please buy some better beans). The restaurant is called 59 knives. It should be re-named to 59 knives and 0 teaspoons. From the 4 mornings we had there, only once was there actually a tea spoon to stir your coffee/tea!!!The place seemed busy for conferences. I did notice another couple cancelling their stay there whilst I was passing reception (No idea of their reasons to be fair). If you use the stairs and not the lift - there were some plates left on the side of the stairs from someone's room service for the entire 4 nights stay I was there. My bed also had quite a few hairs (the short curly kind) near my pillow which were not mine too (Only noticed on the last day after room had been cleaned).Not a place I will be returning too. I don't have a history of giving harsh reviews and with no disrespect to other guests - I'm really not sure how they can give this place 5 stars!!",The Classic Hotel
50,"We were not staying here, only popped in for a rest, drinks and mid-morning coffee after travelling from Larnaca/Ayia Napa. This hotel is situated right in the City Centre by Ledra Street and is very close to the Green Line where you can cross into the Turkish Northern sector at Ledra Palace Hotel border control point, just remember to bring your passport.The Classic Hotel is a modern boutique style establishment with extremely friendly and welcoming staff. We took mid-morning coffee in the bar (see photo) which is smart and fashionable. There was a diplomatic conference scheduled for that day and given the location is an ideal choice for such political discussions and negotiations.The next time I am in Cyprus I would consider staying here as it offers a different angle to Cyprus, rather than staying on the coast in one of the resorts.I was very impressed and as the saying goes, travel does certainly broaden the mind and serves to educate us all.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Unfortunately our flight out of Cyprus was cancelled and we were put up in a prestigious hotel on the outskirts of Nicosia which shall remain nameless. Despite the grandeur and prestige I missed the familarity of the Classic.After a week at the Classic, I was on friendly terms with all the staff. This hotel is very much a nest in the centre of the old town. What it lacks in facilities it more than makes up for in charm. Being in the old town you are no more than a five minute walk from a vibrant, throbbing, and enchanting city centre where a very good meal can be had for no more than 5 Euros a Head.The breakfast at the Classic was first class and far better than the prestigious hotel. The same goes for the air conditioning which was outstanding.I loved the Classic because it was very much a boutique hotel off the Tourist trail popular with business personal and devoid of my fellow countrymen.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The hotel is in a great position, easy to get around. The room was perfect and spacious, very clean also. The breakfast needs to be served hot but lots of choice.The hotel is very near the green line and easy to cross to the north side providing you remember your passport!",The Classic Hotel
50,"My boyfriend's cousin recommended as not far from her - visiting her and her family. modern, clean and large room with own patio. No t expected at all. Free daily breakfast in their lovely restaurant which was great, well prepared. Beds are large and bathrooms are clean and well-appointed.",The Classic Hotel
50,"We wanted a Hotel located in the Old City of Nicosia so we could explore on foot. This hotel meets this need but offers so much more. The room was spacious and well equipped. It had a safe and the WiFi was good, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning great. The room was quiet, which we much prefer to having a view. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and good. We ate in the hotel restaurant one night and again the food was really good. The only downside was the lack of other diners. If you are looking for a well located hotel in Nicosia at a reasonable price for tourism or business this one comes highly recommended.",The Classic Hotel
30,"This hotel is trying hard to meet the needs of the business traveller and although basic it has some nice touches. The main thing it needs to do to improve is to buy new pillows and towels. It is surprising how hotels don't realise the importance of good bedding and white towels. The pillows are lumpy, smell and are letting the standard of the hotel down. The towels are threadbare. Other than that they are beginning to get the basics right. People were friendly and helpful. Not sure why the bar is closed on a Sunday evening! Business travellers arriving for a few days work want to unwind without going out to the crowded Leda Street area.",The Classic Hotel
30,"A disappointing stay after my last visit in 2014.Arrival - efficient and although my air conditioning didn't work in room 227, I was quickly shown to another room 215.Room - had no window but an entry to a strange courtyard. Aircon was working well once it got going.Bathroom - tired, not enough light. Good hot water and water pressure though. Towels ok.Bed - comfy enough although pillows are lumpy. Sheet for cover was ok considering how hot it was.Breakfast - day 1 - bacon cold, scrambled eggs cold, sausages cold (this was at 7am might I add)Day two - same as day 1!!Saving grace was a good coffee, and nice continental spread. Stuck to that for the second morning.Gym - very clearly not 24 hours. One treadmill broken completely (would not power up) the other completely dangerous as the belt stalled when you ran on it! (I only weigh 75kgs too!)Machines - broken. Probably circa late 90s - aged and no signs of any maintenance whatsoever.No free weights - see pictureSauna - didn't dare try it!!I've given this hotel 3 stars this time, it would have been two had it not been for the friendly and efficient staff.",The Classic Hotel
40,A decent hotel in the center of Nicosia.I had a very pleasant stay. Everything was above average and the staff very nice and helpful. I would definitely use it the next time I'll go to Nicosia for business or pleasure.,The Classic Hotel
30,"This hotel is in a good, central location in Old Nicosia but I think standards have slipped since I last stayed here in 2014. The quality of the breakfast (choice, quality of the food) isn't as good. the room this time was also really small. The bathroom looked tired and in need of some refurbishment.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Nice price to valueGood location and not far away from the main shopping street Ledras and other tourist sights. Easy access to the north side if you want to venture there.The hotel is a small boutique type hotel. Room is tastefully decorated but I found the materials a bit cheap and the room a bit Spartan. Air conditioning in high summer during the day is not strong enough but it is understandable when outside temperate is 40C. I would recommend staying here if you need to stay somewhere close to the border to the north, such as just come back from a trip there.",The Classic Hotel
30,Will not be my first choice. Extremely difficult to find parking. The rooms are small and with no enough height even though modern. Limited options for breakfast. The location is good as it is within walking distance from the market.,The Classic Hotel
30,"Stayed for 2 nights in June as the third leg of my trip around Cyprus. Hotel just a couple of minutes walk from bus station, main tourist streets and Green Line, also right opposite Police and Fire stations although did not hear anything from them. Hotel quite quirky and my room did not have a window but rather a door onto an inner courtyard. Free wifi and free safe. I found the bed extremely uncomfortable - it was very very very firm, now this may suit some but not me.Breakfast quite nice and some nice artwork in reception area. Staff efficient and polite. Small gym but unfortunately lot of the equipment didn't appear to be working properly.Overall excellent value for money stay and would rate as good hotel.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Imagine 80 students who land in the hotel. I cannot say how much I have to thank the hotel for hosting us for the summer school. The hotel is so amazing, all the employees are very kind and make very well their job. The room are very nice, well equipped and clean. The foods in general is really good even if sometimes the meat is a bit dry. All the places are well arranged. It's also good situated, 5 minutes to go to Lidras street and they're a lots of shops and restaurants all around. The municipality swimming pool is 15 min from the hotel by foot so it's good alternative to refresh himself due to absence of swimming pool in the hotel.I recommand!",The Classic Hotel
40,"Booked for one night to visit Nicosia before going off to our next hotel for the rest of the week on the coast.The hotel is quite cute in terms of design, we liked the connection to art, the nice inner courtyard to sit in the evening and the good location with only a few minutes walk to the main areas of the old town. The room was clean and functional (although AC in our room did not work) with a good shower, breakfast was a typical breakfast buffet for that type hotel.Staff was friendly and helpful everywhere, although I wasn't particularly impressed with the lady at reception loudly discussing the corporate rate for a United Nations guest in front of me and another guest. Having worked in hotels for 15 years I found that highly unprofessional - the rate for a room paid by one guest should never be pointed out so openly in front of others.The second downside was Irene in Reservations: communication with her via email was a little difficult and I did not appreciate being addressed as ""my dear"" in an email...and the fact that after having asked for advice with the taxi ride from Ercan airport I was told that unfortunately she couldn't help with information regarding the occupied territory. I understand that there are some sentiments involved between the 2 sides - but to be honest, I don't think it is too much to ask from the hotel to advise guests that they best take a taxi to the Ledra border crossing and get dropped off there, pay 20 Euros for the ride, and then walk across and from there the 10 minutes to the hotel (or even take another taxi). Regardless of the political situation I am sure that the hotel should be able to give this information to a guest who has booked with them.I would say it is a good base for a short visit in Nicosia, although I find that the 97 Euros including breakfast for 2 people was too high considering it is Cyprus and what you get for it. Although, due to the high price and my experience with Irene in Reservations I would not go back although I quite liked the hotel itself.",The Classic Hotel
40,"In summer 2008 i've been there for a whole month for my summer session in university and the hotel were not renovated like now but it was not bad actually, calm location in the old city, very near to the market,the city and the Turkish boarder.

The area is not the most picturesque, but you can get to the main shopping and restaurant area very easily, literally 5 minutes on foot.The room was spacious, simple but could have done with a bit of decorating, but the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was fine and there was a lot of natural light. It was almost a studio but without the kitchen. Good room.Excellent breakfast, varied and nice area to have the breakfast. This is not a big Hotel, it is friendly and almost family like. There are certain things I could not do such as charge a Taxi to my room, very annoying given the taxi ride from the airport is 50 € each way. But I will probably use again due to its simple no fuss, spacious and general good taste in the Décor.",The Classic Hotel
30,"On arrival at the hotel the reception was confused with one young girl being constantly interrupted by the male receptionist. The room was very good and the en suite facilities large and clean. However, we waited for nearly 20mins to be served in the restaurant and the waiter was just about civil, however, the food was very good. We went to breakfast which was a buffet with cold meats and cheeses also a cooked English which is what we chose, but every little bit of it was cold. The usual confusion on checking out was trumped by the male receptionist short changing us by 10euros on the cost of the evening meal. There are plenty of other hotels in Nicosia and we will definitely not return. Oh by the way if you put bottles in the fridge it would be good to also put a bottle opener and just 2 tea bags, really!",The Classic Hotel

The staff are quite welcoming and nice and make up for the lack of variety in the breakfast menu.The architecture of the hotel is intriguingly original with various levels and stairways which I think date back to the hotel serving some other function in previous times.The rooms vary a lot and I've had colleagues complain from their rooms but I must say that both rooms I stayed in were very nice and neat.The entertainment lounge has some interesting program in the evening depending on the season and the night.A recommended stay if you are not looking to spend a lot and still want a very central location.",The Classic Hotel

Check-in was a little rough as they didn't see my reservation until I arrived so I had to wait in the lobby while they prepared my room. The staff was very friendly and helpful during this time.Room - A very nice, efficient room. The bathroom was large and nicely appointed. It included a large TV (with several English-language channels), a small desk and a very comfy bed. Wifi was pretty weak in my room but when it worked it was speedy. My room had a window that opened so I could get some fresh air.Breakfast - I'm not much of a breakfast person but the selection looked typical of most hotels on Cyprus.All-in-all, a very solid hotel. I'd give it 5 stars were it not for the check-in foul-up and the dodgy wifi in my room.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The rooms were clean, the staff very helpful and the location good since it is in the old part of the city. The down part of the location is that it is central and can get noisy.

30,"The location was merely ok. Across the street from the entrance is a fire station. But it's also near some very historic sites and a nice park - it should highlight those more.The rooms were reasonably good, but there were simple things which could have made them better. The lighting in my room was terrible. The bathroom had a combined bathtub/shower. The shower nozzle faced the shower curtain -- which was porous. The floor flooded every time I showered.The breakfasts were average. They served canned fruit. A nice hotel would serve fresh fruit.Again, the gym was ok and had all of the machines and weights, but just a few simple things could have made it better. Mats for floor exercises, towels, and water are so easy, but they weren't there. Come on folks -- a little effort would make it much better.So, overall, it was ok, but there were some easy things which could have made it better.",The Classic Hotel

The mattress is very comfortable so you can be sure of a good night sleep.The breakfast is average but decent. The coffee, though, is another story. I am very picky about my coffee so I wasn't that impressed.The layout of the hotel is rather complicated since it is the result of joining three different buildings, I was told.There was one set of towels which is weird since there were two of us. Also, the bathroom sink is rather low and small. Not enough space to arrange your stuff.The staff is very polite and always pleasant and eager to assist you in anyway possible.",The Classic Hotel

The minor nitpicks were key cards that would randomly stop working (although the reception were very patient and re-coded them promptly every single time) and that the clothes iron that we've asked for was dirty (someone burned something with it in the previous use) and we had to clean it before using.As a value for money, this place is pretty hard to beat.",The Classic Hotel
20,"Stayed for 9 nights on a business trip. Well, this must be the worse hotel for business travelers in Nicosia. I've been to Hilton, Semeli, Almond business suites, they all beat this hotel hands down.Lets start. Upon arriving there was no-one at the reception area. Frankly I missed it and went through, later realized that this small opening was actually the reception area. Staff at the reception area semi-polite, indifferent, no problem with me as long as they do what they are supposed to do.First impression of the room. It was tiny!!! Bathroom tiles were stained, tiles broken, wooden bathroom door broken. The metal lavatory ready to fall. Disgusting.The view was that of the back street, noisy (with windows closed of course), car honking, people shouting. There was a small S/M - sell all shop right outside the back of the hotel that added to the noise.Breakfast was average, little variety local tastes missing. Indifferent.One positive thing only (that's the two star rating, otherwise it would be zero star rating) the internet is above average in the room.This hotel is average (not good or great) if you are a TOURIST and want to be close to old town, ledras street (which was a 5 minute walk from the hotel) and old city center. For the same price try some other hotel nearby.I would NOT recommend this hotel when travelling on business. Would I stay there again? No way.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I like it. Room was clean. Location is very good and close to Lidra square and city center. I like the old town around the hotel. They have good and tasty foods. Staff is perfect. The only thing I didnt like, they took much time to bring back the laundery. But in general its very good hotel.",The Classic Hotel
40,"We stayed at the hotel just one night. The hotel staff is really excellent, especially the receptionist that welcomed us as we arrived and gave us lots of tips about the island. Breakfast is really good. Our room at the first floor was spacious and clean. The only negative side was our bathroom:- small sink- shower and water problems (temperature)We invite the hotel manager to try the amenities of the room, especially the bathroom in order to understand the needs.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The hotel is small with public spaces decorated in a modern and interesting way. I would dare to name this hotel ( in public spaces) - design hotel (there are some modern colourful sculptures in the lounge that I liked very much). The room is renovated and nice. Our room overlooked the small terrace in the ground floor that is the only place where one can smoke. With our window open, the smoke came up to our room, so beware if you do not like smoke and do not like air - conditioning. Also, another friend stayed in a single room that was overlooking the airconditioning machines' exterior and the roofs - not a nice view. Breakfast was very good and the staff overall kind. One small complaint: a lady in the reception, replied in english while we were speaking to her in greek, without explaining or apologizing for any difficulty with the language ( we were in a city with greek as the official language!). We finally found that she perfectly understands greek but just didn't feel like speaking greek at the moment.Last but not least, I need to mention that location is excellent. You can walk in the old town in cafes, restaurants in 5 minutes and there are taxis and bus very near.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Stayed in the Classic hotel in August 2015 and was pleased to find that the air conditioning works really well (very important in Nicosia in August).The hotel offers good value and we were a family of four with a 12 and 9 year old, staying in adjoining family rooms.We were in rooms 231 and 232 which a good for families as they have their own little corridor with a third door that you can look and keep the other two doors open to create a mini apartment and be close to the children.The only thing the hotel lacks is a grand entrance lobby, however what it lacks in grandness it more than makes up for in style and attention to detail. It's situated inside the old town walls of Nicosia and all of the tourist sites of the old town are with easy walking distance. The plus side of this is that everything is in easy reach but the downside is that the buildings are smaller and older. The classic has got round this by making the lobby contemporary and with various works of art and holistic poems on the walls. It is nicely done and once you find your way around there are several gems to this hotel.It has a pretty little internal courtyard, the art works in the reception area, it has a reading area between the reception and the bar which is quirky and had quite a few books and magazines on offer to read in a peaceful area.The bar is large and contemporary and serves food from 12 until midnight, which what looks like a fabulously stocked wine cellar chilled at 16 degrees. It has a separate a la carte restaurant, which is also where breakfast is served, which has a great looking menu although unfortunately I didn't get to try it.When we arrived we were personally shown to our rooms, and a few minutes later fresh fruit and water was also brought up. The service was impeccable, with nothing too much trouble. For example the tea making facilities in the room only had coffee and peppermint tea; but after asking if there was any ""English"" type of tea, they brought up some English breakfast tea and a small pot of milk to go with it. I also asked about the mini bar fridge which was locked.. They gave me a key so I could then use the fridge as a store for my own family's water supplies (important in Nicosia in August heat).Our rooms were not small (not large either), but nicely decorated with a contemporary feel. They had good bathrooms which nice quality finishes such as tiles and stonework. One room had a large stand in shower and the other had a bath with shower over.Breakfast was marvellous. Served from 7am until 9.30 it is self service with a good choice of cooked breakfast items, cereals, croissants, pastries and cakes as well as juices and fruits and coffee, tea, etc. The honey and jams were fantastic quality and none of us thought the breakfast would be anything like this good.I'd definitely stay again for all the reasons listed above, and primarily because of all the attention to detail and the excellent staff. It's not 5 star luxury but neither is it tacky and cheap. It's a good quality mid range hotel with great facilities and service at a good price. We paid 140 Euros for 4 for us in two adjoining family rooms with breakfast in August 2015.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Went to Cyprus for visit friends, I got this hotel at first because it was near their home. Found this Hotel to be great.It offered a fine restaurant which served great breakfast for the guest. Staff very helpful, friendly. Its about an hour from the airport, in Larnaca. It is very near the U. N post dividing Greek side and Turkey side of Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Stayed at the Classic hotel while visiting Nicosia. We arrived in the middle of the night, to find our spacious room waiting for us. The staff were attentive and friendly, especially in helping me locate my bag though the airlines! Breakfasts were good. Convenient location to the sights of the old city!",The Classic Hotel
40,"This is a modern Hotel at the below € 100 for BB category.My overall impression is that I received in services what I paid for: Indifferent service,a modern room made of cheap materials,a so so breakfast where cost of goods determined the offering.No one tried to make the extra mile,be it a local delicacy on the breakfast buffet,or attentive service.Will I go back? Most likely not.Yet,at the price the room was offered I can't fault it.I will just forget about it the moment my plane lifts off from Cyprus.",The Classic Hotel
50,"The Classic Hotel is very centrally located - just a couple minutes walk from the Nicosia central bus station and from the very ""happening"" Lidra Street. But that's not the only good part. The best part is the extremely warm, friendly and helpful staff who went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and memorable. The breakfast spread is varied and generous. The rooms are small but comfortable n clean.",The Classic Hotel
50,I decided to stay in this hotel due to the good reputation from other reviews. I was not disappointed! The establishment is centrally located and close to the green line. The old city walls are easily accessible and the main bus station. The hotel staff service was the best I witnessed in Cyprus tending to all my needs. The hotel even has a gym with beautiful views of the City (take your camera and take snaps). Very generous breakfast with great selection of local and international foods. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby - highly recommend!,The Classic Hotel
30,"I stayed at the classic during a work trip and it was an ok experience. The room is very clean but was extremely small. Also, the layout of the rooms feels like it's a maze. The hotel doesn't have any facilities but its location is great next to Ledra street. The food offered there was also delicious. It was ok for a business trip but wouldn't have stayed there is I was on vacation.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Situated near the town. Good size room, clean, but no view. Shower good size but bathroom a little small overall. Good variety of breakfast but cold meats, cheeses and yogurts not in any coolers and room was quite warm. Staff need to be more professional and not stand around chatting. Price a bit expensive - 90 euros for double room with breakfast. Does need some repairs around hotel - handrail near reception loose, paint peeling of walls.",The Classic Hotel
50,"A friend booked this hotel on my behalf for an overnight stay in Nicosia. A standard room was better than I needed for my stay. The location is ideal for visiting the old city, only a few minutes walk from both the bus station and Ledra Street for shopping or crossing to the northern part of Nicosia. Other tourist attractions are close by too. I found the hotel staff to be very helpful and informative, anticipating my questions before I'd even asked. I was shown to my room by a member of staff who carried my bag and explained how to use everything such as air conditioning etc. The room was small, but had everything I could want, including a desk and very comfy couch, even a covered patio type area. Great shower with toiletries and the bed was so comfortable. I'd definitely use this hotel again for any future trips. I did have a small problem using the WiFi, but I think it was my device acting up, as it eventually started working and was fine after that.",The Classic Hotel
50,We stayed here on the recommendation of the taxi driver who took us from Erhan airport the day we arrived. He heard it was good & it was easier for him to pick us up from there for the return trip to the airport at the end of the week. It is an excellent hotel with very helpful staff. The room was clean & comfortable with a large bathroom! It's an easy walk to Ledra St.,The Classic Hotel
40,"This is my second time staying at the Classic Hotel and it has become my first choice when staying in Nicosia. I was there for five nights this time and it did not disappoint.A series of older buildings, five I would think, cobbled into a boutique hotel with partial stairways running seemingly everywhere sounds a bit odd. But it works to put a modern, rather fashionable feeling hotel into the city centre without tearing things down and building anew.Add a full breakfast, included in the room rate, and you have a nice place to stay at a fair price, modern but somehow homey too.If I were in management, I might choose fluffier towels for the rooms and change from the squeeze bottle soap dispensers in the bathroom to more conventional 'amenities', but I will be back again when I am next in Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
40,"This fairly small city hotel suited our needs well. The staff were friendly and very helpful. It is situated in a convenient part of the old city and not far to walk to restaurants. They let us keep our rooms until late afternoon as we had a late flight out of Larnaca, which was really helpful and much appreciated.",The Classic Hotel
50,Located within the venicuan walls in the old city sector.Very convenient location just nearby to a lot of restaurants and shops. Friendky staff and nice ckean rooms.Small but good place to stay.In the hotel there is a nice and cozy restaurant that operates with local clients and good dishes.,The Classic Hotel

40,"Not the most luxurious of hotels, but modern, clean and very convenient for both the business visitor and the short-stay tourist. The staff's attitude was impressive - welcoming, quick check-in, fast service and good with advice and directions. Late check-out was no problem and the staff were happy for me to make use of the quiet lounge to work in for as long as I had to wait for a ride to catch a very late flight. Perfect English, as one would expect on the Greek side of the border. A good breakfast, comfortable bed, good internet connection and a pleasant restaurant, though with a limited menu. A short walk to the main shopping and business areas and close enough to the old city, parts of which are now being renovated. Neither quaint nor fashionable, perhaps not the place for a longer holiday, but certainly good for a shorter stay.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Right by the bus station, this hotel is perfectly situated just minutes walk from the main shopping streets. Plenty of great places to eat and drink very close by including the hotel bar.Our room looked into the internal courtyard and was large, comfortable and very quiet.The hotel manager responded quickly to my emailed requests and the front desk staff were very helpful.",The Classic Hotel
20,"The room was modern but very noisy because the windows don't close properly. Breakfast was average. Quite expensive actually. Location was not bad, close to the old city. The heating took a long time to heat up the room. Would try another hotel next time.",The Classic Hotel
30,"My wife and I stayed overnight at this hotel as she had Oncology appointments at Nicosia over the Tuesday and Wednesday, we live in Paphos, Cyprus.When I booked the hotel I explained the circumstances and asked for a quite, non smoking room, they said no problem.We arrived at the hotel, which is right opposite the Fire Station and close to the Bus Terminal, the receptionist was very polite, booked us in and showed us to our room.To say the room was small would be an understatement, it is without doubt the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in.The room was right on the main road, opposite the Fire Station, how they thought this would be quite is beyond me.We could not get the towel warmer to work, there was no plug for the bath and the sink leaked. We did go down to the bar for a drink, but could not find any available staff, same in the dining-room.We therefore had to go out into the town and found a restaurant on Ledra Street, quiet a walk. On our return we retired to bed, but on switching out the light we found there was a streetlight outside our room, this made the room quiet bright to sleep in. We also heard traffic noise till quiet late at night.We had someone in another room playing the TV very loud at about 2-00am, we reported it to Reception and he told them to turn it down, well done.The breakfast in the morning looked very nice, but unfortunately it was supposed to be hot but it was stone cold.When we checked out we did point this out to the Receptionist.I am afraid I would not stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it.",The Classic Hotel
50,"We were only here for one night unfortunately but thoroughly enjoyed our stay.We were upgraded to a big executive room without asking which added to the experience.Staff were all attentive and friendly and the location is perfect for seeing old Nicosia and crossing into the northern sector.Breakfast was superb, extremely varied.We hope to return one day!",The Classic Hotel
40,"We arrived by car, which was quiet easy. The hotel is in the walled area of the old city. The hotel doesn't have a car park, but you can park just around the corner (150metres) for €3 per day.The receptionist was very helpful and she took us to our room - the hotel layout is a bit confusing at first!The room was a good size with a large bed, the view however, was of the block just across the road. But it was well appointed, with large tv, safe and kettle.The. Bathroom was excellent! A large bath with whirlpool jets - lovely! It had a separate shower too.The hotel is about 400m from Ledra Street - right out of hotel, and immediately right, then a straight walk. Before you go there, go right out of the hotel and walk 100m to the division with the North. Old gun emplacements and sandbags left in situ - worth a look!You arrive at Debenhams on Ledra. Worth popping to the 5th floor for a cuppa and the view of the city, or go to the 11th floor observatory for €2 you get a 360 view.There's lots of bars and restaurants in that area. From there, the crossing to Northern Cyprus is about 300m. And worth it too - don't forget your passport.Breakfast at the hotel was a good buffet style with loads of choices of hot and cold. The restaurant looks very stylish and smart. It had a good wine cellar too!The one little disappointment we had was the bed linen. It was clean, but had a few holes in the quilt cover and sheets sewn where torn. I t just took the shine off what was a great hotel, in a great location. I'm probably too fussy!",The Classic Hotel

50,We stayed in this excellently located hotel for one night recently after a disastrous stay in a big chain hotel nearby. I can't praise the receptionist enough. Fantastic service. Rooms clean and tidy. We were fortune enough to be upgraded to a room with a Jacuzzi which was very kind. Breakfast was excellent with a huge choice. The waffles were great. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Highly recommended.,The Classic Hotel
40,"Great location and design. Staff were friendly, helpful and provided suggestions on driving routes and restaurants. Breakfast was huge and got the job done. Parking is very convenient, although they undersell this point on their website. It's only thirty yards away and very inexpensive.",The Classic Hotel

30,"Title says everything as well others wrote the same, this is very well located hotel in Nicosia with decent price (our deal was 60EUR/night). We did found some ants in toilet but nice lady from reception helped us solve the problem. Also, help from reception desk was nice in understanding where to go, with 2 very good restaurants recommended. Room was small but enough to enjoy privacy.I would give easily 4 points to this hotel, but somehow their attitude towads breakfast create this review as average.First of all, to put so many things just because you want your table look diverse, doesn't make any sense, if people are not eating this. One decent thing was sweet warm pastry.Don't call orange juice something that is pure chemical waterish liquid.I saw lot of wasted food there on plates of other customers, do something about it. Specially point of attention goes to coffee (horrible) and waffles. For this you need to ask to be made by personnel. It is big, dry and looks nice only on photo.Engage someone creative for breakfast and cut your offer for 50%, name your food/drinks properly and your will have more happy customers. You are welcome!",The Classic Hotel
30,"Lack of soundproofing made it difficult to sleep. The only real bad point is that the walls between the bedrooms, which are not soundproofed in any way. From our room we heard the TV and the mobile phone of the people next to us. We also could hear the noise from the bar-restaurant which was located at the ground floor of the hotel.The breakfast was almost poor. Very limited.The wifi was not working.On the other hand the staff was great and the location of the hotel excellent.Would we stay there again or advise others to visit? No we would not. That is because the walls are paper thin and the area has lot of noise and the limited breakfast.Sleep quality: 1/10",The Classic Hotel

40,"This is a series of old buildings extensively renovated and converted to a modern hotel with a bit of the quaint feeling remaining. It feels a bit like a rabbit warren at times, with half flights of stairs up and down to accommodate different floor heights in the different buildings that were joined to create the hotel; one odd development of this is that it is a three storey hotel with a two story elevator.The staff are very accommodating and helpful.Some of the good points: very nice buffet breakfast with some interesting treats, mini-bar contents included in room price (soft drinks only supplied and not replenished during stay), great bathroom with luxurious tub and nice marble work.But watch out for the low doorways in this old building if you are over 6 feet / 1.9 m. I also found my room had good task lighting, but poor area lighting.",The Classic Hotel

40,"I stayed here for three nights in late October - a good time to visit Cyprus temperature-wise. The Classic was recommended by a project coordinator and I can see why. It's a short walk from the city centre and is very clean, quiet and convenient. First impressions - they telephoned me as I was leaving London to check that I was intending to stay that night which is understandable but since there is a cancellation fee is that necessary? A warm, typically friendly, reception and a warren of a building! I don't think that I ever felt that I knew my way around the building with confidence. A large, modern, room facing a very quiet side street with excellent sound-proofing and efficient blinds and curtains. A large bathroom with a jacuzzi - better than home! A substantial and varied breakfast which, together with wi-fi, was included in the 115 euro/night cost. My colleagues stayed in single rooms which were much cheaper but also well-received. A sign on the door identifies the Classic as one of the 'Great Hotels of the World' - I find that surprising - it has to be one of the best in Nicosia, but in the world? Anyway, if and when I return to Nicosia I'll be sure to, stay at the Classic.",The Classic Hotel
50,"I spent a week at The Classic Hotel in October, a business trip, travelling solo from Dubai.On arrival greeted by a delightful lady, Andrea...and within moments complimentary refreshments were in front of me.. and the superb service continued for the entire week.Great selection of food, generous portions and an astonishingly sophisticated wine list. Who knew Cypriot and Greek wines were so good??This hotel is more of an elegant Boutique hotel, modern, clean lines and unfussy.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who are extremely kind and attentive. They appear to genuinely care and always took time to talk to me.To be honest I am struggling to think of anything negative to write. I think my overwhelming memories of Cyprus will be the humble sincerity and friendliness of the people here. Hospitality seems to run in their blood. a beautiful island and when I come back, I will definitely return here.",The Classic Hotel

30,"I stayed for one night in The Classic on business 22Sep.The hotel was pleasant enough but some simple comforts were disappointingly not provided.I arrived at around 9:30pm to find the hotel reception serviced by one staff who after attending to each client took them to their rooms, and thus left us waiting for a few minutes. She pleasantly apologised for keeping us waiting, and proceeded to take me to my room. I don't think that's necessary.The room is clean and nice enough.A kettle is provided with only herbal teas, no coffee, no English breakfast. I requested this, and someone brought some.Other things missing: only one power outlet - which was set in a cupboard area, far from the bed or desk, no clock in the room, no shower cap, no hair conditioner, no shampoo, no hand cream, no stationery, no slippers or bathrobe, no tissues.I would miss all these things if I stayed here for longer than one night.",The Classic Hotel
30,"This hotel is well located for the centre of Nicosia - it's an easy walk to the old town, with its restaurants and bars. Staff were welcoming and the public spaces smart and well kept.There is limited parking at the front, but just behind the hotel there is a cheap car park which you can use and for which the hotel will re-imburse you the €3 daily charge if you keep the receipts.Our room was spacious (we paid for an executive classic) but simple. Plenty of room for two people to stay for a few days and not trip over one another too much. It had a fridge but no minibar - the fridge is much more useful, but the hotel describes the rooms as having minibars. There was a sofa and a coffee table, so there was room to spread out.The bathroom was likewise nice and big, with a jacuzzi bath and a large walk in shower. Someone in the hotel needs to look at how people actually use rooms, though, as the shower door opened inwards, requiring a very tight squeeze to access the shower itself. A stupid and very basic design flaw which no self-respecting hotel should permit. Try it when you are a bit overweight or pregnant. A smaller irritation was the fact that the shower and sink had soap dispensers, but the bath did not. The air conditioning in the room did not adjust (again, the hotel website says it does) and therefore one had a choice of being super-chilled or over-heated at night; we got up to switch it off in the middle of the night but we heard a fellow guest requesting a blanket, much to the hotel's bemusement. When guests are asking for a blanket in Cyprus in August, you might want to look at your air con thermostats.The buffet breakfast was pretty uninspiring and showed evidence of running down towards closing time, but we didn't starve.We paid just under €100 per night and didn't consider ourselves badly done by. Would we recommend it? Not whole-heartedly but it may well be good value for money, so see what you can get elsewhere for the same price. Would we go back? Probably not - it was the kind of hotel one stays in and forgets fairly quickly.",The Classic Hotel

50,"Very pleasant hotel, with extremely helpful and courteous staff. Rooms clean, welcome tray on arrival, air conditioning that worked and very comfortable bed. Excellent breakfast. Handy location, close to old part of city and border for Turkish-held area of the island. Nearby bus station (200m) for 2hr air-con bus trip (€7) to Paphos (airport) and other resorts such as Limassol. I left some clothes in the room and the hotel rang me, then posted the goods back to England. They could not have been more obliging.",The Classic Hotel
50,Go for it! Excellent in every way and minutes away from the nicest walking area in the old town. The rooms are also very big. It's a nice change from the stereotypical and repetitive big hotels. Enjoy! I highly recommend it. You will not regret it.,The Classic Hotel
40,"Clearly recommended, will come back. Stayed only one night but will book again in a couple of weeks! Perfect location, just a short walk from Ledra - just what we wanted! Stayed one night - two adults and one child, really nice room.",The Classic Hotel

50,"I would stay here again, over the other places I have stayed in Nicosia, because it had an included breakfast, included wifi internet, and the price was better than the competition nearby.With friendly staff at the front desk, our arrival, departure, and in-between questions were handled effectively.Short walk from the hotel to the border with the north.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Arriving at this hotel makes you feel very welcome! It feels like the receptionist expected you as she orders two welcome drinks per person. Hotel has nice, modern rooms with all the equipment you need. As it was very hot in Nicosia (40 dg Celcius), the airco (of which the temperature was regulated centrally) was not cool enough during the night. Nice tele and good and modern bathroom. Great breakfast buffet with choices of healthy foods also.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I stayed for 6 nights as part of a business trip. Location is excellent, just inside the walls of the old city. Easy walking to the pedestrian area, the archaeology museum, and to the North side. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms are OK size, worked fine for me as a single person. My refrigerator didn't work, and they offered to put drinks in their kitchen and get them when I asked. Not ideal, but I appreciated their willingness to provide a solution.",The Classic Hotel
50,"we stayed there from 6-june till 8-june ,and it was great. we arrived a bit early at the morning, so they gave us free breakfast, no charge, just to let us enjoy and relax from the flight.the rooms are very clean and spacious, with great bed and clean towels.,the staff give you the best service you need, on each question of taxi, or help with the safe.they also have a piano bar restaurant, with good atmosphere, and good food.the breakfast has a variety of foods, with nice people who brings you whatever you need.to summarize: I will definitely come back, great service, great hotel- very low price.",The Classic Hotel
50,"This is an excellent hotel very nearvthe old and new Nicosia. Just a few hundreds metres from the bus station , intervity service ( green buses)...Excellent staff , very helpful and always smiling...ready to help and attentive....the room was excellent...the breakfast was fantastic...I am a seasoned traveller and I can guarantee you won't regret staying at this hotel if you are a seasoned and discerning traveller.I will certainly stay at this hotel next time I am in Nicosia...",The Classic Hotel

30,"The Classic Hotel is nicely located close to the busy pedestrian area in the old city. The rooms are quite big, but the bathroom was a bit small. Hotel does not have parking, but within a short walking distance parking is available. The breakfast room is nice, but small. The service in overall is really nice. Small downsides: no pool, and the gym is really small (but has most likely the best views in the hotel).",The Classic Hotel
50,"Hotel offers everything a business traveller wants and needs, plus attentive service and understanding. Food great, location ideal, ambience welcoming. Absence of a pool is a negative, but everything else is well above par. Hotel was renovated 3 years ago, but you would not know it - spotlessly clean and well maintained unlike mainy others in Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
40,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel, which has been renovated to a high standard.The room was very nice,a small balcony(No view) the breakfast was good, as was the evening meal which we ate in the beautifully decorated bar.A pianist played.We would stay there again",The Classic Hotel
50,"We only stayed one night but it was a very nice experience. We would suggest for the traveller with a bit more time, to spend some time in Nicosia. It has heart that is lacking in other parts of Cyprus. The hotel is well located and staff well trained. The buffet breakfast had lots of choices and was good quality. Our room and bathroom was spacious, clean and quiet.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I chose the hotel for it's proximity to the border crossing… It was only 5-10 minutes walk to the border crossing, so very convenient and easy. Bathroom was small but modern, room was nice with large bed and a small outside courtyard (no view though but that didn't worry me). Breakfast was fine. Room service menu is limited but adequate. Staff quick to check me in and out. One staff member was way over friendly but she apologised later. For Cyprus it's the most contemporary accommodation I've seen. Also, only 5 minutes walk to restaurants/main tourist area/old town… very close.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The room was big and comfortable. It was probably an executive type room.The bathroom was big with a large bath. There was no shelf to put your stuff on, so we moved one of the small tables from the room into the bathroom.The room has a walk in closet but no drawers.Overall the hotel is nice in a good location and very friendly staff.",The Classic Hotel
50,"When I arrived, in the morning and then before check in time, I was given a light sweet, orange juice and a bottle of water, all that I needed in the hot weather of Cyprus! A nice room, very well located hotel, close to Ledras Street, the way that goes to the checkpoint between Greek and Turkish Nicosia. Excellent breakfast and, to crown the hotel as a brilliant choice, I had to buy something in Limassol and did not want to waste hours in the bus going and coming, let alone the time there to find the correct place. The receptionist here quickly called the store in Limassol and managed to organize the purchase through an express service that went there, bought what I wanted and brought to the hotel, with a reasonable price. Thanks for a perfect stay!",The Classic Hotel
40,"Very good location, in the center of Nicosia, the hotel is simple and clean. It is good for business or for a visit in Nicosia, the area nearby is busy and there are a lot of attractions and interests.",The Classic Hotel
50,"I've stayed in this hotel for two nights and I really enjoyed. The location of this hotel is perfect, withing walking distance to most attractions (including North Nicosia) and local restaurants. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They even recorded a greeting video and sent to China to me per my request to be replayed in my wedding ceremony. Really appreciated.Below is pro and con.Pro:1. Perfect location. Walking distance to most attractions including North Nicosia. Lovely local restaurants nearby.2. Very nice staff.Con:I can hardly find one.",The Classic Hotel
50,I spent a week in Nicosia and enjoyed staying at this hotel. Excellent location. The room was spacious and clean. The stuff was friendly and helpful (and i needed their help for renting a car in the last minute). Very good wireless network.,The Classic Hotel
40,"The hotel has a modern design with a clear appearance, even though the floors are a bit mazy. The surrounding was relatively quiet (as the fire brigade on the opposite side of the street did not come into operation). The room was not very big, but we missed nothing. The breakfast was excellent.",The Classic Hotel
50,"I really enojoyed staying at this hotel, although it was only for two nights. I am travelling a lot around Europe and this hotel was one of the best I have ever been. Very beautiful, newly reinnovated. I liked my room a lot and loved the decoration of the hotel, especially the reception area. I found the breakfast room very pleasant, the food and the service excellent. I consider the prices very friendly. Moreover, I appreciate our welcome by the reception, although it was 2.30 in the morning because of flight delay.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Great location, the hotel is located on the edge of the old town. The room was large, clean and comfortable. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The restaurant offers meals at fixed times, but there's plenty of places within a walking distance where you can eat if you'll miss a meal.If you have a penchant for wine you should try their wine bar - very wide selection of local and imported wines.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I had a 1 week business stay, running a course in the hotel's board room.Every one I met was charming, attentive, engaging and interested. The training room was just right for my small course and service was excellent.Restaurant availability was a little random...lunch wasn't available on 1 or 2 days but not a big problem as there are lots of eateries in town just 2 minutes walk.Would love to go back on holiday.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Not bad at all. Cosy, excellent breakfast, located in the very center of the city, walking distance from everything, friendly staff. Rooms could have been a bit larger though. Municipal parking just across the street.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Central, very comfortable, clean and modern décor and helpful staff. This was a good choice of hotel for the couple of nights we wanted to stay to explore Nicosia. Very good value, particularly because the delicious breakfast was included in the price. We would definitely return to this hotel and recommend it without hesitation,",The Classic Hotel
50,"Great location, friendly warm welcoming and helpful staff, value for money, blue wine bar had nice live music and delicious food, clean rooms with comfy bed and huge bathroom. Walking distance to ledra street and the crossing point. Kyrenia harbor is a must do.... Just cross to the other sIDE and take the kombos shared taxi and it half hour drive to the cute harbor. The hotel also helped in arranging a tour through a tour operator to troodos mountains which was really nice. Thanks classic hotel for a wonderful stay :-) as usual the comments on trip advisor helped us to make a fantastic choice and we had a fantastic time. I fell in love with cyprus and the Cypriots.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I selected this hotel for a one night stay on a business trip to Nicosia. It totally surprised me on every level. It was clean, the room was large, as was the bathroom with a whirlpool bath. Many 5 star hotels on Cyprus would be put to shame. Nice Wine bar and excellent buffet breakfast. Grabbed the evening meal deal at Euros 9.95 including a large glass of excellent wine. Would highly recumbent and definitely book it again when I need to stay over.",The Classic Hotel
40,"My wife and I were very pleased with this hotel. It was walking distance to all Nicosia attractions. Really in the heart of the city and very accessible by bus.The rooms were comfortable sized and everything was updated. We slept well in the comfy beds.The hallways are a bit confusing.Breakfast buffet was delicious .The hotel staff was very willing to help us with our many question. Went above and beyond to help us as best as possible, even to answer question about our stay in other cities",The Classic Hotel
40,"Located in downtown Nicosia, close to the bus station and the busy Ledras street. Rooms are spacious, clean and have all amenities: hairdrier, safe, sat tv, wifi and comfy beds. The only strange thing about this place is the presence of many levels, reached only by stairs. The lift only goes to the second floor, so if you get a room on the third, stairs are the only way to get there. The conference rooms are not easily accessible and yet again through many flights of stairs!Lunch and breakfast are very good, plentifull",The Classic Hotel
50,Modern tastefully decorated hotel with all the necessary facilities. Light and spacious dining room and bar. Very friendly and helpful staff. I left an important document on a table in the foyer by accident and they rang me and offered to send it on by letter. Bed very comfortable. Good wifi connection and space to work comfortably in room as well as accessible equipped IT space with printer. Very convenient location for Nicosia city centre.,The Classic Hotel
50,"The Classic Hotel is a small, friendly and stylish hotel in a convenient location in Nicosia. Friendly staff, simple yet chic decor and comfortable beds. What more do you need on a trip to the capital?",The Classic Hotel
50,"Great location, clean rooms, very friendly and helpful stuff, great value for money! Only problem might by that 3rd floor is not accessible by lift; however stuff is there to help you with your luggage.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Just stayed here one night on a trip to Nicosia. Found the hotel to be very clean, well appointed in terms of facilities. Very tastefully decorated, yet with a modern feel, the artwork in the lobby just around from reception are beautiful. Our room was very comfortable, huge double/kingsize bed and the marbled bathroom was lovely complete with jacuzzi which did get used and gave the impression it had been properly cleaned with regard to some of the bad press that Jacuzzi's get.The staff, well the young lady that greeted us on arrival could not have been nicer, just as were the house keeping staff and the guy that delivered the welcome appetiser and bottle of water.Breakfast was very good. Nothing over powering, but a good selection of hot and cold dishes.Would We stay here again......... Without a doubt!!!! 10/10",The Classic Hotel
40,"This was our 4th stay at the classic and we will be back as the location is great . .comfortable, good sized rooms, modern with a nice ambience. Another plus is the in house blue bar with life entertainment most nights and excellent..friendly service .",The Classic Hotel

40,"The rooms were very nice and spacious, but the bed was too hard for our taste. The staff were very polite and helpful.The location was good.It was good value. The hotel is opposite the fire station and a stone throw away from the old city, as well as Ledra Street and the Green Line.We would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to access the old part of Nicosia.Cathy and John",The Classic Hotel
50,"Our room was huge and the bathroom enormous. Fantastic breakfast choice - Fruit salad, Greek yoghurt, fried egg and bacon, custard tarts and Cyprus delights anyone! The Classic is situated close to city walls and Ledra Palace Hotel Crossing Point. Lovely staff, very good value.",The Classic Hotel
50,"First, full disclosure: I work in a four-star downtown Chicago hotel, so I know a bit about the hospitality industry. The Classic Hotel is my choice of a comfortable place to stay that's within comfortable walking distance to major Nicosia sights if you're here on vacation and it appears to have a nice selection of amenities/services for business trips. No need to replicate what you can read in other reviews, but I can add that it's just two blocks to the major intercity bus station for nonstop, easy coach service to UNCESCO World Heritage sites such as Pafos and to other cities, which opens all sorts of possibilities. Book a room and then get on with it. :-)",The Classic Hotel
40,"The location of the hotel is phenomenal if it is your first trip to Cyprus and you want to do all the usual tourist attractions. It is opposite the fire station and a crow's flight from the old city, as well as Ledra Street and the Green Line. Just turn right on Arsinois Street. It is also walking distance from the Levantis Museum.The room I got was reasonably large and the internet connection within the room was strong, which is great for streaming. The sheets were clean, the water pressure in the shower was good and there was hot running water (easily calibrated to suit your preference). There are a few English channels available (mostly news wires and Bloomberg TV), so you are better off entertaining yourself with Netflix if you don't speak Greek.The breakfast buffet selection is passable but not shabby. The hotel refunds you parking fees if you are driving since they do not have their own lots. This was a nice touch. Generally, the service is good and the decor is reasonably modern but don't go expecting the Hyatt standards. The business center is essentially two reasonably new desktop computers in a small room. No frills but it does the job if you aren't fussed.The only downer was that despite advertising spa and massage services, these were not available when I inquired since their (I must assume sole) therapist had apparently injured herself.",The Classic Hotel
50,Staff was very helpful and the hotel well situated in the Old City. Free WIFI in your room was a bonus. Breakfast was included and this was an excellent value based up the convenient location and modernness of the hotel.,The Classic Hotel
40,"Nice and friendly staff, my room was great, I loved it! Great breakfast, even too rich!!... you could find almost everything. it is centrally located in a quiet aera though and the city center is quite easy to be reached on foot. it was a business trip so unfortunately I had absolutely no time to try their SPA and the Blue bar with live music that looked both very attractive . hopefully on the next occasion!",The Classic Hotel
50,"Welcoming and Friendly Staff, Perfect Hotel with reasonable sized rooms, large bathroom and large bath, modernly and well decorated, clean. The Staff went out of their way to provide a room early which we appreciated after our long flight as well as to provide some water and fruit. Will definatley stay at The Classic Hotel again when next in Nicosia",The Classic Hotel
50,"This hotel was completely renovated in 2010, and feels like it was just done in 2013. Very modern, bright, clean and attractive. Quiet, comfortable bed, good lighting, huge bathroom and walk in shower. Free WiFi, free use of hotel's two computers, excellent buffet breakfast, complementary drinks in room fridge. Very attentive and accommodating service throughout. We had an excellent dinner (pasta) in their wine bar (Blue). Perfect location for exploring the Old City. No parking at hotel. Walking distance to the Ledra St border crossing or even to the Ledra Palace border crossing - if you don't have a lot of luggage to drag.",The Classic Hotel
30,"Quite expensive, but nothing special. Nice staff, but small room with not comfortable bathroom. I did't like it much. Nice breakfast area and good choice of breakfast options. Close to the check point and pedestrian area; about 10 minutes. Watch out; the firemen' station opposite side ot the street; pray for the lack of fire in Nicosia... :-)",The Classic Hotel
50,"I recently stayed at the Classic while on Business in CyprusThe Hotel itself has very modern decor and very aesthetically pleasingThe rooms are modern and well decorated , with comfy beds and are of average room size. there was only a shower available , but i seldom take baths so this was not an issueFacilities in the room are on point,although TV Channels are mostly Greek, ,the buffet breakfasts would get a 3/5, there was a large variety , but the basics like bacon and eggs weren't freshly made which is a must for a 5/5 start to the day, the fresh grind coffee machine also seemed to be taking a bit of strain keeping up with the morning demand.The Wifi was quick and had signal through out the hotel, which made for good communication with loved ones at homeThe staff at the classic were perfect throughout my stay and made every effort to make my time their more comfortableThe Barman at the blues bar were always very friendly and welcoming,by day two they knew my drinks preference of a KEO and had it ready with a bowl of nuts before i had even sat down after a long day out.the Classic is within walking distance is the Vibey old section of Nicosia which is well worth the stroll.I would certainly choose the Classic when again in Nicosia",The Classic Hotel
50,"I was there in January 2014 on business for three nights.The hotel's location is fantastic, near to the old town and the bus station yet very quiet.I had to go into the northern part it is only 10 minutes walk to the crossing point. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful.It is a very modern furnished hotel and spotlessly clean, breakfast was really good with plenty of choice. The bar has an excellent choice of drinks and it can be comfortably lively.The bedroom was large and well furnished with a great bathroom attached. A large and very comfortable bed, I slept very well.The lift is small and it can be a bit "" jumpy"" but safe.All told a very nice place and I would certainly stay there again.",The Classic Hotel
50,"We booked this hotel, for our company conference, and it turned out to be one of the best choices ever. The facilities are excellent, everything that you need is literally in your hands. The conference rooms are fully equipped, and the internet connection works well either low floor or top floor. They have just installed fiber optic data transmission of 100 megabps so I believe no more words needed! The staff is highly helpful, polite and co-operative. The food banqueting was also very good. They even served us wine after our event which was not in the deal! If you will spend the day there, do not miss eating at their 59Knives restaurant. It's a flavor megatone must! Keep it up!",The Classic Hotel
50,"It was my first time in ""The Classic"" during a business trip to Cyprus in January. The hotel is very modern; location is beyond perfect, 5 minutes’ walk from Lidras Str., and 1 minute from the bus station. ""All areas free WiFi"" is a big + which we all enjoyed. Food variety was excellent and Chef Demetris did a great job.As for the hotel staff and management they are far beyond professional, hospitable, helpful and friendly. The general Manager Mr. Loizios is very capable, very resourceful person; there are no limits to his generosity and his knowledge of wine is incomparable. Christiana, the banquet manager, is a sweet yet very efficient young lady who spared no effort to make sure that we have a successful conference. She would also go out of her way in many occasions just to help you. I also value her efforts to make sure that all of her clients are equally satisfied ;) Glen, the reservation manager, is the most helpful person I have ever met; she was there for me every step of the way. She extended her help to me even after I left the hotel and up till this very moment. Her attention to details is remarkable and she made sure that our stay at the hotel would be a memorable and enjoyable experience. Yiota, the receptionist is a very kind, helpful person who would do anything to make you feel welcomed. You GUYS set the bar really high and I do appreciate each and every one of you.I am sure I will return again with family and friends.",The Classic Hotel
30,"Some of the reviews led me to expect something better. At the end of the day, this is a basic 3* business hotel. Rooms are well (but minimally) decorated, not too small, and spotlessly cleanOn the plus side, there are lovely artworks in the lobby, and the staff at reception were exceptionally helpful throughout.On the minus side, the restaurant was unwelcoming (a warning that 'smart dress' is required and no menu posted outside), the bar was not open for a pre-dinner drink at 6pm or a post-dinner drink at 11pm, by which time room service had also shut down. And the only openable bottles in the minibar contained only water. We also struggled to keep our room warm enough, because the air conditioning cuts out when the room is unoccupied.All in all, a perfectly adequate hotel, but not a great 'guest experience'.",The Classic Hotel
50,"It was my first time in ""The Classic"" during a business trip in Cyprus.It is a very clean new looking hotel, in a perfect location, so close to city center [5 minutes walk from Lidras Str], 1 minute from taxi station and with a free parking. Considering all the above, also price is turned to be really good and low.We also loved the ""all areas free WiFi"" and their parking policy and we had no complaint about anything whatsoever. What i would only need as an extra is really a set of slippers in the rooms.We really liked everything and would highly recommend it for a pleasant stay.",The Classic Hotel
50,"This quite small, minimalistic, with interesting design elements and modernly decorated hotel is a value for money one all the way down! Extremely helpful service, good variety of food for breakfast, quiet, clean, located very near the city-center, which makes it easy to walk to Northern part of Nicosia/Cyprus, if you need. Business center/meeting rooms free of charge for hotel guests. Wine bar, lobby and library - what else do you need for business (negotiations) and pleasure at the same time! Just enjoy and recommend it to your friends!",The Classic Hotel
50,"Very nice hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Within walking distance to the centre of the town, bus stop,shops and restaurants. Satying here make us feel we get more than we paid for. The quality and the variety of the breakfast was better than a breakfast in a 5 star hotel. We love it and we definitely recommend it.",The Classic Hotel
40,"This rather small and minimally and modern decorated hotel is a value for money one all the way down! Excellent service, big variety of food for breakfast, very quiet, very near the city-center - my only comment was that the plug was a bit difficult to reach - but there were 4 of them in the room, both for UK and European people!...",The Classic Hotel

50,Had a great 2 weeks stay in July. The General Manager Loizos is a true gentlemen. He gave us great infomation on places to visit and the history of the area. In addition his knowledge of wine is second to none. The room was very spacious and a true gem is the reastaurant which serves excellent food by the higly experienced friendly Chef and his team. I would only stay here when in Nicosia again and will be visiting n 2014. All the staff and facilities make this a great place to stay and use a base to explore. The close proximity to the border is perfect.,The Classic Hotel
50,I greatly enjoyed my conference/business stay in the Classic Hotel. Normally I dont enjoy ultramodern design but the Classic has established the right mixture between a modern design and a classy feel in their hotel. The food was great with the slight caveat that the coffee was not very impressive. Reception staff was outstanding and very accommodating.,The Classic Hotel
40,"I had the pleasure of staying for three nightsInteresting area closed to the border with the Turkish Cypriotic side.Lot of refurbushment outside to bring the area up to standards.The hotel is a gem. Rooms may be difficult to find on the first try You may have to have some help on the first attempt. My room was large and pleasant. Clean.No wifi-costs. Hotels still charging for internet connections should learn, Few TV channels. I missed my BBC news.Breakfast was excellent. I had dinner in the hotel two nights to a very good band and good food, as well as excellent local white wine.On the first night I was on my own. On the second nights, I was joined by a few more. I hope music lovers come in later.I would not say it was a Classic Hotel, but it was worth its money.I recommend taking a walk a round the neutral zone if you stay at the hotel",The Classic Hotel
40,"I stayed here for 3 nights for a wedding, the entire wedding party stayed here. I have no complaint other than I thought breakfast was very poor. I didn't eat dinner, do I can't comment on it, as I was only B&B basis. I found there could have been a better variety of hot breakfast and pastries available.The hotel staff are very helpful and I can't fault them, any request I asked was made.The hotel itself is very central and everything is walking distance. I took the bus from the airport to Nicosia bus station and then got a taxi which cost about 10 euro's. I had a day spare and took a taxi to the hilton to sunbathe which cost about 10 euro.If your looking for a central boutique hotel to stay, then I would recommend this, but as I previously stated the breakfast was very poor.. The other guests of the party also thought the same.",The Classic Hotel
40,"A lovely hotel. Great location in the old city and close to the border crossing. Very welcoming check in. Watermelon and a bottle of cold water were delivered to our room a few minutes after check in!The hotel is a few mins walk to Ledras Street and some of the other attractions in old nicosia.The room was very modern and spacious. great power shower and A/C.The breakfast buffet was lovely.All in all, a great stay!",The Classic Hotel
50,"Picked this hotel for an overnight in Nicosia. The location is convenient for walking around the old city. Friendly welcome, relaxed atmosphere, comfortable modern room, clean bathroom with efficient shower, good breakfast although a little sparse on bread choice. Nice ambience in the public rooms, very good value, would use again.",The Classic Hotel
50,"it was great... especially the wine bar, really tasty food and great staff.also the location helps a lot. for sure i will prefer it again. the parking place is not so good because you can""t find in front of the hotel the hole day so you use a private parking only one minute far away but the staff there is not so polite....",The Classic Hotel
40,"This hotel was a real find..... I happened upon it by chance. It is so centerally located, just inside the old city walls and very close to the city center. The hotel is modern, the walls are lined with contemporary sculptures and meaningful poetry. The breakfast was most impressive.... much better than much more expensive hotels I have stayed at. The cost of my room was so competative for a city center hotel, very clean and there was wi-fi available, free of charge throughout the hotel. This is a must stay hotel if you are visiting Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
50,"This hotel is great. All the staff from the manager down were excellent and always willing to help. The location is ideal for the centre of town and although parking can be a problem outside the hotel there are small parking areas just round the back for 3 euro for 24 hrs,(bargain). Rooms are very well finished although our room did not have tea making facilites. Outside the gym is a flat roof ideal for sitting on and within 30 mins of asking ther were four chairs made available for us. Only one downside for me was the live music. It can be very loud if you sit in the bar area but this is a personal thing. If you are in Nicosia for business or pleasure, stay at the Classic, you cannot go wrong. Wonderful stay, thankyou Classic.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Beautiful hotel, great staff. Lovely rooms for a great price! Decent breakfast included in price too. However, parking was a slight issue and ended up paying 6 euro for the night to park 5 mins down the road. But, a beautiful stay nevertheless.",The Classic Hotel
40,nice modern and design hotel close to the city center with a good breakfast the only less good thing is the noise in the street but if you ask a ask a room not facing the street may be you sleep well. If you rent a car you have a lot of space to park in front of the Hotel.,The Classic Hotel
50,"I liked the hotel very much. The personnel were very kind, breakfast was very nice and delicious, and room was clean with enough space. It is located in the heart of the city and near the bus station, very useful if you do not have a car.The only I had was internet connection in my room; I had to come to lobby for internet use.",The Classic Hotel

50,"Oly a stone's throw from the central bus station an excellent location for those few select individuals who, like us, try to avoid car/ taxi travel. Despite the central location it was nice and quiet and as my husband dislikes heat we were pleased the air conditioning work so well. WiFi connection was a bit dodgy and he had to stand near the door to get it to work. However a useful 'business' area allowed us to go on line to check all our bus connections.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Girlfriend loved the hotel as the bed was huge so we stayed there twice. The second time we had some complimentary sandwiches.Breakfast is a large buffet of cereals, fruit, Danish pastries, etc. Hotel itself is friendly.

Firstly, it is very conveniently located in the centre of Nicosia near all businesses, courts, banks etc. Secondly, it is in the heart of the old town so a great place to start your exploration of the area on foot during your free time.All the feedback I get from my clients is very positive both for the friendly staff and the cleanliness and the amenities of the hotel (wifi very important).What else is amazing, is the Blue Wine Bar, the restaurant that is located within the premises of the hotel serving excellent food and it probably has one of the most interesting and extensive wine lists in Nicosia. I personally had dinner with clients and friends (not a typical ""hotel restaurant"" but more like a cosy wine bar) on many occasions and I never felt disappointed. All in all, one of the best options to book for your stay in Nicosia.",The Classic Hotel
30,"I stayed at The Classic Hotel for two nights in late August. It is centrally located in the old city of Nicosia. The hotel itself is nothing special, but it has all the basic amenities, including free wi-fi connection. I was surprised by the size of the bathroom: it was extremely small. Breakfast is pretty basic but good, and the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.",The Classic Hotel
40,Very friendly staff. Breakfast on a good Level. The only things that was worst was the tv channels and the parking situation. The place was good to explore nicosia. The next time we will book again this hotel....,The Classic Hotel

50,"We arrived early to the hotel due to an early flight and the receptionist offered us the use of the breakfast buffet while we waited for our room to be ready! She gave us maps and suggestions of where to go for meals! I was highly impressed by all of the reception staff and their willingness to help us. The hotel is walking distance to ledra street, the main pedestrian shopping street, and the main bus station.The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. We had such good sleep in the dark quiet room that we decided to extend our stay whilst In cyprus. There was always parking available in the street out the front of the hotel for our hire car.I would highly recommend this hotel.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The Classic Hotel is one of those hotels that continually give you more than you expect. From quick replies to my advance emails asking questions to smart check in (everything already filled out and ready to go when you arrive - they hand you the key and you are done) and from interesting room design to a nice breakfast (particularly given the price), I was continually pleased with my stay. I was most impressed with the service - top notch. The folks at the front desk provided helpful information on everything from places to visit to transport - all done simply and quickly. The one oddity, as others have mentioned, is the building layout - and the windows - which often look into a small open area across from other rooms or buildings. Not bad but just limited natural light. Of course, you are in Cyprus so you want to be outside anyway.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I stayed in the Classic Hotel for 2 days on business, and had a very comfortable couple of days. The hotel is really modern with clean, modern rooms, and a nice bar that has live jazz many nights of the week. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was good. It's a short walk (although through some dark streets) to the main shopping area of Nicosia and towards the Turkish sector.",The Classic Hotel
40,"We stayed here for two nights during a short visit to Cyprus before heading to Protaras. The Hotel is good, has the basics, is budget-friendly and is well located. The food is not very good but you can find better restaurants where to eat in the city, so it was not a big issue for us.",The Classic Hotel
50,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and I felt I had to send a review in this time. It is well worth a stay. Excellent value for money, the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The room is exceptionally clean and modern. You are just a couple of minutes walk away from the old city where there are numerous shops, restaurants, and coffee shops.",The Classic Hotel

40,"A great place! Within walking distance from the city center. The hotel is interstingly and beautifully decorated with contemporary art. Very friendly, gentle, caring and helpul staff. Rooms are comfortable and clean. The breakfast buffet is delicious with wonderful variety. It has free internet area with two computers and a printer-scanner. Enjoyed every minute.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Great location in the heart of the old city. Just 2 blocks to the main pedestrian thoroughfare. Lots of small shops and restaurants around. Hotel was modern, our rooms were a great size but with an unusable balcony. Very clean with a good hot breakfast buffet. Any needs and the front desk took swift care of them. More for business travelers as there are no resort type amenities. I would stay here again.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Stayed here for 3 nights with work. Very convienient location, rooms are as described on the website and a great breakfast at a reasonable price whats not to like. You can litreally walk into the other half of Nicosia within 5 mins. Air con a must if you are travelling here in the summer.",The Classic Hotel

I was never at this place before....But I will tell you, this hotel gave me the opportunity to come back. And I will go back there.Nice personel, quiets rooms, great service...great...I will highly recommend this hotel.Not only because of the nice personal but because of their reliable service...The breakfast was also nice..A kind of Buffet Breakfast...",The Classic Hotel
50,"We stayed for 3 nights, there was a minor blip with our booking of the executive room where the first night was not available we stayed in a standard room which was nice enough. But the executive room was special,a lovely jacuzzi bath, massive bed and complimentary mini bar. The day we arrived we were given a welcome drink and lunch while we were being checked in which was a nice surprise. The staff are so nice, polite, kind and helpful and really enhanced our stay. It was my husbands birthday the 2nd day of our stay and we were helped to make a restaurant reservati for a restaurant in the area. My husband also recieved a voucher for drinks at the bar in the evening. We went out for a walk in the morning and on our return to our room we received two glasses of pink champagne and a cheese and fruit platter which was unexpected. The 3 nights at the Classic hotel really finished our holiday in Cyprus on a high.",The Classic Hotel

40,"Our group was greeted with a drink while waiting for check in. Hotel is clean, completely refurbished. The rooms are wonderful, but the corridors a bit of a maze, the bathrooms are a bit small but adequate. Food excellent, buffet style breakfast and dinner. Staff very helpful.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Very well located to the east of the old city, walking distance from anywhere there. Service was exceptional - great welcome, a light snack in the room complimentary, very helpful concierge. The rooms are modern and well equipped, but very oddly shaped and have some odd features - ours has a very small door for instance. Non paper flushing toilets bit pretty standard in Cyprus. Bar never seemed open and restaurant quiet but just out of season. All very clean and comfy. Not many English channels on TV. Free wifi.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I have stayed in Nicosia many times over the last 25 years or so but this is the one that I would heartily reccomend for anyone wanting nice spacious, well fitted rooms within easy reach of the many places of interest within the walls. My only criticism was that why is orange juice from a carton when Cyprus is full of trees with oranges falling off onto the pavements! I will definitely reccomend this hotel. Parking might be an issue if you have a car. We were lucky and able to park right outside.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The Classic is a fun place to stay. The most important point to make is that the staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the bar staff are great fun. The hotel is very well positioned close to the border and the lively area around Leonidou Street. The rooms are clean and spacious, albeit that you may find the design a little whacky if you are of an architectural bent. The breakfast is also very good. I would strongly advise taking your own soap and shampoo as the hotel provides soap dispensers in the showers that are either not refilled or simply unusable. I would go back to this hotel.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I was on a business trip to Nicosia and had stayed at The Classic Hotel. I found the hotel quite good, very neat and clean. The Hotel staff were quite friendly. The rooms were quite cozy and comfortable. The lighting behind the bed was a new idea and gave a very good look to the room. The breakfast was simple and good. This is a good hotel for business visitors.",The Classic Hotel
40,"This is a nice, clean hotel. I just love the staff! If you are on business this is the place to be. A clean cozy room, with a good shower. On the upper floor you will find a fitness room with an excellent view over the city. The breakfast is simple and the restaurant and wine bar good. Minor; This is a new hotel, but they should maintain it better. The sheets are worn-out and need replacement.",The Classic Hotel
40,Consider that Nicosia is not really a holiday destination : I would say the less touristic place in Cyprus. Those who come here plan just one day trip. As a matter of fact foreigners visiting Nicosia are mailnly for business purposes. I stayed in this hotel for the fourth time ( each time for a week ). I find it conveniently located near the city centre ( Ledra street is just 5 minutes walking ) offering simple but comfortable and clean rooms with a large bed where you can have a perfect rest; very quiet especially if you are given a room facing the internal courtyard. All the staff is very friendly an helpful at the same time. Just think that the hotel provide a free of charge fax service if you require it. Simply great considering that I often come across hotels ( by travelling around the world ) that charge you a fortune for that service ! Breakfast is rather rich and good quality. Finally I would say that this hotel offers an excellent quality/price ratio. I will definitely stay again.,The Classic Hotel
50,Welcoming staff and good size yet simple rooms. Would stay again on my next trip to Nicosia. The design of the hotel is really pleasant and everything of interest is a short walk. Nicest moment was the welcome coffee and snack after a long day traveling here.,The Classic Hotel
50,"Stayed here on business. Very nice staff, good modern rooms, comfortable bed. Struggle to find enough plug points which drives me insane but this is minor. Almost next to Holiday Inn but less than half the price and just as good. Have a nice bar downstairs with friendly staff. Did not eat here but no reason to think it would be poor. Only issue really was the layout, lift does not go any further than the first floor, after then it is a series of stairs to get to the room so be aware if stairs are an issue for you.",The Classic Hotel
30,"I had expected much as i have been staying at upper level hotels. But after seeing Nicosia, I would say it is a second class hotel after 1 few 1st class, which are also not that brilliant as in other countries. I got OK room, it was clean and small but Ok. I could stay here. It is not that wonderful as others write but you can compare it with Ibis type of hotels. It has good location but the building is very complicated specially when you need to go to rooms 3XX. Lift is less capable (2 persons only) and up to 2nd floor. So transporting suitcases was really problem. Once personel named Costa (around 70) was rude and was un-responsible as he refused to arrange table lamp very rudly but when I saw my angry tone, he came to the room. He was a heavy person and when he got down on the floor (to make the lamp) I couldn't lift him up easily when he wanted to get up.I hope the management gives him other job then single staff at night. However other 2-3 ladies were very helpful. Costa was also helpful I believe but he was little frustrated I guess, due to the responsibilities. Victoria was more helpful. It was anyway OK Ok.I had booked first by Expedia but had to cancel due to wrong dates. Then I booked directly with hotel because Expedia was giving higher price and Glen gave me better price. I would suggest to book directly with the hotel for better price and save their commision to Expedia.",The Classic Hotel
50,I stayed here for two nights on my first trip to Nicosia and have to say that for the price this is an excellent hotel in a very good location. Staff were friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived unitl we left. The buffet breakfast was also a bonus and very good start to the day. I will use the Classic hotel for my next stay in Nicosia.,The Classic Hotel
40,Stayed here 2 nights mid-Feb getting a bit of sunshine. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are fine and quiet. Breakfast was included on our tariff and a good start to the day. Free WiFi was much appreciated and it is a good connection speed. We didn't eat here but it seemed quite popular. Car parking is a bit hit and miss - there are a few places in front of the hotel but maximum stay is 1 hour between 09:00 and 13:00; fine any time after then. We left the car there all day whilst walking around the town and got away with it.,The Classic Hotel
40,"I stayed 5 nights in January 2013 for business and I must say that the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was comfortable and with easy access to the main shopping streets and old town of Nicosia. There are a few quirks which have been commented on previously. The fact that it is an amalgamation of older buildings does make navigating the corridors and stairs challenging at first. There was a wide range of food for Breakfast although the lack of fresh juice was strange given the propensity of citrus fruit on the island! Jazz and wine nights in the bar were welcome to give variety to my stay.Tours of the island and Nicosia were limited as it was off season, but I would recommend going to the tourist office near the hotel and taking the walking tour. Very informative.",The Classic Hotel
50,"unarguably, best choice in nicosia. located close to interesting historic sites and ledra, but in a much more quiet street and neighborhood. room is spacious, clean, and simply furnished with comfortable furniture; a safe is in a closet, in-room bar may be stocked upon request, and implements for making coffee or tea are available. strong water pressure, ample hot water, and heated towel racks in the bathroom. delicious breakfast buffet of hot and cold food choices, fresh fruits, and excellent individually brewed fresh coffee (or tea, or hot chocolate) are served in the spacious and relaxing '59 knives'. 'blu bar' has a stock of excellent wine and liquor, and with excellent live musical performers on selected evenings; not to be missed is ms. christina georgiu on saturday nights.free wifi is trouble-free in the room; computers and printer are also available in a quiet 'office' off a meeting/conference room.no smoking in public places; an outdoor court yard close to '59 knives' is used by some to have coffee with their cigarettes.staff are professional, courteous, gracious and very helpful. we arrived at 11:00 am not expecting to have a room until early afternoon; receptionist had us wait in the sitting room by the bar and served cold sandwiches and iced water. room was ready just as we finished refreshment. staff also helpful in selecting and arranging ride to the airport.hotel manager, mr l. maxoutis, is a very gracious host, always ready to assist us and to provide for any needs.had a great experience with the classic which we booked because our first choice could not accommodate us for the full duration of our stay in necosia.will be our first choice next time we come to cyprus.",The Classic Hotel
40,"This was a very unique hotel with split levels, confusing hallways, clean rooms, wonderful breakfast and very helpful staff. The location is central but still about 2 to 3 blocks from the pedestrian mall, shopping and good restaurants. Out the front door is busy all the way to the pedestrian mall. Out the back door (and a bit shorter distance) is deserted and dark most of the way to the outdoor pedestrian mall. But that's ok, because it's VERY safe in Nicosia. Our rooms were very clean, fresh and nice. The lobby was very pretty. The front desk gave excellent directions and restaurant suggestions. They even drove my car for me to find a parking spot because I was sweating bullets trying to drive through the narrow streets and stay on the right side of the street! Couldn't be any nicer. The parking lot is very close and cheap.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Maybe the best value for money hotel in town. Very friendly staff, very clean, simple rooms, lux breakfast, very nice decor, great location for downtown, and just opposite to bus station. I will stay there again for sure.",The Classic Hotel

50,"I stayed at the Classic hotel last week, on a 5-day trip to Cyprus. I was greeted in a friendly manner upon arrival, close to midnight, as my flight was late arriving- and within minutes of being shown to my room, a tray with a late night snack and water arrived, compliments of the hotel. That was just a beginning of a very relaxing stay. Free wi-fi and a plentiful breakfast, a quiet room and a bar ( Blue) that had live music and was a great venue to meet friends and clients in the evening. The hotel is an easy 5 minute walk to Ledra street, the shopping centre of the Old Town.Highly recommended!",The Classic Hotel
40,"The Classic is located in the old town of Nicosia. There is a large parking lot right across the street and sites within the old town are all within walking distance. The hotel is completely renovated and the rooms are stylish, as is the Blue Bar. We were also very satisfied with the quality of the restaurant, but many bars, nightclubs and restaurants are in the area for variety.",The Classic Hotel
40,I stayed here for 3 nights on a work trip and in this price range would stay here again. The hotel is clean and well kept. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and bathrooms a reasonable size. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel is convenient. There is nothing special about this hotel but it's fine for a few nights and if you don't plan on spending a lot of time in the room. It's not necessarily a place I would select for pleasure.,The Classic Hotel
40,"I stayed here one night on business. The room is very comfortable, but I was put in an odd shaped room at the back of the hotel and the room was fairly small. Decor is nice, modern and new. Breakfast is great, plenty to choose from! Location is very good.",The Classic Hotel
50,"The service was always with a smile!!!!! The room was spacious and comfortable - I really liked the big lighted flowery picture on the wall over the bed. The location absolutely convenient - 5 minutes from Ledra Street. The breakfast is very tasty with a variety of choices. I only stayed 3 nights (Synday, Monday, Tuesday) and I didn't have the chance to enjoy the special nights with music at the bar of the hotel. I really recomend it.",The Classic Hotel
50,"The Classic Hotel was an outstanding oasis in Nicosia. We had room #227, which was extremely comfortable, clean and quiet with a lovely renovated marble bath. After a busy day of touring, it was so nice to return to the room, freshen up and then enjoy a happy hour in the garden courtyard with wine from the hotel’s wine bar. The location was superb for walking to Nicosia’s sights and eating in nice restaurants. What makes the restaurant extra special is the exceptional service of the hotel’s staff that did so much to help us have an excellent stay. Whether it was offering complimentary sandwiches upon arrival, two computers for internet access, making dinner recommendations and reservations, and a late check out on our last day, the staff was so accommodating. Glen Markidou, the reservations officer, is to be commended because she was great with email correspondence and assisting us with changes in our reservation. Without a doubt, I would recommend the Classic Hotel to any traveler.Tips: We had a day trip to St. Hilarion Castle and Bellapais on the north side using Bellapais Taxi. I would highly recommend this day trip. I would not recommend Zanetto’s nor Pyxida Fish Tavern, but would go with the hotel’s staff recommendations instead.",The Classic Hotel
50,I would summarize that this lodge is the best full service hotel for guests in Nicosia. The classic has the lowest rates so we chose it as being the best and we were not disappointed. You take a big chance paying a low price at a lodge for a first time - and you never really know what you are going to get for a room but ours was luxury. We were in town for three days and getting married at town hall. Three other couples had horror stories and told us we were lucky that we found a good hotel - so i recommended the Classic to them and now to you. You don't have to complain to get a good room or good service - they shower it on you when you walk in the door.,The Classic Hotel
50,The hotel defines a boutique hotel. Not a huge intl chain but personalized and a staff that is friendly and always ready to assist and provide information. They are in a great location - walking distance to most sites in the city - and a 2 minute walk from the main bus station.,The Classic Hotel
40,"The Classic Hotel is well located in the old part of Nicosia, and is within walking distance of many interesting buildings and museums. It's also not far from the border between the Greek and Turkish parts of the city. The room we had was comfortable and generally well appointed. Its only deficiency was the smallness of the bathroom, and especially, of the shower, which was so narrow and awkwardly shaped that neither of us could achieve a comfortable shower (as we are both slim people, 100 and 140 lbs, respectively, this is a point worth recording). It seemed that in this case, the bathroom had been added as an afterthought to make the room ensuite, as no rational architect would have designed such an arrangement. Friends who were staying at the same hotel at the same time had reasonably large and commodious bathrooms--so if you make a booking at the Classic Hotel, be sure to specify that you want an adequately sized bathroom and shower. In general, the interior layout of the hotel is a bit odd, with staircases going off in various directions from the same level, and it was confusing for the first day or so, until we at least figured out the most convenient route from our room to the lobby and to the rooms of our friends. The hotel staff are extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful. When we mentioned--speaking to our friends, who had met us in the hotel lobby--that our checked baggage hadn't arrived with us, so we were lacking toiletries, etc., the young lady behind the desk presented us with toothbrushes and other necessary items (for which there was no charge). The staff are also fluent in English and tolerant of our efforts to speak Greek. The hotel provides a fine breakfast buffet, including, in addition to the usual items, a variety of fresh and dried fruit. Our room was reasonably priced at 110 euro per night (breakfast included). However, we were charged 2 euro for a 1.5-litre bottle of water that was available at the little shop around the corner for 35 cents.",The Classic Hotel
40,"Clean, comfortable, with attentive service. The business centre could be located somewhere more spacious and discreet so people who need to work from a laptop could fit in without having annoying children on youtube creating a mess. I also feel this hotel could put a guide to using the aircon in the room booklet - it is centrally controlled from reception.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Excellent, most frienly and helpfull service. Great breakfast included.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I travelled to Nicosia on my way from Paphos to North Cyprus and stayed at the Classic Hotel for one night. I was very well impressed with this hotel.Staff at reception was friendly and helped me in understanding what were the highlights of the city I could see in my limited time. I was lucky that it was sunday and I could park my car right in front of the hotel door (in working days you are only allowed one hour parking in that street but there are 2 public parks nearby).My room was huge and decoration extremely tastefull. Bathroom was the downside, I had only seen such a small space in a boat, but shower was ok.Breakfast was quite good too.In overall it was an excellent value for money. I have stayed in lots of 4 star hotels that were less confortable than this small charming hotel.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Highly recomended...Hotel is in an excellent location, close to restaurants and shops. Very convenient to public transportation.Rooms very nicely done. Large room with sitting area and large bathroom. Welcome fruit plate was a nice touch. Getting to the rooms was interesting as the stairways look like a maze. Boutique quality hotel with modern, off the wall decor.Breakfast had a lot of variety. Would stay there again.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I arranged this hotel my guests and the photographers of my wedding. I booked 3 rooms for them. In the end we needed an extra one. The reception desk arranged for everything my guests wanted for their rooms at no time and at a very good price. Our guests were really impressed and pleased with their stay.They all spent 3 days at the hotel.Location is just great for anyone that wants to spend a couple of days and walk around Nicosia.Prices are great. You get more than what you pay for.Unfortunately that is all i can write. I tried to get as much information as i could from my guests. They were very pleased, they walked around the streets of the old town and the shops of Nicosia and they were impressed with the cleanliness and the modern renovated rooms of the hotel.",The Classic Hotel
50,"I stayed at the Classic on recommendation this time last year, and enjoyed it so much I stayed there again this time round. My friend informed me of its perfect location in the heart of Nicosia, clean, modern, air-conditioned rooms, combined with unbelievably helpful staff, and his recommendation certainly didn't disappoint.The breakfast is plentiful and very tasty (I am a particular fan of the warm pastries that compliment the full english/continental offering every morning!), and the room service food was again, top notch. In terms of location, there isn't really anywhere better, and the staff (all spoke perfect english) were very helpful in helping me with transport each day, as well as giving tips on where to visit etc. Together with the business centre, computers, free wi-fi, and adjacent wine bar, it made for a brilliant hotel experienceI read some reviews moaning about the hair dryer. I used it each day, pulled up a chair to the perfectly positioned mirror, and dried my hair - no issue! The only slight downside personally is the gym is perhaps a little basic, but by no means does this tarnish what is an otherwise fantastic hotel, in a fantastic city, in a fantastic country.Thank you Classic and all the staff! Look forward to seeing you again next year!!",The Classic Hotel
20,"We stayed for business only for one night but it was enough :)The Hotel is located on an old building bat not all the rooms were completely renovated . Some of the door crossbars are still the old one.. No business center, unless 2 com into the corridor..the rooms are not in the same size and the 35 square meters that we were expected for, were much lesser. the mini-bar was empty and locked(!)The rooms are built in labyrinth ways.We had tried this time an alternative option for staying in Nicosia but we were wrong.Nevertheless some good points:- a good breakfast- nice deco in the rooms",The Classic Hotel
50,"It is some years since I had to visit Cyprus and the Classic had been transformed since my last visit, in fact I hardly recoginsed the hotel it had changed so much. For the better I must add. The comfortable rooms now have a modern look and the rather drab bar at the front of the hotel has been transformed into the Blue Bar. I was tired after an all day meeting and had to be up early for another meeting before I returned to London in the afternoon so it was nice to be able to eat a well prepared meal in such pleasant surrounding and, as it was wednesday, enjoy an evening of live jazz music. I did not venture to the Gym and although there was a large choice on the breakfast buffet I just took a pastry and cup of teas to business centre as I had some emails to deal with. The Classic in centrally located so everything in Nicosia is nearby and as it is a city centre hotel there are no sea views, but it is a great place to stay if you are there on business and looking for good value.",The Classic Hotel
50,"I have stayed at the Classic Hotel twice now (on business) and I have to say that I can't rate the place highly enough and I will definately be returning for future trips. The staff are extremely welcoming and friendly and on my most recent trip I was presented with a plate of fruit and cheese in my room after I had checked in - a really lovely touch after a stressful journey!The rooms are quite, clean and comfortable. They have been refurbished to a very high standard with high quality fixtures and fittings - the only negative here is the workmanship in the bathrooms which is sub-standard (unpainted wood on some surfaces that are almost 'out of sight', poor sealing on shower trays, low quality grouting etc) and this is a shame because the fixtures and fittings in the bathrooms are very high quality - it doesnt detract from the bathrooms, but it is at odds with the 100% quality feel of the bedrooms - different contractors perhaps? Still, its nothing that couldnt be remedied relatively easily if the hotel chose to.The air conditioning in the rooms is quiet and effective, rooms are very clean, wifi works well and breakfast is plentiful with more than ample choice (fresh fruit, pastries, cakes, cold meats, cereals, hot dishes, yoghurts etc - what more do you need?!).Location is perfect - on the edge of the old town and a very short walk to the modern shopping area in Nicosia.So in summary, friendly, quiet, clean, comfortable, great food, great service and competitive price when compared to other hotels in this bracket on the island (although all hotels in this bracket are not exactly cheap) - what more do you want?! I will look forward to returning later this year!",The Classic Hotel
50,"Stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a weekend. Rooms nice and spacious, clean. Breakfast is good for a city hotel and staff all great.",The Classic Hotel
50,"We had a long bus ride up from Larnaca and were happy to find a non-smoking hotel with good AC and comfortable rooms. The reception crew was friendly, warm and welcoming. Some of the art is tacky but the place had a warm feeling of home to it. The deals they give you at the desk are amazing - so much that I will be doing more sight seeing from Nicosia if i can get a few more days off from work.You have to be very very careful when booking a hotel in Nicosia - as they are very competitive and sometimes I dare say a bit boastful. When we found the Classic, our prayers were answered. If you are patient and wait a few minutes the staff will spend some time to show you were to go around town. Everything is nearby and withing safe walking distance.",The Classic Hotel
20,"My partner and I only spent one night in this hotel and I am really glad that it was just one night.First of all positives... Great central location, not too difficult to find, service pleasant, breakfast... well certainly something to choose from, hallway looks nice and inviting.As for negatives, the rooms are certainly smaller than presented on the photos. Never ever agree to stay in any room with its window outlooking the street.We stayed in the room on the third floor. I am not a light sleeper, but the noise from the street was horrendous and it kept waking me up all night. I ended up using earplugs for the first time in my life. One would think that a decent hotel would invest in sound proof windows! Secondly, the air conditioning did not work and despite the hot weather, it was blowing even more hot air. In normal circumstances, I would switch the air conditioning off and open the window, but in this case opening the window would have been a complete disaster due to the noise from the outside. When I rang the reception, I was told that the air conditioning wasn't working in the whole building and they needed to change the whole system, so if you want to stay in this hotel in the summer, better make sure that the air conditioning is working. Now on to minor things, the wash hand basin in the bathroom was a miniature and there was no shelf to put my cosmetics on. Oh, and the hairdryer is in the cupboard, drilled to the bottom with a short cord, so I had to kneel on the floor when I was drying my hair. Bizarre.Bottom line, if I ever come to Nicosia again, I will definately not be staying in Classic Hotel.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Had to be back in Nicosia for 4 days and stayed at the Classic hotel, again. It was nice when the person at the reception recognized me with a ""welcome back"".The room was nice, updated and comfortable. The location is excellent, right next to the old town and a nice stroll from the main shopping at Makariou Avenue. Breakfast buffet in the morning is plentiful. I stopped by the Blue Bar in the lobby for the first time one night, nice ambiance and live music.People ask me why I don't try other hotels when I'm in Nicosia- why take the risk if all my experience at Classic Hotel have been so good?",The Classic Hotel

10,"We arrived at this hotel in the late afternoon after a sweltering summer's day walking around Nicosia. All we wanted from our rather expensive pre-booked hotel room was a cold shower. Alas, this was not to be. First we had to wait at reception for 20 minutes for no apparent reason- we were simply ignored by reception staff. Finally we were served with a minumum of enthusiasm and given a room key for the third (top) floor, and pointed towards the lift. We dragged our bags there and found that the lift had an out of order sign on it. Rather than carry our heavy bags up three flights of stairs we asked if there was another lift. No, there was not, and neither did anyone offer to help us with our bags. Finally we reached the room (to be honest I can't remember what it looked like, I was so hot and bothered at this point) and headed straight for the shower. Unfortunately, whoever designed Classic Hotel's plumbing system didn't take into account the scorching local climate (temperatures approach 50 degrees Celcius in summer). The pipes for the top floor all went along the roof and were exposed to direct sun. Thus, the water that came out of the COLD tap was so hot we couldn't even touch it. Straight back down to reception to complain, noticing on the way a staff member emerging out of the apparently functioning lift, which still bore its out of order sign. We used the lift and removed the sign. At reception, our complaints were greeted with an attitude significantly colder than the temperature of the water. Nothing could be done, we couldn't change rooms, that's just how the water is. We could leave but we had to pay. Back to the room, and noticed that the out of order sign was back on the lift. Evidently the lift was reserved for staff use only through this rather devious system. We used it anyway and removed the sign again. Tested the water again, and it was still liable to give us burns. At this point I started ringing other hotels to find out if they had cold water in their taps. Despite my weird request I received a postive response from the hotel next door and arranged to go there. Rang Classic Hotel reception to inform them that we were leaving, and she said, oh, in that case we could change to a room on a lower floor. We said we wanted to test the cold water first. This we did and although it wasn't cold, it was bearable, so we changed (obviously with no help from staff). Breakfast the next day was pitiful. We had to wait 30 minutes to check-out, but at this point we didn't expect any better. My request to speak to the manager or get his/her contact details were refused. We left, glad to be out of there but appalled that such an establishment exists.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I am a Nicosia resident and on my birthday I decided to have a party at the hotel's Blue bar and spend the night at the hotel. The service and food at the Blue bar were excellent, as were the wines, which were well explained by the staff. After a recent referbishing the room seemed fine, clean and comfortable. After a good breakfast, the location of the hotel which is in the heart of Nicosia could not have been better for a stroll down the old part of town to end the weekend.",The Classic Hotel
40,"With a very helpful front desk, good breakfast, and 8minute walk into the centre of the old town, this hotel is value for money. Rooms are perfectly adequate, but a bit run down (mine was, anyway. Floor was all warped, and heating didn't work). Sauna was a joke- doesn't even work, and is super tiny. Gym is hard to find, but has a nice vie over the rooftops. All in all, a pretty okay place!",The Classic Hotel
40,"Location is the best advantage of this hotel. Right in the heart of Nicosia, easily accessible by taxis. Rooms are clean and comortable, even though a refurbishment would be needed. Breakfast is ok. Helpful staff, average prices.",The Classic Hotel
50,We stayed in the Classic for 2 weeks and could not fault this hotel. From the minute we arrived at Reception all the staff could not be any more helpful. Our room was clean and spacious and cleaned every day. The hotel is well situated within walking distance of the old town and only 2 minutes from the bus station should you want to venture further or have difficulty walking. We would like to say that when we visit Nicosia again we would definitley stay in the Classic again.,The Classic Hotel
40,"I have just spent 6 nights at the Classic as I have had a few business meetings to attend. I really like the location, the old town and the new town are both within walking distance. The room was very comfortable and there is free wifi available throughout the hotel. Breakfast is a buffet style but really has everything you need. I have spent a little time in the hotel's Blue Bar and it was very pleasant, the staff provided a good level of service. There is also free internet and printing near the reception.I think the hotel has recently been renovated and they have done a very nice job. I really want to mention the night porter, my flight did not get into Larnaca until 10.30pm so by the time I had driven to Nicosia it was midnight. I was really struggling to find the hotel, I was within 1 mile but just could not work out the way through. The guy told me to stop where I was and he would come and find me. He certainly did and I followed his car the 5 minute drive to the hotel, what great service.",The Classic Hotel
40,We moved to this hotel with another couple who stayed with us in the large room. Double beds were more than big enough. Service was pleasant and the 100x better than the place down the street (the Asti) in the bad slum. You can get a cab on the street quite easy. My only request is that they have more bottled water for guests available.,The Classic Hotel
40,"very good location, close to centergood taste and modern designrecently renovatedregular rooms a bit small but adequate spacegood breakfastprice is OK compared to other hotels in Nicosia and what they offermy keycard and my collegue's kept failingfridge was lockedthe rooms are arranged like in a labyrinthoverall opinion very positive (though not easy access for people with disabilities)",The Classic Hotel

50,"We stayed there for one night in a executive room and we payed 110 euro.Big and modern room, fantastic bathroom, jacuzzi and shower.They offered us a welcome drink with water melon, cheese and wine.Everything was clean and functioning.Breakfast can be improve.I stongly recommend it.Absolutely worth it.A tip: Don't stay more than one night in Nicosia because 24 hours are enough to visit it.",The Classic Hotel
30,It is a clean hotel while it was too expensive (98 euro for one double room).Of course sheets have few stains and there were no blankets and no tissue.The safe box was damaged. the internet was good and free.The breakfast was So-So although there were bugs around fruits!!!One of the staff was just OK and the others were helpful!The hotel is near the LIDRAS street that has many restaurants and is near the bus station and inter-city bus stop.There was toothbrush upon request!,The Classic Hotel
40,"In the few places in Cyprus where we found street signs, they were written either too small to be seen from an car or facing the wrong way. Finding our way to the hotel was more a matter of luck than skill, as attested to by other guests. The hotel is an interesting looking corner building with no street parking except at night, and only when you can find a space. The parking lot down the road about 1000 meters, behind a bus station, costs 5 Euros for the day (9-5). It is a tad far to load/unload the car.The very open, expansive lobby has cushioned benches, and photos, paintings, and sayings lining the walls. The night manager on our arrival was very helpful and gave us a choice of rooms and locations. He upgraded our room to a larger and more comfortable one without increasing our rate. All the managers answered questions, gave directions and suggestions for meals, stores, etc. The hotel has a computer room with Internet access and printers for guest use, a reading room with very few books or magazines. They have a bar and restaurant, where they serve 3 meals a day.Our large room had an entry way leading into the main room. Furnished with a firmly-cushioned couch, a narrow desk with flat screen TV above, 2 night stands, 2 twin beds attached at feet with firm mattresses, separate duvets with attached sheets, medium-size firm pillows, and bottom sheets that didn't fit, a small knee-high table, closet with 2 bottom drawers and hanging area with hangers, 2 shelves and a cupboard above with a fridge/minibar below. Adequate lighting was provided by 3 adjustable wall lights that from the night stands and the desk, a large lighted wall at the head of the bed, a light in the entry way, and the windows over the couch, which opened both vertically and horizontally, looking into a small courtyard below without any direct sun. There were 2 pairs of thick drapes that kept the morning light out. All electricity, except the fridge, was controlled by the room's entry key card. The spacious bathroom had a large (6 x 4 foot) walk-in shower with glass on one side and marble tile on the other, a shelf for one normal-sized shampoo bottle, and a hand-held head that could be set on the wall; temperature and water pressure were good. The square sink had counter space on one side and a narrow glass shelf over the toilet. The bathroom light switch was outside the door, and there was no fan. There was a mirror over the sink and an adjustable mirror on the side.The buffet breakfast is “included” in the room price, altho on the bill, it is listed as 7.5 Euros. There was a huge selection, no limit on serving size or number, that would cover most people's idea of breakfast: beans, cooked tomatoes, eggs, bacon, toast, sweets, fruits of all kinds, cereals, crepes, yoghurt, juices, and different coffee/tea offerings.Originally, we had booked a much smaller room that was not nearly as nice as what we got for 91euros. This is rather expensive, and having experienced the driving and parking issues in the city, we would probably stay outside the city at less expensive accommodations the next time. Overall tho, this hotel is very nice, has a terrific buffet breakfast and is within walking distance to the pedestrian zones and historical sites. It is an expensive hotel, however, so keep that in mind when budgeting.",The Classic Hotel
40,We checked out all of the hotels in the old town of Nicosia (South Cyprus) and this was by far the best one. Much better than the Centrum hotel and much cheaper than the Holiday Inn. Not as central as other hotels but the old town is so small you get to the main street in 5min walking.It is expensive for the rooms but it was ok for one night. It has a gym and a small sauna and has free wifi. It next to a Fire Station so you might be awaken by the sirens but all the rest is ok. Breakfast is good and staff are ok.,The Classic Hotel
40,"Small quiet modern boutique hotel, refurbished to a standard which puts the nearby Holiday Inn to shame., and at a fraction of the price.. Excellent spacious rooms, free internet and good buffet breakfast; all we needed.",The Classic Hotel
40,"It is a conveniently placed hotel. The reception area & the bar are its strong points. Wifi internet access available as well as seminar rooms. Nice overall, but I was not happy with the cleaning ladies. My window was very dirty and the towels have seen better days too. Overall good for business, I do recommend it.",The Classic Hotel
50,"Excellent 3-star hotel, reasonably priced for Nicosia. In walkng distance to shopping and the historic areas. My room was large and comfortable, including a spacious bathroom. Wi-fi was free and signal was strong. The public areas are very attractive. The breakfast buffet could have been a little better, but was okay. My only disappointment is that the room, though very contemporary, was under-decorated. I would have enjoyed some stuff to look at on the walls. The hotel has a massage service.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The hotel is newly renovated and very stylish. Our room was clean and a good size. The bathroom was compact and it's configuration a bit strange. But for two nights, the hotel served it's purpose as a base for exploring the old part of Nicosia. Our room faced the street which at times was jammed with traffic but the windows kept most of the noise out. Parking is a problem if you have a hire car as the hotel has no facility, so we had to use the public car park further down the road. The cost isn't too prohibitive but it's a hassle if you are staying for many days.",The Classic Hotel
50,"I am an occasional visitor to Cyprus and I was pleased to find that the Classic has not only been refurbished but has also lost none of its charm.Even though I was there on business I took advantage of their special offer and enjoyed the fare on offer in the Blue Bar.Nicely refurbished, central location - what more could I want.",The Classic Hotel
50,Absolutely beautiful renovation. The rooms are great and the location in the old town is fantastic. Give it a try.Clay Douglass,The Classic Hotel
30,"I came to ""CLASSIC HOTEL"" twice, and spent 2 and three nights. Recently renovated.The hotel is in the city walls of the old city of Nicosia actually. It is a contemporary hotel, contradicting to its ancient neighbourhood.It is about 12 minute walk from the shopping area and business centre where one can find restaurants and bars.I found this hotel quite expensive for the facilities offered. It has nothing luxurious in it! The room was not very spacious either, but it was clean and there were fresh clean towels changed daily. The bathroom was small. Of course there was a mini bar and a cable TV just to have my cold water in it and as usual it was just like any other mini bar with the usual snacks and chocolates or small bottles of wine, but everything was overpriced.I wonder how many people buy these things, or how old they are. I have this thought every time I see a mini bar in a room!There is a free internet access in the business centre for free.The manager of the hotel is running it himself along with the staff at the reception who are courteous and helpful.I had a comfortable stay, but I still think the hotel is very expensive for what it offers!I recommend this hotel for a short stay only!",The Classic Hotel
30,"First the hotel; it is very modern in appearance and the front of house renovation in October certainly looks good including the new winebar, the staff are very helpful and the rooms clean and comfortable if a little cramped. Note the firestation accross the road. Fortunately there were no emergencies during our stay as I doubt anyone would sleep through one!One note though the food was fairly average to poor. We ate in the bar as there is limited choice nearby in the city. My partners was good but I had to send mine back as it wasn't cooked through fully. The breakfast didn't do it either with the exception of the coffee and juice mentioned in other reviews. The cooked food was authentically cypriot but not to our taste in the morning so we had toast which was just warm bread, there is no toaster and we has to ask the staff to make it. The coffee machine made great coffee but I would not want to be there on a busy morning as it takes some time to produce a couple of double espressos!Now the real issue for the tourist - why visit Nicosia at all? I have a holiday property in Cyprus and fancied a night away during our latest stay. I had been to Nicosia about 8 years ago and seem to remember it with some fondness. Not this time I am afraid. Our first mistake was to take the shortcut 'back door' from the hotel on to Asinoes Str which was the heart of the Asian district. We went down this to the famous Lidras Street but to be honest hoards of men drinking on the street with broken glass everywhere it not my idea of tourist heaven at all, even if you like exploring the 'real parts' of a city.Having checked the best things to in Nicosia the list seemed to be limited to Museums and religious temples and there were only 5 or 6 of these, similarly there are few restaurant reviews for Nicosia which seems to match the number of restaurants in and around the old town.Now the passport - access to the occpied part is easy; a simple border crossing for which you need your passport. We forgot and so missed out on possibly the main reason to visit in the first place so if you do visit remember to take yours!Overall then a reasonable hotel if you have business in Nicosia or do want to do the tourist bit but I have been in better. On Nicosia we limited ourselves to the old town area because we only had one night. We cannot really comment on the more modern parts of the city as we didn't visit. We will be visiting again in the future though with our passport to visit the North.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The Classic is under renovation at the moment. So we didn't got the chance to visit the winebar... The rooms are splendid though, as is the breakfast. fresh orange juice, good espresso coffee.The rooms are very clean, modern, fresh and spacy. The beds are of high quality and it's relaxed sleeping. The firestation across the street gave us no trouble.I'm curious how it looks when bar and gym are finished!",The Classic Hotel
50,"This hotel, expanded many times, is a very well run hotel with all amenities included. The breakfast accomodated every taste with hours that worked well; their computer room had 4 up to date computers, flat screens with fairly fast internet and was well maintained (and free) and the staff was friendly and very helpful. There is free street parking. The only negative is that it is across from the fire station but they were very quiet and not disturbing while we were there. Our rooms were large and bright though we did see a few rooms that were pretty dark tucked into corners. This is not a fancy hotel but is far from basic and was extremely comfortable. The rooms included small fridges.",The Classic Hotel
40,"I visited this hotel last week. Its location is excellent located in the center of the city, close to all the main locations. Even though the rooms are somewhat small, they are very clean, the service is excellent and the breakfast has got a good variety of foods. The hotels wine bar, offers a variety of wines and great food.",The Classic Hotel
20,"I stayed there for one night during my business trip. The hotel's location is great and it looks very inviting when you enter the building but then the good things end there.Maybe we were just unlucky but our rooms were not ready when we arrived and we had to wait. The rooms are a bit dated and the cleaningness of the bathroom is 5/10.I had ants in my room and they were everywhere, in the bedroom, bathroom, walls, desk... I asked for another room but they were fully booked. I was given a spray for ants (so they were aware of the problem!). The next day I was moved to another room but there were ants there as well so I've checked out (luckily was not charged for the night) and went to Holiday Inn which is just a few blocks away.",The Classic Hotel
30,"The hotel is some meters away from Holiday Inn, inside the old city of Nicosia (free part). Old building which has been renovated. Rooms are big, in a very good condition and worth their money, compairig with other hotels nearby. Very nice wine bar at the lobby and great variety for breakfast. Nice choise if you want to visit the old and the new city of Nicosia. Safe and quiet neighborhood.",The Classic Hotel
40,"The hotel is very convinient situated in the middle of everything (museums, restaurants. etc) The rooms are OK, the breakfast very rich, but the best of all is the bar-restaurant which has an excellent atmosphere. The hotel has also enough rooms for conferences or seminars and an interesting waiting-room like a gallery.",The Classic Hotel
20,"Myself and three colleagues stayed at Classic as part of a business trip. The place looks good on the surface but dig a little deeper and things are n ot as good as you will have hoped for. Why? The rooms are basic, though when they were renovated they probarbly looked quite good. Some time has gone since this and they look a bit wormn and tired. Towels have a grey patina, mirrors are sufferign condensation damage and there is a general feeling that nthe place is a bit unloved. I had wanted internet access in my room but that was not possible wired or otherwise so it was down to the lobby for an extortionatelly priced connection (about 5 euro/1hr). Facitities open and close as they see fit. I had wanted a workout but the small gym offewred no running machine and the cross trainer was damaged (no notice on machine) so that it could have caused injury. No workout. Couple all this with my colleague having an ant infestation in her room (she moved to another room, still more ants, though my room was ant free) and that should be ample excuse, if needed, to move 50 meters down the street to the Holiday Inn.",The Classic Hotel
30,"We liked our stay at the hotel. It was easy enough to find by car, being close to the west entrance through the city wall (just south of the border with the north), just inside the old city. It is located exactly opposite the fire station. Close by is the Holiday Inn hotel, which also looks like a good hotel but is more expensive.The hotel is nothing fancy but we came to explore Nicosia. The location of the hotel is great, it is within walking distance of the main sites, the shopping and restaurant areas in the old city, as well as the main shopping and restaurant street (Makarios street) in the new city. Crossing through to the Northern side of the city was easy now, and we had a nice Turkish lunch there. For one of our dinners we went to the XEFOTO restaurant in the old city, which has by far the best Cyprus and Middle Eastern food (mezze!) anywhere, we stuffed ourselves.Anyway, back to the hotel. Breakfast is surprisingly nice. The bread and everything is really fresh.Our room was simple and with a small bathroom but decent. It does feel like you are trapped in a city hotel and you don't want to spend too much time in the room.The main area between the rooms is consistently hot like a sauna, even if it is chilly outside.Parking is a bit annoying. There are limited parking spaces in front of the hotel and permanent parking is only allowed on weekend and weekdays after 3:00 p.m. So I had to move the car from 9:00 am - 3:00 pm on weekdays to the nearby general paid parking area (in front of the Holiday Inn, about 3 Euro for 6 hours).",The Classic Hotel
40,I was there 3 days on business and 2 days with my wife. The hotel was made up of at least 3 old buildings joined together. Consequently the rooms were varied. Our bedroom was a little small but then we had an extra room for the wardrobe and another desk and chair. Beds were comfortable and the air conditioning unit worked well. The bathroom was just big enough. The breakfast was very good - with a machine for crushing oranges and a good selection of items. Prices for dinner were quite high (around 20 Euros for a main course) - however it is easy to find good food nearby at a good price. The wine bar was very pleasant and stocked a decent range. I missed a normal lounge - but then it is quite a small hotel. £70 a night seems reasonable for Nicosia.,The Classic Hotel
50,"On a business trip I want everything ""to hand"" and the Classic had everything I needed in this respect, either in-house or because of it's central location within walking distance. The hotel was clean and tidy, the staff helpful and the buffet breakfast offered far more than I wanted.Since I last stayed at the Classic in 2008 the discrete but rather boring ""Lobby Bar"", at the front of the hotel, has been transformed into the more interesting ""Blue WIne Bar & Lounge"". As is often the case the live music was on another night but the atmosphere and food offerings were a vast improvement and as it was a lot busier than I remember the refurbishment seems to be appreciated by others too. After a busy and tiring day it certainly saved me the need to venture into the city for dinner.",The Classic Hotel
10,"I wrote this review when I am still visiting Nicosia in Cyprus since I could not tolerate the total irresponsible and damaging attitude and arrangement by Classic Hotel.I booked three nights through a very reliable internet booking agency with booking confirmed by credit card.My wife and I arrived at the hotel at about 11:30 pm after 40 minutes' drive from Larnaka Airport where we landed. Already exhausted, we were shocked to be informed that we had no booking and the hotel was full (there are not many hotel in Nicosia). I showed the night shift person the confirmed document but he said that he did not have anything from the internet booking agency and could do nothing. He said that his hotel should not be wrong.As a foreign tourist with four pieces of luggages, we desperately looked for another hotel at 01:30 am. Luckily, Holiday Inn Hotel was not far and people there were more helpful and we managed to find a room but only at the ""walk-in ""price!I went back the next day and complained to the managress. She agreed to check out the reason and after two hours, she called back that it was the internet hotel booking company who was at fault by not notifying them my booking. However, since I immediately complained to the booking agency, they responded that they had already sent the fax to the hotel but the hotel did not read it! The hotel is indeed lying!What I want to warn you travellers is that this hotel is not trustworthy and care nothing about the guests. They made grave mistake and they still blame on others! The price and the hotel picture may be attractive but be careful.ChanHong Kong",The Classic Hotel

40,"This hotel has, I think, recently been refurbished, and is smart and modern inside. The service is a little inconsistent, and you have to pay for internet access, but apart from that, the hotel was pretty good.Breakfast is served in the smart restaurant, and has an excellent DIY orange juicer machine, which is worth using just for the fun of it!The hotel was full whilst I was staying, and I had what must be the worst room in the hotel (302), which should not have been a room at all: it was so narrow that there was no-where to open my suitcase apart from right in front of the door or on the bed, and the windows opened onto cement walls. However, I passed other rooms which were open for cleaning etc, and they looked spacious and airy. Avoid this room & you'll probably be OK!",The Classic Hotel
40,"Located just outside the UN buffer zone in Nicosia this hotel is everything you need. The staff are good, attentive and very helpful. Main shopping area just a few hundred metres away, ditto the museum. The romms are compact, very well appointed, and spotless. Superb hotel.",The Classic Hotel
20,"The Hotel and its rooms are nicely and modern designed. However all rooms facing the road and irrespective whether you stay in the first or the third floor are tremendously noisy even with fully closed windows. It is as if the cars and motorbikes drive directly through your room. We had arranged for 5 nights and I changed twice my room and so did 3 of my collegues. The rooms not facing the road are unfortunately limited in number and even there you can be unlucky and sleep next to something which makes every 2-7 minutes a loud enough noise to wake you up. (The hotel staff confirmed the noise but could not determine the origin of it).Thus if you can sleep despite a lot of very loud noise, this hotel is very nicely designed, has a good breakfeast and friendly staff and is also located very nicely in the old part of the town.If time allows, visit the 15 century Hammam in the old town which just has been renovated. The athmospere of this steam bath is wonderfully relaxing and a 90 minute hotstone massage is 40Euro and does wonders :).For the owner of the Hotel I strongly recommend to invest in good noise protecting windows, so that we can come again.",The Classic Hotel
