50,"As ever, simply marvelous and professional staff - from the Front Desk to Housekeeping, from the Executive Lounge to the Gym, from the Restaurant to the Bars, it really makes the difference, and makes the Landmark my favourite hotel in Cyprus. Very sorry my visit in April has been postponed, and hoping this virus crisis will soon be over. Thank you again for a wonderful stay.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed several times in the Landmark, the welcome and treatment went from very good to excellent. The whole team makes its possible to make your stay confortable and memorable. From the welcome to the room, every step is handled with care. An upgrade is generously offered when available, the rooms are spacious, the breakfast is diversified and enhanced each time. Lunch buffet is delicious and can be taken by the pool. its very central and easily accessible. Although the lobby needs some revamp, it has a story to tell, it is wide spacious and confortable. will come back anytime I am in Nicosia. Best regards to the whole team.

40,"Been a regular visitor for many years. Nicosia has been poor for 5-stars hotels, in fact there had always been just one monopolist. And it has always been the same. Which is good - for the staff, friendly and devoted. Which is bad- for the everlasting gap between the quality-benchmark of the 5-star facilities in Hilton Cyprus (now Landmark) and all the rest. In particular: - wifi is constantly switching off when moving within the hotel, probably the routers are not synchronised to provide for the constant wifi coverage. - The gym - old as the world. Even the 4-star-Hilton Park happened to renovate their gym to become much more attractive to me personally (if not the location) - Pardon me, but the manual toilet cleaners are absent in the bathrooms, which - together with the…",The Landmark Nicosia
10,"Summary of our experience:It’s been unacceptable service received to all passengers hosted at the hotel from British airways as been stranded since last night with plane diversion then flying back to larnaca and kept in aircraft over three hours then told to disembark not even to a local hotel but to travel all way to Nicosia an hour away despite its off season in larnaca to end up in the hotel checking in at 8:30 am.At the hotel No breakfast offered available on arrival despite noting all night shattered up passengers , so went straight to sleep after checking in after over 24 hours up as a doctor operating all day before flying yesterday.Then got a phone disturbance call from hotel reception at 11 am ie 2 hours later to be told if u want lunch it’s served between 1-3 pm expecting no sleep all night to run down waking me up to go to eat as if it’s school run not taking on consideration we were all physically exhausted and up all night.Then of course had to sleep and woke up and came downstairs at 4:30 pm asking for any meals as per BA email that hotel should provide lunch and dinner which the hotel is expected and should be accommodating our circumstances not just financial benefiting hotel who clearly just did a two hour open buffet expecting people to wake up after a couple of hours who haven’t slept all night.The hotel now despite paid for accommodating and hosting us by BA are refusing to offer me food to us saying dinner is next still in three hours at 7 pm leaving me since arrival the night before with no food provision despite in theory hotel paid to serve two meals which must be accommodating to the passengers exceptional circumstances not the other way round!!!That’s it!!This is unacceptable that five stars hotel paid to host all the passengers checking in at 8:30 am after stranded all night expecting passengers to get up to go down to eat their financially convenient arranged buffet rather than what’s convenient for the guests taking in consideration the time arriving and sleep requirement.So minimum is to allow alacarte flexible time or food upon request when we wake up not just be told sorry you missed it while they are paid for it and can’t expect to wake us up to eat then deny serving if slept expectedly.I end up being told by a porter called George that nothing can be done and if I need food I must pay extra charge which first isn’t acceptable for a porter to handle such a decision despite asking for manager then spoke to the reception front desk lady who kept again ongoing that they need to speak to the airline which I said is unacceptable as clearly hotel is paid to accommodate passengers checking in at 8:30 am after stranded all night and been paid to provide two meals which must allow Felix itt and accommodate the passengers not the hotel to just make money by providing two hours buffet expecting us to disturb sleep after over 24 hours up and stranded and not offering food flexibly either when awake and ala carte and none also breakfast offered on arrival.Clearly such cases hotel should provide the two meals BA paid for to accommodate the guests times and allowing time for expected sleep for the guests who have been up all night.Guess what it’s 6:16 pm almost 10 hours since checking in and still receptionist despite promising to get back never did and no manager available despite requested.Indeed as a professional doctor travelling worldwide and use of 5 star hotel services this is unacceptable like school or campus care for passengers!!!Indeed would never come here again and poorly review itDr Nataly AtallaExecutive club memberConsultant gynaecologist and senior lecturerLondon UkTel 07770580493",The Landmark Nicosia
50,The staff were exceptional all throughout my stay. I had the most efficient check in and check out. The breakfast is very good and hotel is very clean. Would highly recommend.

40,"Great hotel. what you would expect from a 5* business hotel in the middle of the business district. I stayed at an Executive Suite. The staff know exactly what they are doing and everything is smooth. My only negative comments is that the airconditioning system is very old (makes a lot of noise), while the bathrooms are a bit dated (old style phone-type shower with curtains)",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"I have been visiting the hotel every wee for the past 6 months. You get the same excellent service every time. The people are making the difference. The hotel itself needs some renovation. Nevertheless, it is of very good quality. There are quite a few amenities like the indoor and outdoor swimming pools, the executive lounge, the gym, sauna, jacuzzi, tennis courts not to mention the bars and the restaurant. I highly recommend it.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"I've been there for the second time to attend a conference. The rooms are spacious, the beds are of big sizes & comfortable. The food is excellent. The halls are well equipped for conferences & meetings.The annoying things about the hotel1) anytime the cleaners could get into your room & move things or throw empty bottles (even if you want to keep them!) away even after they entered for the first time to tidy up & clean the room, they could get there at noon or after noon, where you don't feel of privacy.The reception staff are fantastic2) the connected rooms which are separated by a door are noisy! I could hear the discussion of the neighbors , but actually they were very loud!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The hotel is really great , situated near by the center of the town.Rooms are clean and breakfast is great but the most important thing is its people. Everyone is so kind and willing to help , everyone is smiling and they all do their best to make your staying a great experience.

50,"I stayed at The LandMark Hotel Nicosia, for 7 weeks during September 2019 - November 2019, for business reasons. Firstly, I would like to thank all the Reception Team for their warm welcome and their high efforts to meet mine and my colleagues requests fromr room allocation to tips of where to go in Nicosia and the list goes on. I have to name two ladies which made our stay really comfortable by arranging immediately all of our needs , namely Mrs Maria Christodoulou and Mrs Maria Argyrou. Immediate to every request with so much positiveness. Even when one of us got sick, they have arranged special cooked soups and also provided communication details with doctors, and in general they showed how much they cared about us. I definately miss the names of the front desk, which they were all amasing. I definately have to mention other staff who were incredible to us, namely Mrs Helen Theocharous, Fotini Sanisa, Margarita Papavasiliou, Mr . Stelios Sofokleous and Mr Ilias Ilia. Nothing was a problem for them, and they were at all times ensuring that we had everything on time. Breakfast was more than great and the optimum for a good start of our day. Cant thank all of the team high enough. Fully recommended. Will be back soon, All best, Nikos & Maria Paleothodoros",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"My 2 night stay at The Landmark was quite decent. The rooms are clean and well sized, breakfast was a definite hit, location was close to my workplace and although, I did encounter a rude check-out, the overall service level was decent. The hotel does feel a little worn out, it was decorated tastefully. It was slightly far from the city center but still a 20 minute walk away. The pool and the breakfast area were nice. I also dined at their restaurant and was satisfied. Definitely, in a country which doesn't have many corporate chain hotels, it was a good business stay for its price.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We stayed at The Landmark, until May 2019 The Hilton Nicosia, overnight due to an early morning appointment. Apart from the name, we found no change from the excellence that we experienced during our previous stay. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom of good size. The staff were very friendly and the level of service was very good. A very nice buffet was served for dinner in the restaurant",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Landmark indeed, one of the most pleasant hotels to find out there!The staff was extremely pleasant, helpful and professional, in every sense, the front desk Assistant Manager, Maria, and her colleagues from the Lobby Reception have been most welcoming and helped me with answering various questions, provided speedy service and accommodated each of my requests.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Best place to stay in Nicosia. There is nothing to criticise really as all the boxes are ticked.

50,"This hotel lives up to it's old style hotel decor! The staff does an amazing job at making you feel welcome. The facilities are just as good as you would expect in such a nice place, especially the indoor swimming pool was a nice treat. The room was not recently refurbished but very clean and well maintained. Our room was spacious, fitting a double and two single beds and still not being cramped whatsoever.Breakfast buffet is really good and so is the lunch buffet and a la carte. It does not come cheap but offers quality and an outstanding service.My husband had a meeting for two days in the hotel and he had to impromptu go into the office on our check-out day. Upon request, the front desk allowed us a slightly later checkout, letting the kids and me enjoy the facilities without the rush and hassle of having to pack before noon. Thank you so much for those two extra hours that made all the difference between stress and a relaxed experience.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The hotel was just as expected. The bedroom was very comfortable. Yes - a little tired in places - but the service was 5 star. Had a problem with a slight leak in the bathroom, reported it to the wonderful George at reception. Had to move room and was compensated with a lovely suite. Could not have been more helpful. The main asset this hotel has are its staff. They are all polite and helpful. I asked for a mirror for the bedroom, (there is a large wall mirror and magnifying mirror in the bathroom but I prefer one in the bedroom area) Maria, the executive housekeeper was on to it straight away, a delightful lady. The dining room staff are attentive and quietly efficient. We stayed for 7nights, and loved it. The outdoor pool area was very inviting and a pleasant place to sit and relax. Would definitely return",The Landmark Nicosia
50,The Landmark is the former Hilton. While the name has changed everything else is exactly the same. You will not see any difference to the excellent service that has been key for this hotel for many years.,The Landmark Nicosia

40,"I visit the hotel for second time, the accommodation was perfect. Very polite people, rooms with perfect view. The restaurant has quick service but the prices were too high, for example chicken kebab cost close to 30 euros. Last but not least a delicious breakfast!!!hope to visit it again soon.....",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on business. Had an exec room which gave you access to an extra lounge for complimentary basic drinks and food.Room was of a good size, bed was comfortable with good linen. Old TV system with very basic tV channels. Good size bathroom with proper bath.Only had breakfast which was a good spread.Hotel has both an indoor and outdoor pool. Indoor pool is part of a gym open to locals so only certain times you can swim without there being swimming lessons on. Outdoor pool is huge and a great temp for proper swimming. Lots of loungers around so nice and relaxing.We got a cab to town but there is a couple of places to eat and drink around the hotel. Theee is also a kiosk in the hotel for drinks and snacks to avoid the expensive hotel prices.Main thing about this hotel was the staff - everyone was so friendly and helpful with lovely little touches like the little cake the restaurant gave us on leaving to the cards fromHousekeeping",The Landmark Nicosia

This Hotel is the best in Town in terms of Service and generosity...Also the Manager is tremendously the best ever..Thanks Landmark Team..,The Landmark Nicosia
10,Incredibly expensive for a very very poor breakfast. 22 euros which is ridiculous. Kebab 29 euros. Just a rip off for a very old and dated sub standard hotel. Don't waste your money as it has nothing going for it. Needs considerable up dating,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"There’s no doubt about it the Landmark hotel (the old Hilton) is a first rate hotel. We’ve been coming here for years and its standards have always been very high. Centrally located (about 10 minute walk to old Nicosia) the hotel offers comfortable rooms, great service and a great breakfast. We were upgraded to a huge room that overlooked the pool. The pool itself is sublime, it’s clean with good loungers and surrounded by date palms and colourful shrubs. The staff at the Landmark are simply wonderful, helpful, friendly and accommodating. Some have been there for 30 years which must say something! A big thank you to Maria Londou Argyrou, reception office, Maria housekeeping and Nicos and Eleni at breakfast! It was also great to see Andreas, one of the porters, who has been there since the 80’s. Altogether a wonderful, enjoyable stay. We will be back. It’s the only hotel in town!",The Landmark Nicosia

Location is quite central and for a few nights it’s quite ok.

50,Staid for only one night due to a delayed flight but the staff were very nice and smiling even though they had 200 odd people arriving very late at night. We were told we may get some cold snacks but the staff put a spread for us which was really nice having just travelled for 2 hours in a bus.The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. A true 5* hotel and I would gladly return if ever again in Cyprus.Thank you for the very warm welcome that made a horrible day a bit nicer.,The Landmark Nicosia

The staff are all the ex Hilton staff and are excellent. Breakfast is very good and most of the year you can sit outside near the pool.Parking is excellentLocation for business is superbIt's just a tired hotel that needs investment... But I will keep coming back",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"First the good. The service is absolutely first class. Our room was lovely and the pool area in the middle of a city is first rate (but see below)The bad. The food is just not good enough. The lunch buffet has quantity but not enough quality. Ditto for the pool food.The ugly. This is too expensive compared to everything around it. Oh and as for the consistent dirge of the incessant dull pop music, the less said.",The Landmark Nicosia

And similar distance to the leventis galleryBreakfast buffet is excellent and the staff are tremendous. The buffet has every thing and some unique Cypriot flavours. Loved the touch of the chef bringing something special from the kitchen. ExcellentThese are some aspects of the hotel that are a little tired. Lounge furniture, guest rooms it does not take from the wonderful, facilities, Service and welcome",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I am going to write my review over four parts due to the word limit.This is a very genuine review, and everything said here comes from the bottom of our hearts not only as returning guests, but just from two people who appreciate having their stay made very special once again.Every single year we, my husband and I, spend our holidays in this wonderful hotel, however, we were concerned at first when The Landmark has taken over the Hilton post booking this holiday. Will the staff be the same? Will the service be as magnificent as it always has been? Will we be treated with such great attention to detail as we always have? My worries were very quickly put aside on the day of our arrival.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Stayed one night due to a delayed flight with partner. Hotel itself is grand and clean, very nicely kept, though it seems a bit dated. Unfortunately, the hotel seems really unprepared for guests. WiFi was a bit slow all over the hotel. Lunch, dinner, and all snacks/drinks were way too overpriced. For example a beer was 7euro when they cost about 1,50 euro in the shop. 1L bottle of water was 8 euros. Rooms were not soundproof, heard our neighbours all night. Massive red stain on the bed sheets. Went down to use the pool and there was no chairs left. Asked the staff if they had any extra chairs for the pool area and was told “what do you want us to do? There’s no chairs left, I can’t do anything for you”. Food was subpar and breakfast was terrible. Bread was stale, eggs were watery and rubbery.Definitely a shame, overpriced and overrated.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,5-star hotel and this is the food that they give you. The meat was so dry that you could start a fire with it by just rubbing to chunks against each other.We just stayed one nice because or flight was delayed. So maybe they didn’t have time to prepare. But then it’s better to say that we don’t have food than to feed people this? Can the hotel stand behind this and think that this is ok food then fine but I hope they don’t.The rooms are great and the same with the lobby. Fitness area is good with an inside pool.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,Very quick check in as there was 2 bus loads of people from a cancelled flight.Comfy beds. Great breakfastWould love to stay here on a holiday break again as there seems to be everything you need here,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"One of my favourite hotels in the world.The Landmark most of all has fantastic staff, restaurant, front desk, housekeeping, gym, service provision is always professional, friendly, super-effective, customer focussed and always warming.Restaurant food is really good, as also is the executive lounge providing snacks.Always very grateful to the immense efforts of Maria Christodoulou welcoming us every time, lovely rooms, marvellous atmosphere, and by a large measure the best hotel in Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,Was staying at a nearby hotel on business and visited the Hilton to sue their swimming pool for just €15. Did so twice and the experience was nice during very hot temperatures in Nicosia. The food was not great though I ordered a Parma ham pizza and what so was given (for €20!) was a pizza brought in from a shop with some Parma ham and rocket on top. Hopefully the culinary standards will Improve now it has been rebranded to Landmark hotel,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"My husband and I took an impromptu visit to Nicosia whilst on a three week holiday in Cyprus. We had not booked a hotel but on arriving in Nicosia we came across the Hilton Cyprus and pulled in. We were met at reception by courteous and very helpful staff, the surroundings of the hotel were excellent, clean and easy to navigate. We were given a lovely room and use of the business lounge as my Husband is a Hilton points member. The management, reception staff, lounge and restaurant staff, in fact all staff, could not do enough for us. We felt so welcomed and important. They went over and above their duty talking to everyone, checking everything was alright without being intrusive on your space. They made each guest feel important. They helped with directions to places we wanted to visit. When mentioning I enjoyed the historical buildings etc Maria, head of housekeeping actually went to her office and got me a book about Cyprus landmarks. Food and cleanliness were great and we would certainly have no hesitation to book into this hotel again, especially because of the dedication of all of the staff from management to cleaners. We cannot praise them enough. We hope to visit next year in fact. Six star luxury at five star prices. Best Hilton we have stayed at.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Very nice hotel. Staff is very very helpful and service is fast efficient and polite. Venue is nice, nice pull and lobby with Piano at some afternoons. Breakfast is great, dinner less...Room was nice and spacious with all the required amenities , decor is dated and need refresh.Overall very good experience, recommend.Enjoy",The Landmark Nicosia

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was comfortable and of a good size, as was also the bathroom. The restaurant is pleasant, with inside or outside seating, and the food was good. We ordered breakfast in the room and this was delivered promptly and as ordered. Altogether a very nice experience. It is understood that this hotel will cease to be part of the Hilton group at the end of this month (May 2019) and will thereafter be known be known, I believe, as The Landmark. Apparently the staff are all to remain with the hotel and it therefore seems highly probable that this will reman an excellent place to stay.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Great stay when travelling for business. Home away from home. Makes travelling for business a painless experience. Great friendly staff in all areas and conference facility staff were excellent in assisting us with our event.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Short but nice 2 day stay. Lovely but small rooms with nice balconies. Lovely public areas and super outdoor breakfast area.Gorgeous pool for lane swimming BUT doesn’t open until 10AM! This fits with local culture of course but the thought of an early swim was one reason for our booking.Also, surprised at lack of concierge outside hotel door especially for 5*.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Hilton Cyprus, Nicosia is set in a deceptive area. Depending on which road you arrive from the cover somewhat puts you off the book. However, this first impression is wrong.The hotel is grand and spacious. We were swiftly checked in by a kind receptionist, and then were lead by the concierge to our hotel room.We had access to the executive lounge which was lovely, well maintained and offered that little extra something to our stay.Breakfast every morning was delicious and the staff were friendly, helpful and remembered you from the day before and asked about your trip. The selection offered was brilliant too.The outdoor pool and sun loungers were lovely. You can spend the day relaxing in the sun, reading in the shade or having a bite to eat at your bed or at the bar.The indoor pool is a little small but great for an evening swim if you want to cool off and there is a jacuzzi, sauna and steam room too. And large gym areas if you feel like working out.I had an incredible stay and it was mostly down to the friendly, attentive staff members working here.Would recommend for business or a holiday. The staff will blow you away. They certainly exceed standard hospitality levels.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"It excellent for business and the only five star hotel in Nicosia. The rooms are renovated and beds are now more comfortable. Maria Argyrou, the manager of the front desk is always available to attend to any needs I have been staying at this hotel for over a decade and hope continue to do so.Staff is bending over backwards to assist. Marios, George, Christina, Andreas, Georgia, ALexia, Yiannis, Ioanna and the rest, know what they are doing. The hotel's shops certainly worth visiting especially the jewel shops. Excellent hair dressing salon with elemis products . Great pool. Spa is outsourced and facilities need drastic improvement. Opt for the rooms that face the swimming pool. Food is great, try the signature club sandwich. I always like to sit at the lobby and the comfortable sofas.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This was my fourth stay in Hilton Cyprus, and I have to say that it is getting even better every time I'm there, the room is super clean, the staff is very friendly, a lot of options if you need to spend some time working or having a quick business meeting, a very good breakfast with a very decent variety.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"good hotel for business, good service. Could do with longer opening hours of pool as closing at 18.00 is not practical for business people! Rooms clean but need refreshing!Breakfast and restaurant very good!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This hotel caters to business travelers and is located about a 10 minute ride from the old city. The property was very clean. Housekeeping was good. There's a lovely outdoor pool. All the staff were friendly and went out of their way for us. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. The chef came around to the tables with fresh baked olive bread which was delicious. The executive lounge had cocktail hour from 5-7pm offering alcohol drinks, soft drinks, and light snacks. The only negative thing I can say about this hotel is that it's in serious need of an upgrade. The rooms look like they were designed in the 1970's. There are hardly any plugs in the rooms and no USB ports at all. The furniture and decor in the room as well as in the lounge and restaurant needs to be updated. It's so uncomfortable that you really don't want to sit and have a drink or a meal. Other than this, the hotel was great!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This is a large, modern hotel situated on a main road into Nicosia. There is a reasonable amount of free parking available. The hotel has a large pool and sunbathing area overlooked by the Pergola Grill and bar. Unfortunately the pool was closed due to the unseasonably cold weather.Room 333 is a large, well equipped room with tea/ coffee making facilities, an in-room safe, an iron and ironing board and plenty of hangers and storage space. The suitcase stand is big enough for 2 cases. There is a large table suitable for working and the king sized bed was very comfortable, with good bedside lights. The fridge was mostly filled with overpriced items from the minibar.The shower is an in-bath one although effective, with an extending line for drying clothes. There is a good magnifying mirror beside the hand washing basin.There is a balcony with 2 seats and a small table which gets the sun during the afternoon, although it only overlooks the car park and hotel entrance.Breakfast was a buffet which costs costs €19pp. It offers good value for money because there was a good selection of juices, cereals including Burcher muesli and porridge, breads, cold meats and cheeses as well as salad items. There was also a good range of hot items and staff would prepare eggs, etc to order. The coffee was excellent and there was a good variety of teas available. On our second morning, the staff member greeting us remembered our name! Each morning we were offered a croissant or Danish to take with us.When we checked out, the lady on reception gave us some lovely wee gifts to thank us for staying with them.On several occasions we ate in the lobby area which offered good food at reasonable prices.",The Landmark Nicosia

The hotel provides a complete service that meets all possible needs and offers excellent facilities. Highly recommended.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"No doubt that this is your only choice if you need to stay for business in Nicosia. The hotel is kind of ""Old Fashioned"" and needs further updating throughout.The service is impeccable and highly attentive, the rooms are comfortable but again very old fashioned and needs to be updated to the current level of business travellers expectations.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights with children aged 6 and 8. The majority of guests appeared to be on business or attending functions in the city and there were few families.Pros:-excellent family room, very spacious with two additional single beds for the children- very good buffet dinner & breakfast-impressive lobby area- great staff who went out of their way to take care of the children (especially Helen)Cons:- it's quite a long walk into the city centre (30 minutes+). Traffic and parking is difficult - recommend using a taxi.- very limited range of English TV stations- the outdoor pool was closed as staff said it was too cold - this was a shame as we had chosen the hotel specifically because of its pool facilities- we had to share the indoor pool with 20+ local children for several hours each afternoon/early evening, most of whom were having swimming lessons. We noticed that other hotel guests were struggling to swim lengths. Once the children had left, an exercise class started, which was even noisier!-there are insufficient changing facilities and this meant that fathers were in the changing rooms used by girls and their mothers, which was unexpected and the pool manager did not consider that this was an issue- the air-conditioning heated rather than cooled the room, which meant that we had to sleep with the windows wide open - lots of traffic noise",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Hilton in Nicosia was a very relaxing hotel and easy to find. The staff was very helpful considering it was a Friday of a three day holiday weekend.(Green Monday)While my sister liked the bed, I found it to be a little too hard especially since I am a side sleeper.The breakfast buffet was also very good with a variety tha would please most. Fresh orange juice, great halva, tasty yogurt, good cappuccino, and a chef who likes giving travel recommendations to the guests.Bathrooms were nice with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries.",The Landmark Nicosia

My wife and I always look after to stay in Hilton hotels because they treat us so well that we become fan of them!Although the hotel is old, it is very clean, comfortable, with authentic Cypriot food: I tasted it at breakfast, lunch (the conference arranged lunch at the hotel) and dinner.One of the greatest thing I like in Hilton Cyprus (but I've seen it in Hilton at Milan and New York) is how well I was treated by their staff. They make you feel comfortable every time. At their restaurant entrance, the attendant there recognized me after the second time I was taking my meal there.So, if you have opportunity to be at Cyprus, try to stay in Hilton Cyprus: it worth every penny you spend there.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We travelled to the Hilton Nicosia for two friends birthdays and didn't know what to expect. As soon as we checked in Maria and her amazing team made us feel exceptionally welcome and did everything they could to make this a very special trip. Maria surprised us all with the most amazing birthday cake on our friends birthday and continued to go the extra mile throughout our stay. This is a classic Hilton with a great spa, pool and gym along with a full executive lounge with free booze and food between 5 and 7. It's only a 25 minute walk from the historic city centre and on a useful bus route of you don't want to walk. I sincerely hope that nothing much changes if the hotel becomes something other than a Hilton in future as everything about this establishment is perfect. Thank you again for an amazing trip.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,I write this review during my fourth stay at this hotel for this year. First of all It is a Hilton and is a 5 star hotel that means the faicilities and luxury is guaranteed. But the real 6 stars is the staff extremely helpful and always serve you with a smile. They make you feel like Home...... :),The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This was my third visit to this hotel and as always the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. On my arrival, I was greeted by Maria, the charming front desk manager who remembered me from a previous visit. I was upgraded to a nice suite overlooking the pool. The suite was spacious, quiet, clean and just right for my needs. The breakfast buffet was and the service exceptional. I will certainly come her again in my next visit to Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Well, as mentioned in some other reviews, I had to visit Cyprus in February 2019 for business. My colleague booked the Hilton in Lefkosia (as this was our only option at the time; all hotels were fully booked...). Let me start with the good part: the service by all staff was excellent, and I mean excellent! The food was good and fresh. The gym was ok too, although they could do with an equipment upgrade. Having said that, now the not so good part: this hotel is in dire need of TLC and upgrade. The free internet is slow (and there is always a catch in these sort of hotels that drives me nuts: the fast option is never for free!). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the service level displayed by the staff.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I have been staying in Hilton on a frequent basis over the past months. Absolutely love the people in the hotel. Truly customer-focused the staff is always there to help and make you feel like home. Thank you, Maria, Alexia, Andreas and Stelios for the warm welcomes and the pleasant stays during each one of my stays.Rooms are spacious, bright and clean. Food at the hotel could have been better. Executive Lounge is also ok, it would be nice if the snacks and drinks hours could be extended to 8 pm, in order to better accommodate Business travelers.",The Landmark Nicosia

Very large suite, but no plugs in the bathroom and no shower, bathtub only. Gym seem to be a public gym, not the newest machines. Executive lounge excellent, nice food and drinks. Breakfast plentiful and good. Prefer rooms on the upper floors as view is good.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed in Hilton Cyprus for 5 nights and it was a great experience at all stages.The most amazing part is the ultimate ""guest focused"" service and particularly in the main restaurant during the breakfast. Regardless the position all staff members are focused to serve the guests, interact, replenish the sections and also offer ""daily specials"". The breakfast is excellent, rich and varied. The hostesses Helen and Fotini are remarkable professionals.The Executive Housekeeper goes around the tables and proactively asks if the guest are happy with their rooms.The only remark is on the decoration and the amenities in the room. There is no electrical plug in the bathroom, the shower mechanism is not very functional and there is no kettle in the room.Equally the concierge and FO services are very welcoming, helpful and professional.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I truly enjoy staying in Hilton as feel so welcomed and accommodation and service is top class. Alexia at the reception, Mrs Maria assistant front manager, Fotini at the breakfast and actually every member of the team strive to deliver the best customer experience and pay attention to small details.

50,"This is an older property and does not look like much from outside, but once you step inside...WOW! Very nicely appointed lobby and lounge and restaurants and conference facilities are fantastic. The service was exceptional. Everyone from the front desk staff to the hostesses in the restaurant and the housekeeping staff were friendly and attentive. The buffet breakfast was very good (although caters mainly to a European palate) and was very well staffed by attendants. The executive lounge is open all day and serves delicious complimentary canapes and alcoholic beverages for two hours in the evening. My room was on the poolside and was very quiet. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Not much around the hotel. About 30min walk to the old town center. Everything in the room looks like it is from the 1980s. But great workspace and Internet was fast. Wasn't impressed with the service at the reception. Had two teas in the lobby bar and paid 13 Euros for that! Room on the other hand had water kettle with good tea selection for free. Room facing the parking lot was quite noisy sometimes. Also, be careful when closing the balcony door. My finger got stuck between the frame and the door knob and I almost needed medical attention because of it. Shower was great but very difficult to control the temperature. So overall, it was fine but definitely not a great experience.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"Originally booked a standard guest room for 3 nights.Later on prolonged my stay for another 4 nights.We arrived quite late, but checking in was not a problem.A lovely gentleman welcomed us and everything was already prepared and went smoothly.Due to my Gold member status we were upgraded to a junior suite. Thank you!The room was lovely and spacious and had a balcony.On the table there was a welcoming card and a plate of fruits and lukum.Breakfast is also great! Room was also cleaned everyday. good job from the HSK team (even the cleaning lady was lovely, I met her a couple of times in the hall and had a chat.)Every morning there was a lovely young lady with dark brown hair welcoming us. I really wish I remembered her name, cause she really was the highlight of this hotel. There were a couple of days I was alone and she always made sure to have a chat with me and that everything is okay. Loved the iced lattes there! A couple of mornings there was a lady making pancakes or waffles and you could choose your prefered toppings.(there was literally atleast 20 options to choose from). The pool area was also nice. I unintendidly caused a scene there with the locals who dont stay in the hotel but use the pool area during the day. It was solved by the hotel staff calming the old lady down and letting her know that I did nothing wrong. Then she left angry. It was ofcourse not the hotels fault but hold in mind that something like this can happen again, since the locals spend there a lot of time and are rather badtempered and bored. Specially the older ladies. I heard from a local gentelman that this had not been the first time that this particular lady had caused problems. But big thanks to the hotel staff to help me out and solve the issue fast.Hotel also has a gym, which is the best hotel gym that I've ever seen. Existence of the gym for me is really important since I do sports ona professional level and need to keep myself in shape at all times. It had everything you could wish for, from cardio machines to a fully equipped lifting area.The city centre(old town) is not far, but we chose to have a taxi every time. It didn't cost too much. And the taxi station was just in front of the hotel.Thank you for this nice stay. When visiting cyprus I will def. stay there again.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"An island floating aw a green leave in the middle of Eastern Mediterranean sea .Mother country of philosophers , sculptors and famous personalities of culture now divided in two pieces by a red line , The one , which is still Cypriot area , is occupied by an enormous enemy army. Although Nicosia is divided in two parts remain the only capital in the world to have such an occupation. Any way , it is a must to visit it and taste the Greek food, swim in warm and blue sea , see the enormous variety of shrubs and herbs , visit the archaeological places with a lot of remains of ancient Greek civilization. Don`t forget it and make your program for the next spring.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"LocationThe property has a much better location compared to the Hilton Park Nicosia if you are mainly in the area for tourism reasons. It is about a 15-20 min walk to Ledra street. By car it is about 5 mins with average traffic and parking in the centre of Nicosia is relatively cheap with parking fees ranging from 2.50 -4 Euros. Around the hotel there are a couple of small shops (mainly convenience type) and small eateries.Check InI arrived just late morning at the hotel and there was no one before me so I was helped immediately. I was checked in by Alexia, a friendly and informative front desk associate. I was given a run down of my elite benefits. I was off to my room within minutes of arriving at the hotel.RoomAs an elite member, I was upgraded to a Junior suite. The property is what I would categorized as a grand old dame in Nicosia. It is an old world hotel which is situation in a large complex with a number of shops within the building. This is reflected in the rooms too. It was old world furnishing but yet still grand in it's own way. Yes, the furnishing is dated, but it is well kept and functional.The size of the room was large even without physical separation, the room was well separated, with the sleeping area, working desk area and the sitting/dining area.The bed was very comfortable and I had a good night sleep every night. Temperature control was good and the internet quality was good.The bathroom was also large with a walk-in shower and bathtub. The only small improvement would be the walk-in shower which is slightly on the smaller side ( it is narrow but long). Other than that, the water and temperature control was very good. Toiletries were the usual ones that you find at Hilton's these days.Executive LoungeThe lounge was situated on the highest floor of the hotel. The space was quite large and access is by key card entry only. It is normally not manned except during the hors d'oeuvres hours where there's an attendant who was very friendly and efficient.During the day, soft drinks and coffee/tea with small bites and fruits are available.The evening hors d'oeuvres is very good, and you can basically make dinner out of it. Very good selection and quality. There is a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Sadly, the hotel does not serve local Cypriotic wines but they had wines from Chile.BreakfastBreakfast is served in the main restaurant of the property. The selection of items were very good - as expected from such a hotel. They did have a couple of Cypriotic items. There is also a pancake station and fresh juice station. Other than that, you can order eggs cooked to your choice. Quality was good and food was replenish promptly. Staff were friendly and efficient.ServiceGreat service from all different levels at the hotels. Very helpful and friendly staff.OverallAll in all, another great Hilton. The hotel elite recognition was very good, besides the upgrade, I was brought a welcome amenity later in the afternoon.This property is large with different wings. The only small thing which seems out is that the area around the hotel seems to be not the most happening area of Nicosia with the building/ground across the street from the hotel broken down and not rebuild, and the back part of the hotel complex seems to be a no man's land.Other than this, another top Hilton in my books which other Hiltons in the world should follow as an example from both service level and appreciation of their elite members.",The Landmark Nicosia

Very professional service all in all. Room was bit small for the high price. Also, sound-proofing was not that good and noise from main road was audible (but I slept well). Breakfast up to five star levels, not huge selection but good range of foods for different tastes. Hotel complex had a mini-shopping complex of jewel, cigar, etc. shops. Big pool looked very inviting. Hotel is located about 20min walking distance from old city, but I guess most people here are chauffer driven.

It seems to be a focal point and a good place for meetings.The staff were extremely helpful and really bent over backwards to help out. The check in was extremely smooth and the cleaning staff were extremely warm and welcoming.The room itself (executive twin) was very comfortable. There was a good amount of space and had plenty of storage. I slept very well on the bed and the desk meant that I was able to catch up with work. The bathroom was very clean. I had no problems with the shower or bath. There were some great views of Cyprus from the balcony. The standard Wi-fi was fast and meant I could stream with no issues at all.Fontana Restaurant was somewhere I spent a lot of my time. The choice at breakfast was amazing and delicious. The waiting staff were extremely friendly. The buffet for €23 was excellent value for money in the evening.I spent a quite a bit of time in the lobby. The meeting space was comfortable with plenty of plug sockets. The drinks and food available were a little pricey but was expected.I also used the gym facilities. There was a wide range of equipment. Though, I didn’t use the indoor pool, my colleague did and was very impressed.Parking was very easy. Reception provided me with a card for access in and out of the main car park. If you are driving, you can have an hour for free in the car park outside the lobby.The location of the the hotel is just outside the town centre.

One balcony overlooked the garden and the other one the city.The BedroomThe bedroom gave a comforting feel to space and the king-size bed was way too comfortable.Complimentary treat, a small bottle of wine, fruit and Cypriot delicacies.BathroomThe bathroom, spacious and well lit, towels of superb texture, and quality toiletries.Swimming Pools and SpaThe outdoor pool and Jacuzzi add to the peaceful scene.The indoor Pool is for guests only and there is a Sauna, a Jacuzzi and a Fitness Center.During my stay, I had the Anti-aging Facial which was executed perfectly by my therapist Elena. I bet, you will find the menu of beauty and spa treatments interesting.Visiting the Hilton Cyprus Hair SaloonI stepped into Zac Hair Designers Beauty Saloon located opposite the lifts of the executive wing. The people behind are qualified professionals and will do their best to deliver a complete hair and beauty experience from a hair-cut, styling to waxing and more.Fast and beautiful, Petro showed that he is a professional. I had a trim without a coiffure hairdo this time and it was more than I could expect. Whether you need a trim, a colour refresh or a dramatic makeover, a visit here will leave you feeling marvellous!RestaurantsFontana –All day Restaurant – Mediterranean cuisineMy suite had access to two different breakfast locations, -the Executive Lounge and the Fontana Restaurant. I had mine at the classy and chic Fontana, where guests have the choice of a wide selection of hot & cold dishes as well as healthy options.The Executive LoungeResidents of the executive rooms and suites can benefit from this specially designed area where they can enjoy complimentary breakfast, tea, coffee, cakes, canapés, but also alcoholic drinks & cocktails and a selection of seasonal fruits. Newspapers and Internet access are also available.Pergola Grill & BarThe food is so good that I’d recommend having dinner at least one night during your stay. As from this year, it is open to non-residents as well and happened to be there on the “Friday Night Swimming”. Hurry, before summer is over!On this particular night, locals are welcome to participate and chill out around the pool till quite late. Check their media pages for more info.Fine dining - A la carteThe night I was here with a friend we started off with three highly recommended appetizers. The exquisite Salmon Tartar was immensely refreshing, the Quinoa and Kale Salad with Grilled Shrimps and the Goat Cheese salad. All three nicely presented and yummy!Main courseI had the Grilled Jumbo Prawns sided by a baked potato and vegetables. Cooked to perfection, fresh and mouthwatering!My friend opted for the Black Cod with Quinoa which had a buttery flavour and a delicate silky texture!DessertOur dessert choice was the Caramelized Phyllo with Strawberries and the warm Galactoboureko sided with an ice cream ball. Both nicely presented and toothsome!Beverage - ServiceWe accompanied our meal with a matching wine!The service is classy and efficient making you realize that you're somewhere special. I can’t recall one bite that wasn’t lovely.All in all the Hilton Cyprus Hotel is a great all-rounder hotel ideal for business trips, a relaxing getaway, corporate tours, events and conference meetings. The warmth, friendliness and professionalism of every team member are second to none. Highly recommended!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,I reviewed the Hilton Cyprus right here in early June 2018 but now found my review is gone! So I want to review it again!The Hilton Cyprus is a fantastic hotel. I was treated so well by all the staff and can highly recommend the hotel. Food is awesome!Please don't remove my review again - whoever did it!,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We stayed for 1 week, after 1 week at the Hilton park nearby. On first impressions I wasn’t happy as the Hotel needs updating in many ways, broken sun beds are not what you expect for 5*. Pool side grills were dirty and new towels are needed. Also pool bar staff are not attentive enough, they do bring drinks to you after you go to the bar and order however I feel the staff should ask guests regularly if they can get them anything as this is the kind of simple 5* treatment guests should receive. Also after ordering cocktails at the pool side, they tasted awful and not made how they should be. Upon telling the bar lady she was very angry and told my husband to leave with a gesturing hand movement and snapped she would bring out. They arrived again and still nothing like they should be and she told us they were just too strong for us (but it was the incorrect alcoholic and ingredients used), however we just drank them anyway to avoid anymore fuss.The executive lounge is a great way to unwind after a day by the pool, with friendly more than helpful staff and a good selection of snacks and drinks.Reception staff and concierge are brilliant they can’t do enough and I was even given homemade gifts that George’s wife had made, that really was the most personal touch and so thoughtful.The chefs in the morning are very helpful and nothing is too much trouble. There is a great selection of food on offer.We had a really lovely stay and we would visit again.If a few things were tweaked and updated a little this really would be a fantastic hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,We had a late checkout at 2pm but we were denied access to the lounge.I am a member. And we were not told about this. The pool is nice as well as the rooms but the wifi isn’t good. The hotel is good for like 1-2 nights in my opinion,The Landmark Nicosia
30,We arrived at the hotel at 5am after a delayed flight. Fortunately we were given our room right away because we were so exhausted. Unfortunately the Aircon in the room was not working and we were extremely hot. The rooms at the hotel are a bit dated but the staff were great. They were friendly and hospitable.,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Yes we were only put up here by TUI after night flight cancelled but as a Hilton fan we were less than impressed.The room allocated to us was ‘a nice room’ when the reception lady gave us the key because we had a pool view. Yes it was a quiet position.That said, the room and bathroom were both a 70s throwback with dark decor and old fashioned upholstery (nothing like the website showed when we had a look on the bus transfer).Then to find out we would need to pay for wi-fi in the room and most tv services too, we were less than impressed.Staff encountered were pleasant enough but the room (did I mention the cranky air con and musty smell?!) really disappointed us. Breakfast was shabby to say the least but we understood we weren’t paying guests and they had to suddenly cater for 200 extra guests but why couldn’t we eat in the restaurant and access the normal breakfast offerings?!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We stay in a lot of hotels, but I’ve rarely experienced such good customer service. From reception to concierge with a special mention for breakfast and executive lounge staff, every member of staff was thoughtful and caring. They smiled and always did their very best to help. The executive lounge itself is also worth the extras as it’s very comfortable and the evening canapés are delicious. My partner and I were impressed and would love to go back! Special thanks to Fontini Sanida who started each of our day with a smile, she’s a star!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The hotel itself could us a bit of an upgrade. BUT, their staff is amazing! Everyone we‘ve encountered at the reception desk was extremely friendly. Mr. Panagiotis (sorry my spelling is probably not right) was also extremely friendly and the staff of the breakfast room did a wonderful job, always cleared away empty plates immediately and asked if there was anything we need. The breakfast buffet was quite a surprise - with so many tasteful things to choose from. So many different stations to pick fruits, pastries, pancakes etc. from. Everything fresh and beautifully presented.Thanks to the whole staff - for their friendliness and their dedication to the job!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Excellent service, food and pool in this established hotel. Although the rooms are furnished in a bit of old fashioned style, the hotel is clearly first class in everything. Every member of staff went beyond their line of duty and were especially helpful in finding us a restaurant for dinner that was open during a public holiday. Breakfast buffet was delicious and the pool a real gem - large and well set.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Really nice hotel with professional service. The food was good and tasty. Staff is very helpful and they are looking after their guest. The room was clean and comfortable. Top class Hilton service. Nice pool area, perfect for relaxing.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We've traveled extensively in Africa, the Middle East, the US and Europe at all levels and standards of hotels; the genuine and heartfelt attention given by the staff at Hilton Cyprus - from check-in to cleaning through dinner and breakfast personnel - this is the best experience so far. Bravo!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed two weekend nights at the Hilton Cyprus, earning a Diamond upgrade to a suite on the concierge level of the hotel.My check-in and arrival experience was very pleasant, with the hotel staff member greeting me authentically and warmly and acknowledging with grace my status as an HHonors Diamond member. Without needing to enquire about an upgrade, I was told immediately of my upgrade to a full suite.The lobby and common areas of the hotel are immaculately clean, spacious, and elegant. If you bypass the lifts nearest to Reception and use those at the end of the hall near the spa, then you are presented with a lovely view of a soaring atrium by the glass-fitted lifts and proximity to the Concierge Lounge. The lounge is comfortable but each time I visited at the weekend I did not find it to be staffed and also did not see any of the complimentary drinks that were advertised during the evening hours. This is a pity.My accommodations feature two separate rooms, one a seating and entertainment area, and the other a comfortable sleeping room. Each room has a full bath. I found the décor to be simple, yet elegant. As can be the case with hotels that have not had recent renovations, the number of electrical outlets was limited and indeed rather difficult to access.The property itself is quite nice, with a crowded car park and entrance opening into a luxuriously appointed lobby and further opening into the restaurant and pool area. The pool is a beauty to observe in the evening hours as it is charmingly lit.Reaching the old city of Nicosia is a bit tedious, as it can be done via walking at a brisk pace in 20 minutes or more commonly via an air-conditioned taxi. I'm informed that no one walks in Nicosia and I can appreciate that as the walks are poorly maintained and the temperature hovers near 40 during the summer months. I tested both and found that while walking was not unpleasant, that it certainly was not as convenient. Travel to the airport at Larnaca costs about 50€ via taxi or hired card and takes 45-75 minutes depending on traffic. It's easy to arrange via the hotel staff.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I just checked out of a short stay at Hilton Cyprus. Location is good, and the facilities of the hotel, which include a very nice swimming pool, allow for a combination of business and pleasure.The rooms are spacious and well equipped. The lobby area, the different bars and restaurants, the business centre and other services cater to all the needs the visitor might have.But what really sets this hotel apart is the extremely friendly, polite and professional service in all departaments. I didn't find during all my stay any employee whose attention level and helpfulness was less than excellent. They really made my day in several occasions.This is definitely the best hotel in Nicosia and I plan to stay here consistently in future visits to the city.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The hotel is nice and very well maintained and clean. The staff is excellent. Only downside is that it seems like it has not been renovated in quite a while and the aesthetics are 90s. But overall it's recommended, rooms are spacious and experience is good.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I visited Hilton Nicosia for business reasons.The place was really nice, all personel smiling and were very helpful and the entire Hotel premises were clean and nice. I strongly recomment the Hotel for your stay.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I stayed here on a business trip for 2 nights. The Rooms are good, they have swimming pool, WiFi. Breakfast was not that great, when you see you can lot of spread, but when you come to choose i found less items i can choose from.WiFi works most of the time, not all times. Service is good.Not sure why don't they provide at least 1 water bottle a dayFor me the stay was good, could have been better as it is Hilton (for the price we pay for)",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"Stayed a couple nights on business. The rooms are comfortable for a business traveller. I think that each room has a balcony which is nice. Breakfast was very nice with a good selection of cheeses, warm plates, fruits, etc. Service around to get coffee, etc. is not that great, but they get their job done. Overall hotel facilities are spacious and not too outdated. There's also a nice outdoor pool area. I'd come back here maybe for vacation.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We have lived in Cyprus for 3 years and whenever we are coming back on holidays to visit our friends we stay at the Hilton in Nicosia. You wont choose Nicosia for a beach holiday but whenever you might want to go there the Hilton is the best choice. I have travelled the world a bit but I have never experienced such a helpful, friendly and dedicated staff (one by one). It always feels like coming home and not like staying at a hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"The Hilton is comfortable for a typical business hotel but it seriously needs an upgrade. The rooms feel like something out of the early 90s (and the curtains out of the 70s) but the service and staff are very polite and helpful, and the pool side bar is a nice place for a quiet evening drink. Good coffee and breakfast at the buffet too.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,I have likely been a guest of the Hilton Cyprus over 40 times since 2006. Each visit I am received as an honored guest. They remember my name and my preferences. Their facilties are excellent. Their professional and service teams are outstanding. They have excellent facilties and they strive to make each and every visit memorable.,The Landmark Nicosia

The staff is kind and very welcoming and were careful all over stay.A short time after check in, cakes and drinks sent to our room OUT OF CHARGE as agesture of good will.

50,"We really liked this hotel and I’m sure this was helped by being upgrade to a lovely large executive room. Check in was just perfect. Greeted by name as a Diamond Hilton Honors member and immediately advised I had been upgraded. They should put this greeting in their training manual - perfect. Nice bowl of fruit, small bottle of wine and some other snacks in the room which was nice. Breakfast was good with a visit from the customer services manager to all guest making sure everyone was happy. This was a good touch. Large pool area with sun loungers although the pool was a bit on the chilly side. Location is ok. It’s on the main road south out of town so easy to get to if driving. A bit of a walk, maybe 25 minutes, to the old part of town and the city walls. Executive lounge was also good with good snacks plus some beer and wine for a couple of hours in the early evening. Late check out was allowed till 4pm without any hassle. The actual check out was good to with a little gift of local fruit in a small jar given to us. Nice touch.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,I booked into this hotel for convenience as I was on business. Unfortunately the airline left my bags in England but the reception staff could not have been more helpful and genuinely concerned. They not only suggested a great fish restaurant to eat at they also called the airport on my behalf without being asked to find out when my bags might arrive. Simply wonderful customer service. The room was fine and the overall experience has been fabulous. I wouldn’t normally choose a chain hotel but this has changed my view of Hilton.,The Landmark Nicosia

All day and all night, for every room throughout the hotel!! The temperature unit on the wall? Don’t bother, it just makes different levels of noise.My room is mega hot and I’m struggling to get any sleep at night. The (friendly) staff have provided a fan and explained that when it is refurbished the hotel will have an adjustable heating and air con system. But for the moment it doesn’t. I kinda think that paying top dollar for a 4-5 star hotel that advertises it has air con should give me access to air con. But apparently not, at least until the summer when presumably they will turn the system on. Traveller be warned...",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Another great morning in this hotel , where I went down from my room to the front desk and was greeted by smiles and they took care of my small problem.

50,"The experience started with an incredibly genuine and friendly warm hearted welcome from the Assistant Front Desk Manager (Maria I think), and this theme continued throughout a week long stay. I think I can say the most helpful, friendly and efficient service I have ever experienced ... the key was it all felt so genuine.As Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded to a superb 2 room suite. The decor and furnishings may look a bit dated in the pictures, but the rooms are in superb condition and while the furniture may be older, it is very high quality stuff and actually gives the hotel a cool retro vibe. The beds felt very new, and were incredibly comfortable. Yet another stand out feature was the high standard of housekeeping - this hotel is clean, really clean - I challenge you to find anything that doesn't exceed your expectations.The theme continued with breakfast, which was again excellent, good quality, lots of choice, coffee cups filled up without having to think (important to me as a coffee addict!!).Is there anything I would change? ... perhaps just the location, if you are a tourist. However it was a pleasant and easy half hour walk to the old town area, and there are plenty of taxi's. We had a car for the week, and there is plenty of parking (although the free parking is often full during the day, there is loads of space in the public car park at 5 euros a day.I guess the key test is would I stay here again - if I were staying in Nicosia, I would absolutely be staying here, without even looking anyway else.Hilton can be so hit and miss in Europe and North America - this hotel is the best I have seen - great job guys :-)",The Landmark Nicosia

I loved the restaurant, both the buffet and the a la carte menu. Delicious. The decor throughout is out of date, but the hotel is very well maintained, and it doesn't show any major signs of wear and tear. I can't vouch for the location because I mostly worked or stayed at the hotel. However, it was a short cab ride to the area where the local banks have their head offices, and probably a 5 minute ride to the main restaurant area. It's about a 10 minute ride to the Mall of Cyprus. VERY good value in the winter.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We traveled to Cyprus for st valentine s day and had one of the best experiences we have ever had. Upon booking we left a comment sharing that we only see each other occasionally due to our long distance relationship. Comment was not wasted.Upon check in George greeted us with a big smile and welcomed us in a friendly and professional manner, speaking English perfectly acknowledging my non greek speaking girlfriend. He dropped a hint about a potential surprise in and with our room which we quickly realise upon opening the doors to our honeymoon suite.The room was amazing! Vast and well decorated, satisfying our needs for the stay with not only one but 2 balconies. The jacuzzi in the room was the cherry on the cake!At the bar and the next day at the restaurant for the valentine s meal, Maria took really good care of us. Recommending us a bottle of Cypriot wine which we enjoyed so much, we ended up buying 3 of during our stay. An asset to your team.The valentine s experience was amazing! We had a fantastic 5 course meal with champagne. The food melted in our mouth! Tastiest food we have had in ages! The live music was an extremely beautiful touch, bringing our already fantastic experience to another level!Breakfast was from another world. A vast selection of food and drinks with friendly team members who could not stop giving us the perfect level of attention. From team members, to chefs and management!Having the opportunity to meet the head chef in the breakfast room was also a great touch.

50,"Briefly: nice, clean, well-kept hotel set apart by a staff and management who, to a person, displayed top-notch hospitality and made for a remarkable stay.For our three-night stay in Nicosia we chose Hilton Cyprus. As an HHonors Gold member I was upgraded to a huge suite with tons of space spread across the suite's two rooms. The breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent and something to look forward to each morning. There was a great selection of things across the dozens of items offered, including locally-made cheese, local honey, and lots of house-baked pastries. It was a feast.Where this hotel excels is its staff. The hospitality we experienced was unforced and from the heart; it's a rare treat in any hotel because it's impossible to train genuineness into anyone. And, every employee we came into contact with, from management to bell staff to housekeeping to restaurant waitstaff, all took responsibility for the guest's comfort. At breakfast each morning the head of housekeeping, the restaurant manager, and other members of management mix with guests and offer themselves for questions and feedback, an excellent touch noticeable to the guest.Special thanks to Maria--head of reception, who seemed to always be working--and the other staff behind the front desk and working as bell staff. They managed the front-of-house smoothly and with an always-friendly manner.To other aspects of the stay, the location feels a bit off the beaten path and, unfortunately, there aren't a lot of restaurants close-at-hand. We quickly learned how to get the bus into the old centre of town, which was a great help. Taxis are cheap, plentiful, and willing to get the guest to the center. Or, it's a safe, comfortable half-hour walk. But, if you're looking for a hotel that is in the middle of a city, this hotel has more of a suburban feel.I highly recommend this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"We had a lovely time at this hotel. It is luxurious, it provides all the amenities for all travelers,it has good dining, room service and leisure facilities, along with great service that exceeds expectations (especially the Front Desk team of employees).On another note, there are just a few things that let our experience down. We booked a family room which was spacious and comfortable. However, the love to details is missing; it was not cleaned properly. Rooms would require new furniture, fresh paint and new floor coverings.All in all, it is a really nice hotel for a city break. I would definitely go there again and recommend it to other people!!",The Landmark Nicosia

Hard to argue with that.Stayed here for 5 nights over Christmas as it was something different for is, after flying 10,000 miles to get here via 40 hours on planes and airports.They claim it is the best hotel in Cyprus, and having stayed at no others, impossible to comment on, but they’d be hard to beat I am sure.Got a very nice room upgrade as a Hilton Diamond member there on a special occasion, and a very nice and lovely welcome amenity and card. Large room with private balcony, and like all Hiltons, things are where you expect them to be – and work the way they should!!Super friendly staff on all levels, from desk to door staff to lounge and breakfast and the very helpful Elena, front desk manager who we arranged out booking through.The beaming smile and tall young Concierge lady at breakfast a delight – how she remembers guest names without looking it up, amazed me.Breakfast on ground floor was superb – top notch each day and attentive staff all over.There is a fairly large Executive Lounge there with light snacks and coffee and juices all day, and wine and drinks in the evening as well.A huge plus is there is FREE on site parking – near unheard of for any larger Hilton. (Oddly, making a local call for the cellphone to a local buddy was 3 Euro a MINUTE – which is insane.)We rented a car for 5 days for $US40 the LOT, with Hertz, inc all taxes and insurance and GPS from the airport, and drove around the island on our own. Maybe bookings are low around Xmas hence the rates, but $8 a day astounded me.As a cab ONE way at night from airport to Hilton costs near that $US40 with tip as it is 60km out, so the deal of the century that rental! Bear it in mind, as freeway all the way from airport to Hilton pretty much. Even if you never used the car except to go back to airport you are miles in front.Hilton is a little way out of downtown, so having the car is a huge plus.Lovely room, lovely staff, and a lovely staff. Can’t ask for more than that!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Very enjoyable stay in hotel. Staff were excellent and facilities top class. Stayed in a family room two adults and two children and room was very spacious and worked effectively. Hotel itself is fabulous and worth every penny.,The Landmark Nicosia

50,Very luxurious hotel. Service is very swift and professional and I left without a single complaint. Breakfast was very nice with a huge selection of food to choose from. Very central and is family friendly. Awesome hotel,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I spent 3 nights at Hilton Cyprus in November'17 on a business visit. Hotel is very nice - the best one in Nicosia as far as I know. Rooms are good, breakfasts excellent. It's a business hotel, not a holiday resort. There is a decent pool though which didn't function in November because of temperature outside. President of Bulgaria was staying there on his official visit at the same time as me.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Hilton Hotel was again delivering fantastic service and high quality from the minute I checked in - quality of internet service - the brekfast - ironing of shirts - the size and furniture in the room, two good big size queens bed in my room and I slept like a baby :-). Highly reccomend it.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"The staff is what makes this hotel. It's ideally situated and upon arrival the initial response is welcoming and stylish. The rooms are dated, things like shower curtains define its age. It's a bit 1980's. The staff is what makes this hotel what it is. Very friendly and welcoming. The bar food is good, the club sandwich is superb. Breakfast has lots of choices but because it's served in warm pots, the temperature quickly drops from serving area to table.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"In the past 6 months I staed 3 times in Jilton Cyprus. As in the last 2 aoccasions, this time im having a great time too. It is not just the familiarity with the tangible value and the facilities of this hotel. It primaraly the service, the atitude and the care. It is the same smile by the great people at the reception; the personal attitude and the most sweet morning welcome by the two young ladies at the restaurant hall; and all others..i am sure nex time I come the pleasent atmosphere and level of service will stay the same. Well done guys.. u r doing a great job.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"I stayed at the Hilton Cyprus for a couple of days whilst in Limassol on Business. The hotel is very conveniently located for the business district. Amenities were excellent, as was the quality of the breakfast. The front desk staff were extremely helpful. The only downside was the speed of service (or rather lack of it) in the bar one evening.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"the room is of a very good standard, very clean, very quiet. The bathroom is good. The check-in is efficient but the location is a bit out of town. It is a 20 minute walk to the heart of Nicosia. I would stay there again",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I was very pleased with the excellent service of the staff, and the facilities included. The gym, pool, spa, etc were all in excellent condition, with a good variety of equipment. The only problem I experienced was the WiFi connection in my room as weak, and the connection kept getting lost. In the lobby and other areas the WiFi connection was not a problem.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"Having stayed at the Hilton for both business and pleasure, I can honestly say this is certainly a 5 star hotel that provides a 5 star experience. During our stay we were fortunate to have the Real Madrid team in the same hotel, and even though we are not of celebrity status we still received the celebrity treatment. Our suite was large, very comfortable and very clean. We have also stayed in a standard and executive room and they are equally as good. Great location, great facilities set in a well maintained garden. Huge breakfast selection. We would 100% recommend a stay here to both business associates and family and friends.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,When I arrived the whole area was closed off as the Egyptian president was staying as were the Real Madrid football team.Despite having to walk the last 300m with my bags the welcome at reception was good and check in painless.Likewise the little cakes awaiting me on my room were a nice touch.I didn’t have time to enjoy the facilities too much but the Wifi was good and the bar nice.The minibar was well stocked and the room clean and large.The Only fault I could find was the shower was a stand in bath type (but it worked fine) but it had a shower curtain.I would however stay again next time I’m in Nicosia,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"The Hotel is very tired and in need of a complete overhaul especially the bedrooms and swimming pool area. All Staff were very good, helpful and attentive. The breakfast buffet was also good. The price of £350 per night was expensive based on quality of accommodation.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"We stayed here for a night as part of our honeymoon and the service and quality blew is away. A free upgrade on room was unexpected and the staff, especially George, were incredibly kind and thoughtful, providing everything we need. Just be aware that on Sundays the facilities have slightly different timings which we were caught out on, and don't confuse the in room dining brochure for the restaurant! Lastly it was very warm, and it took quite a while to be the temperature down in the room to sleep, but the bed was an absolute dream!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This hotel always delivers. Its staff is extremely helpful; friendly and anticipates guest needs. Nothing is too much for staff, which I appreciated even more following a recent accident. It feels like coming home and not like staying in a business hotel. The rooms are spacious and well kept. The public area (lobby) would benefit from modernisation i.e. new settees, if I was to critique anything. The pool is well kept and the spa offers good service, if you manage to book well in advance.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,We went to Cyprus for a wedding and chose this hotel as I hear it one of the best in Nicosia. As the wedding was not far we chose this hotel also.Staff were very polite from start to finish room was nice with a pool view. Breakfast was great lots of choice.We used the hairdresser which was amazing and we also booked flowers which was very nice to.I had a half back massage too not bad.Everything was good apart from the wifi it didn't work at all I did ask if they could help me to fix it but he said I have to call the i.t man so I jus thought forget it not worth bring someone jus for me. I did read someone else said the wifi was only good in the lobby but even I couldn't get wifi there it was terrible.That the only reason this hotel didn't get 5 starts from me.,The Landmark Nicosia

Thank you to the Hilton Cyprus team.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Me and my husband visited the spa for a day of treatments as a celebration.The spa area is nice but some parts need updating.. the changing rooms are tiny there is only room for one person to be changing at a time in the ladies. Unless u want to change in one of the two showers. On arrival we were met by a girl who said the spa reception wouldn't be manned until a little later when our treatments started, we had to ask for towels and wernt offered a robe or slippers which we thought was unusual. Once in the spa /pool area it become apparent it wasn't really a suitable place to relax. There is no reclining seats / chairs there are 3 sofa type chairs that you have to sit up right on. When it gets a little busier there is no where to sit. The pool and Jacuzzi was luke warm at that not the normal hot temp of a Jacuzzi. The sauna / hammam is nice but if someone is in there you have to wait as they normally lay on the stones on the floor there really isn't much room for someone else in there at the same time if sharing with a stranger.The therapist doing the treatments was very nice but didn't really speak English so it was a little difficult to get across certain things about the treatments, we wernt asked to fill in any consent forms stating any injuries or allergies which I thought was extremely dangerous, luckily i was able to communicate about a lower back injury u had and neither of us have any allergies. The treatments were done very well. We are at the bar near reception & the food was very good & good value.Overall it was an average time at the Hilton we have been to nicer spas in Cyprus whilst living here. Somthing that would massivly improve the spa area is having more seating around the pool and chairs that recline so people can really relax.Another tip would be a sign up on reception when a treatment is in progress asking for a little quiet, part of my treatment involved a loud conversation going on in the reception area which wasn't very enjoyable.Overall if they made some small changes too the spa area I feel it would be somewhere we would go back to in the future.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Quick, friendly and efficient service from all staff. The room was comfortable and the internet connection worked well. As this was a very short business trip with most of my activities outside the hotel, I was only able to experience the dining facilities during breakfast.

30,"Staff are lovely, very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is very good, plenty options. Paid €170 per night and expect a nice room and a good nights sleep. The rooms are large, plenty storage and a big balcony, hotel must be relatively old as rooms are a little tatty, decor is tired and is has a bunch of lamps to light room which I don't like due to need to wander around room to get decent light. I found the traffic noise intrusive and not conducive to sleep even with ear plugs. Air con is good but a little noisy. The shower is good although the base of bath is narrow. No glasses for toothbrush. Lovely lobby and restaurant area.",The Landmark Nicosia

The hotel is located 30 min by foot from the city center, but it's down hill, you can take the bus as well. Bus stop is around the corner. The area around the hotel was quiet in the evening. Very welcoming and helpful staff, I didn't have this experience so often.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"A standard Hilton with standard amenities - the stay was comfortable, but the rooms, predictably, pricey. My room was a standard one, and I'm sure there are nicer ones in the hotel, but my main bone to pick was that there weren't any vanity packs provided in the bathroom - I specifically didn't pack cotton wool pads to take my makeup off because I though a Hilton would have this covered!Amazing breakfast (like, really good, including a full fry-up made up of local dishes), with good selection of fresh food, with friendly staff (staff were friendly throughout the hotel).We were there as part of a large conference, and the conference centre was good, everything ran smoothly.There is a (very small) pool and some tennis courts at the hotel, but the area around isn't particularly nice, so you can't really go for a walk close to the hotel. The Old Town is about a 25-minute walk away, or a short taxi ride which will cost you 6-7 euros. However, the ride to Larnaca airport was much faster than expected, so it really is convenient to get there.It would be nice to have some free bottles of water in the room - having already paid for the stay, having to pay an additional 5-7 euros for a bottle is not something your guests appreciate. And the climate is such that you need to drink loads. The hotel shouldn't be abusing this, especially as it's not recommended to drink tap water.",The Landmark Nicosia

The welcoming was friendly yet professional and my HHonors Gold status was recognised by staff at the reception who offered me an upgrade to the executive floor. The room was spacious with a nice balcony and views to the city. During our stay, my colleagues and I, made use of their corporate centre and meeting rooms and on all occasions were satisfied with the level of service provided. Breakfast at the hotel is of particularly high quality and the girls greeting guests at Fontana Amorosa were particularly effective providing outstanding service. On the last day of my stay, I had lunch at the restaurant and the food was again of very high quality. I was most impressed when at check-out I was offered a gift - Cypriot delights!Thank you to everyone at Hilton for understanding and successfully enacting Cypriot hospitality! :-)",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed in this hotel several times for short business trips beginning in April 2016 and I was very happy with the ambience, amenities and service. It is ideal to rest after a hard day's work, has everything the business traveler needs and offers a truly excellent breakfast (don't miss it) with local products and yummy delights. It is also good for a drink late at night and an early swim in the lovely pool, especially when it is not yet high season and the hotel is not full. The staff is professional and ready to help. Nicosia has an interesting relaxed atmosphere and I enjoyed my trips there. I will certainly have to visit this hotel again for business purposes and I look forward to it.",The Landmark Nicosia

When I complained next morning I was reassured it was a once- off, that a plane load of tourists whose flight had been delayed bad to be accommodated but that they were leaving. Same tourists occupied the poolside for all of Sunday with no space for guests. When we returned that night we were surprised to find coaches of tourists from Glasgow - another delayed flight- filled reception noise and kids running down corridors until 1 am.We have to work - sleep is basic in a hotel - this is not a five star experience!",The Landmark Nicosia

10,"Having spent two weeks in the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus travelling via Larnaca, I turned up at the airport to return home to find that the aircraft had technical difficulties and hadn't left Glasgow. Facing a long delay, we were herded on a bus to the Hilton in Nicosia about an hour from the airport. A lukewarm buffet dinner welcomed us with a warning not to touch the mini bar. It was after 10pm so I went to my room and got ready for bed. I logged in to the internet as you get a code via the TV which welcomed me as Mr Thomas Cook. Obviously I had to contact my family to let them know what the script was and did so via Facebook messenger. In the morning we had a meeting with the rep who said we had to vacate our rooms for 12 noon. I went to reception to do this and was met by the most sour faced individual ever. Have you used the mini bar? Have you used the internet? No good morning or did you sleep well? I used the internet and he demanded 9.95 Euros which I didn't have. He then went through a list of currencies or payment methods and I told him I only have Turkish Lira which he seemed to baulk at. I can appreciate that he may have been a young boy when the civil war took place (maybe I'm being too generous here) but his attitude was appalling to say the least. This must be the only Hilton Hotel on the planet to refuse a currency.... 'we do not accept it!' I was snapped at. When I said you can take it or leave it, his frosty face turned to stone...lol. I told the Thomas Cook rep that its all I have and am more than willing to pay and it was a really bad ending to my great holiday! So come on Hilton.... born in the USA and advertises itself as a premier accommodation with a warm welcome and top customer service. Definitely not in my opinion! Hence why I don't stay in the South of this beautiful island. The people spoil it.",The Landmark Nicosia

Booked an Executive room, entitling me to use the Executive ""club"" facilities on the 6th floor. Quite good - nice eats and reasonable selection of beverages - but closed sharp at 7pm (!) so at least an hour too early by most hotel timings. The lunchtime buffet in the dining room was adequate, rather than the chef's boast of ""fantastic"". Beautiful pool area, and the location of the hotel in Nicosia is great, BUT the whole place is crying out for a total refurbishment! It is so dated - heavy wooden furniture in the rooms and elsewhere, public rooms look dowdy, and please what's with the FAKE flower displays everywhere - awful!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Well, it is a Hilton, so one should expect no less. But here, I need to add and emphasize, the fact that it's not only the charming Cyprus climate, not the luxurious hotel setting, it is, above all, the attitude of the people working here; eager to assist, polite, fast to respond to your request, understanding.The people in the reception are fast, efficient and kind. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, with delicious dishes, (the personnel and the F&B lady in charge, Anastasia) was very tending and kind, the swimming pool outside was very inviting (too bad I am on a business trip). The room is spacious, the mattress excellent. I need to warmly thank Mr. Petros Karadontis (Cyprus Hilton CEO, I believe) for his kind assistance. I am on a last-minute-business trip and he promptly made the arrangements to make me feel welcome and my stay comfortable.",The Landmark Nicosia

When we drove into the courtyard of the hotel in the early evening, I was not sure as yet as what to expect. After stepping through the entrance and into the lobby, I was surprised to find a beautiful lobby. The reception staff was very friendly, attentive and highly professional. I completed check in within a few minutes and went up to my room on the 5th floor. The room was large, very nicely laid out, well equipped with ll the amenities. Everything worked and I had a great night on a very comfortable bed. the next morning, I had a very good, healthy and tasty breakfast in the restaurant. Service there was also excellent - personal, friendly and very courteous. I checked out in the morning within minutes and went off to work, and then flew back home.

50,You can't go wrong. Staff are world class; I travel a lot and I could care less about facilities and amentities (which pretty much every hotel has).

The staff is uniformly incredibly helpful and cheerful, from the cleaning staff to the front desk to the bellman staff and dining room staff- all welcoming and offering to help.

They tried their best to make us feel comfortable.The swimming pool time was really good.The breakfast was also good and the team works there ensured all the time everything we need is available .It was so nice of the house keeping head ( Mother of Hilton Cyprus) to pass by every table to check if gusts do have any special requirements and that everything is in place.The hotel location is 7 minutes away from ledras in the old town by car and about 18 minutes walking .The reception head Maria so kind in giving us flexibility for check out time.I am recommending this hotel to all my friends visiting Nicosia and I would sure stay there again when I return.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,Had to stay in Nicosia rather than at the coast because of business. The staff at this hotel looked after my wife and 3 year old superbly. Nothing was too much trouble. Service is 5 star from all sections. Thoroughly recommend for both business and a family break,The Landmark Nicosia
50,Exceptionally customer focused and friendly staff. The best Hilton experience I had so far! (and I have been in 50+ Hilton hotels) They remembered us by name at breakfast. The head of housekeeping personally contacted to ensure everything is OK. All employees were really helpful.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The hotel is old school but very well kept. By old school I mean the décor and furniture which is manly wood and they even half a unit which showcased old plates like my grandmother has! The décor is old school but very well maintained and of a high quality. Service was excellent and one of the best I have seen. Hotel knew we came for our anniversary and went above and beyond with cake, champagne and more to welcome us. It was a great stay.We were on a bed and breakfast package. Breakfast was excellent quality and service excellent once again.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Convenient location in the centre of Nicosia. Pleasant hotel nicely furnished, great pool with outdoor dining. The breakfast was typical of the Hilton chain, plenty to eat and of good quality. The bedroom was good and good wi-fi.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Only a short stay if two nights but found everything to a very high standard throughout, service from start to finish was first class by all staff. The room was prepared and was welcomed by a super comfortable bed. The pool area is kept clean and tidy and there a plenty of sun loungers to go around.If you fancy some up market shopping there are a few shops located within the hotel including clothing and jewellery shops.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Central location, great service and breakfast. The gym needs refurbishment. Nice pool area. Good for business and family. I am travelling for business with a team and the feedback is very good. I will come back.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Wonderful hotel staff, far exceeded my expectations! The reception staff was eager to assist with anything I needed. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant was exceptional, that along with the wait staff made breakfast the best part of my day.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"A Hilton is a pretty safe bet--never especially flashy or especially dodgy. So when one stands out, it's pretty unusual. From the moment I was greeted until the time we left, the staff there was unfailingly helpful and generous.Maria, the head receptionist, helped me sort out a room change and was very accommodating. She then checked in on us, with treats for our kids. She was wonderful, and we felt welcomed.The property itself is fine. Nice pool, solid restaurant, standard and well-kept rooms. I thought the sloped tub in the shower was a little odd, but whatever! Nice people earn 5 stars.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed one day and night at this hotel. Overall I thought it was excellent. Great facilities, lovely breakfast, extremely friendly and helpful staff. My room looked a bit dated but was clean, comfortable, good a/c and a very good size and had all the facilities you would expect.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Stopped here due to flight issue. Very grand hotel, nice big rooms, two big single beds, nice bathroom but expensive for drinks., €8 a Keith and €11 single vodka (no mixer). Outdoor pool. WiFi free in reception otherwise ,€10 a day",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Went on a small business trip for a couple days, Initially the hotel had a grand appearance at reception and the lobby but this was shortlived after I arrived in my room. Old and in need of a complete renovation for the price I paid. The reception staff were respectful and helpful but definitely need to smile more. The room service was quite quick and the food was really good though. Showers still have curtains instead of glass cubicles. From what I see on tripadvisor, the management responses are just namesake and they don´t really seem to want to address issues brought to them on Tripadvisor.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"very polite and ready to serve personnel , nice location excellent breakfast , nice swimming pool and fitness center only 2 km from the old town. I strongly recommended for anyone wants to visit Nicosia",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We stayed here for two nights on a business trip. Upon arrival bellboy took our cases we were offered a drink whilst we waited to check in. Hotel manger introduced her self to us.Check in fast and efficient and the bellboy was very helpful and showed me how to work air conditioning where mini bar was etc. I had an executive room good size bed comfortable desk wifi was good all the time used with no issue.Room did not have best view of road and shops and petrol station but had balcony and I did not hear the road very often. Bathroom good size plenty of towels and toiletries and a bath robe.We ate in the restaurant by the pool. Service superb very attentive. Food was excellent highly recommend octopus and lamb cooked to how you like it. Chef even came out to ensure we were happy with foodBreakfast again was superb service huge choice of pastries hot food juices and cereal coffee and tea brought to you. Outdoor pool superb plenty of sun loungers with umbrellas towels and pool was like a warm bath good size and life guards on duty.Shops are also on site , check our fast and efficient. Would highly recommend staying her if in Nicosia",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Our flight was cancelled and the airline put us in this hotel for the night. Very beautiful clean hotel, well managed as they organised the whole flight into the hotel very quickly. Not somewhere for a long holiday I wouldn't think more for business trips and wedding. But beautiful place.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Maria Londou Argyrou will greet you at reception upon entering the hotel with that smile full of warmth and kindness. Aside from being prompt about her job she also answered several questions we had. We fell in love with a ceramic piece on display at the hotel counter...She directed us into town by calling a cab to find that particular ceramic we were looking for and knew exactly which store to obtain it from. Unable to find it there as it was discontinued we spoke with her when we returned. She then LITERALLY found management- which was the General Manager of the hotel- and asked on our behalf if we could have the display that was at reception- HE SAID YES! Unbelievable effort on her part! We spent two nights there and each morning on our way to breakfast she made it a point to greet us and make sure there was nothing else we needed during our stay.She also sent to our room a small patisserie plate full of Cypriot goodies! We just had to write about her and at the end of our stay we simply had to give her a farewell hug! Employees such as this are rare and it just shows Hilton does its best when hiring! Stay the same Maria and do not change any of your caring ways- you made our stay memorable! Every time we look at our ceramic ""yiayia"" we think of you-THANK YOU!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,The hotel has a very good pool area and the breakfast including their staff was amazing. All the staff were very attentive and could not do enough for me during my stay. I will definitely be back to stay here as I go to Nicosia on business regularly,The Landmark Nicosia

Friendly people, always with a smile to serve your every need, because they CAN do it the best way possible !! Would definitely stay there during my next trips, whether its business or pleasure, in Cyprus. Recommend it 100%.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I spent 1 night in this hotel. Overall this is a good hotel. My only advise would be to avoid rooms with view on the main street. This is noisy all night long with the traffic (the windows of the rooms, which look thick enough, are obviously not well isolated/installed).Check-in and check-out went smoothly with a smiling staff. This first process already gave me a good opinion of the hotel.The room was nice, well equipped (even 1 electrical plug for non UK extensions/cables). The safe was large enough for a laptop but maybe installed too high in the cupboard (you need a chair to access it...). The bathroom was fine with a good range of amenities. Also good bath gel and shampoo. Bed, pillows were good. AC was operating well and not too noisy.Breakfast was good/very good with a large choice of cold and hot food and beverage (as Hilton brand is used to proposing). Staff is smiling and customer focused.Outdoor swimming pool is beautiful and long enough to swim properly. Indoor swimmimg pool is smaller, more fit for aquagym. The gym area is separated in 2 rooms (weight and cardio) and well equipped.The parking is free. There is also a gas station in the same area, which is very practical when you have a car.On the whole a good hotel which deserves better windows in the room with view on the road.If you visit Nicosia, no need to use your car. Better to hire a taxi (6 to 7 Euros). And then walk around the city.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Hilton Cyprus is considered a top choice in a city that does not have that much choice for quality hotels.What i take away from my stay is the excellent service provided by the staff.The hotel is decent, the rooms are quite comfortable although in need of modernization.It also has one of the best swimming pool in town.All in all, i would stay there again if i go back to Nicosia.Pros:- Excellent service- Nice pool- Decent rooms- Great breakfast buffetCons:- Rooms need modernization- Complimentary water would have been appreciated",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Excellent staff and personal attention were second to none. I can't compliment the hotel on the quality of your people enough. This was the highest quality of service I have ever experienced and it is entirely due to the personality, professionalism and personal touch of your extraordinary team there. Would highly recommend you to anyone for business or personal travel.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"As Hilton honors guest, we spent a free night at the Hilton Cyprus in Nicosie. We arrived very early in the morning and they manage to give us a nice room with upgrade to executive and lounge which was very kind. The lounge is small but you have cookies, nuts, soft drinks, fruits in a basket and chocolate bars all over the day from 6 am to 11 pm. You can enjoy also a happy hour from 5 to 7 pm with 3 hot dishes, salads and fruits and local desserts with alcohol drinks and still soft drinks. The staff on the whole is really nice and kind and make you feel very well. The hiltonia club is nice with a fitness room and an indoor pool and sauna, jacuzzi and steam bath. The outdoor pool is great. The rooms are nice with good amenities in the bathroom. Except the noise of the street all night, our 1 night stay was perfect thanks to the staff.

50,"The consistency of delivering authentic service has been amazing at the Hilton Cyprus. We have been staying regularly for years visiting family in Cyprus and all the long time employees from the reception, bellmen, restaurant and Executive Lounge remember our names and make you feel mostly welcomed. Although the property might need some updating on decor, the cleanliness and maintenance is superb. It says a lot about the culture when he Executive Housekeeper is personally inspecting floors and asked us and others how we enjoy our stay and offers any assistance we need.My family feels at home at this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
10,"This is a 5 Star hotel only in name. The service is apalling, staff in bars and restaurants are jsut not interested in their guests. I don't mind paying good money for service, food and drinks, however this place charges top rates and offers the service of a 3 star hotel.Rooms are dated, something out of the 1970's, brown carpets, torn curtaind and old fashioned bathrooms.Don't stay here.",The Landmark Nicosia

The waiting time for food and drinks at the beach restaurant was very long. The pool area is amazing, nice big garden around, all very well maintained.

50,"I stayed a week for a work event and found the room very comfortable. The the service and food was generally good. The most impressive part for me was when forgot a gift which was wrapped behind in my room and only noticed two days after arriving home. Fortunately the hotel staff quickly located it and posted it back to me in the UK. I really appreciated their quick response, honesty and helpfulness.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Hilton Hotel is the most luxurious hotel I have ever been to. I was there in January, and it was cold outside, but inside it was nice and warm all over. The food was amazing and the service impeccable. I am very happy with my stay there and I would stay there again any day.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Only stayed here for one night but I certainly won't forget it. Lovely room, fantastic facilities. But the best things were the service and the breakfast. Breakfast was top-notch, I'd go back just for that!!!! So much choice and it was all delicious. The service was absolutely impeccable, that staff couldn't do enough, they were incredibly attentive. Special thanks goes to a member of the housekeeping staff (I think she was the head of housekeeping, unfortunately I didn't get her name). Upon hearing that it was my birthday she arranged a special birthday dessert to be brought to our table. It was such a wonderful thing to do and I was incredibly touched. If the hotel representative who replies to many of these reviews sees this, please do thank her again on my behalf. What a wonderful finishing touch to an excellent stay.

50,The most impressive part of this hotel is the staff. They are quite simply outstanding.Whilst the hotel hardware is typical of what you would expect from a busy 'corporate hotel' the soul of this hotel lies with the human capital. The staff were outstanding. The morning breakfast service was great and being greeted by Maria daily was such a treat.We will be back.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We have oringianally asked for a double room to stay over one evening and later reuired to accoodate another ""2"" family members. They receptionist was very helpfull.

50,"Visited for 2 nights as a base to explore the city. We are delighted we did, had a stunning 3 room suite on the 4th floor overlooking the entry to the hotel. There was a pleasant selection of toiletries, powerful over bath shower and super comfy bed. We made use of the restaurant both nights we were there which is generally out of character for us but i was so blown away by how friendly the team were we almost couldn't be bothered with the rest of the city - however we decided that maybe we should see at least some of Nicosia.We checked in a little early with no hesitation from the team, one of the rooms was ready so we ditched the bags and went out and gained the other room later - definitely worth the wait!! Some of the front desk team are learning their new roles and the manager clearly has an eye for talent as these were very amenable colleagues who are eager to learn and please. Not one negative here. Perfect.The executive lounge was a pleasant experience with snacks and drinks available at intervals through out the day. It's nice to feel a little special and the service it's self as well as the amenity delivered this.The restaurant service is second to none, we enjoyed an a la carte meal on the first night and a buffet delivered by friendly, attentive and not over bearing team. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Top marks once again.Breakfast was really impressive with chefs offering breads and pastries at the table, never seen this before and was very impressed with it! The housekeeping team asking if guests are happy about their rooms is a brilliant touch and once again, impressive!The spa is fantastic, sauna is powerful and jacuzzi is comfortable. Only used the men's so can't comment on the ladies.Parking for 48 hours 10€, in a capital city .... yes, we were shocked too!In all, I would visit Nicosia again just to stay at the Hilton Cyprus again and I was so pleased we did this.

The staff from the moment we checked in, to helping out during the wedding to the days following were amazing.....especially George at the Front desk. He treated us like he had known us for years. The breakfast buffet has a great selection. Each day they had slight varieties offered. The pool is great, water is just a little cold. The rooms are spacious, they have a few outdated details but nothing that would negatively impact the stay. The bed is super comfortable and the housekeeping staff did a phenomenal job at cleaning our room each day. Very happy we selected the property.",The Landmark Nicosia

Delicious buffet lunch.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The helpfulness of staff was notable in this hotel. Apparently this is the only five star hotel in Cyprus, and is a very nice hotel, but not quite on par with other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. Breakfast is excellent, with a good selection and nice outdoor location by the pool. Rooms are comfortable, technology is a little dated and I could not get my iPad to work via the HDMI on the (old) TV. About 20 minutes walk from Nicosia old town where I went most evenings during my short stay. Would recommend for a business trip but if on holiday it is perhaps not in the best location.",The Landmark Nicosia

As a HHonors Gold member, i really enjoyed this hotel. We have stayed as a family in a standard family room and it was large enough to locate an extra bed and a baby crib. Staff was very nice and very welcoming! We have stayed in other hotels the nights before and after, and for sure Hilton Cyprus was the one we had a perfect sleep! I will come back again!",The Landmark Nicosia

The check in experience was good. I got an upgrade to Executive room as the hotel was full for their standard rooms. Also, got a free access to the Executive lounge service but could not use the bar as it is only functional from 5 pm to 7 pm. But the lounge is open till 11 pm so you can relish on other beverages and snacks. The bed was comfortable and the alarm clock helps you if you have to get up early.

30,"The people who work here are fantastic, always got a smile and they will do anything to help you.The buffet breakfast is very good.This was my 5th stay and my last. The reason is very simple, you have no control of the temperature in your room. It was 22 Degs + in the last week in March 2017 and the air con was minimal, the temp control switch in the room basically just switched it on or off. They still had the heating on in the evening so when coming back the room was like an oven and the only way to get a decent temperature was to switch the heating control off and open the patio door and let the cool breeze work for you.We complained about this on leaving and we were not the only ones.The other one is the pool, closed as it is still winter even though folk are walking around in shorts and tee-shirts.Because of the problems we encountered with heating/cooling in the room, which is obviously centrally controlled, we will look for another hotel for our next business stay.The rooms could do with a make-over as well, outdated, stayed and in need of renovation.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"This is a beautiful hotel with lovely rooms, impressive lobby, gorgeous stores in the lobby, good restaurant and excellent staff. The room I had was superb. The whole hotel is in immaculate condition. The only thing a tourist should be aware of is that if you don't drive then the hotel is about a 25-30 minute walk to the historic sector. I was with a colleague who had rented a car so it wasn't a problem for us. But the location could be an issue for the average tourist. Of course, one could take a taxi. Staying at the hotel was a delight. If you have access to the Executive Lounge, it's very comfortable with good food in the evening. The wifi connection was perfect. Be sure you know that this is the Hilton on Archbishop Makarios street. There is another Hilton someplace else in the city.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Amazing service, awsome breakfast, spick-and-span rooms. Reception will go at extraordinary lengths to serve your unexpected needs (I suddenly came in need of a decent tie and the gentleman on duty brought me a dozen of his own to choose from !)",The Landmark Nicosia
30,The suite smelled weird and the carpets were old and dirty . The decoration was very old . The suite was spacious and the staff were polite and helpful .House cleaning was not very good. In the morning the cleaning ladies try to enter my room even if I had the do not disturb sign outside the door . The room service stuff was polite and right on time . The room service food was very good .,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The hotel is one of the nicer ones available in Nicosia, but the furniture and decor are looking a little dated. Some of the executive suites are right on a main road too, so traffic noise can be a problem.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"As a tourist wanting to explore Nicosia old city,the most important point in chosing a hotel is that it is centrally located.It says that it is centrally located on this site.However when i was given a map of the city on my arrival i realised that this is not in the city.In fact it is over 2km from the city,nearly 40 minutes walk each way,unless you constantly want to take taxis.This has an added problem.There are no restaurants within 20 minutes walk of the hotel.The 2 nearby are both closed.This means that you have to eat in the hotel.Not so simple.The main restaurant does not open till 730pm,not 7 as stated in the hotel directory.This means that there is just the hotel lobby where snacks are served till 7pm.So i ended up having a toasted cheese sandwich on 2 evenings.There is room service but no i do not want to eat in my room.So a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.It makes you wonder of the restaurant is operated for the convenience of staff or guests.As to the rest,well the room was comfortable,i slept well,the staff were fine and breakfast reasonable.However all that counts for naught in view of the unsuitablity of this hotel for tourists.For businessmen it is probably fine.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Loved this hotel. Great staff! Upgrade to the executive level because the club is very nice, and it included an amazing breakfast buffet.We stayed for a week and felt like this was home. And it is spotless.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"For the price they charged for a week day stay, and for being a Hilton brand.. rooms are very basicWe had an executive suite supposedly, so I wonder what the basic rooms were like.Rooms were small and very basic, but clean.Executive club access was for sure not worth it either. So if you have a choice, don't book the executive club.Breakfast was however very good and the staff were very friendly too. They made up for everything by giving us little gifts at check out.Would I stay here again... not sure",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The staff is very friendly - maybe the ladies at the breakfast restaurant a bit too talkative, especially if it's still quite early and you don't feel like talking.The room is clean and tidy, yet the furniture is quite old and the bathroom looks like being made in the 70s.Good location. Quite the place to be for many corporate meetings - if so, go for breakfast before they do, otherwise the place gets very loud!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,All staff are highly professional and engaging in this friendly home from home hotel. Nothing is too much trouble and they genuinely care and remember past guests. Best hotel in Nicosia by some distance.,The Landmark Nicosia

40,I often stay at the Hilton for business. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. They are willing to go out of their way to help you. Breakfast is good. Has a gym and nice outdoor pool. The rooms are ok. But in general the hotel could really do with refurbishment. The decor is from the 1980s. But the high quality of service outweighs the faded decor. Whenever we had a problem with the room Etc they immediately found a solution.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"nothing to say but Excellent.......in terms of rooms, facilities and staff which really take very good care of any guest even in all small things. although the location is not like budget hotels in lidras street, but taking a bus just beside the hotel and with 4 or 5 stations you will be there, so not a big deal.",The Landmark Nicosia

Breakfast is top notch with tons of staff available.Checkin and checkout was a breeze. Definitely a competitor to any Kempinski in Europe.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This hotel clearly provides itself on service cleanliness and cistomer wellbeing and throughout the stay staff were friendly and professional. The only downside was the gym which is tired, some equipment broken and not as good as the other Hilton in nicosia. However it's a great hotel location good for meetings and definitely felt st home",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"An exceptional hotel with awesome service (reception, restaurant, room maids, conference). I have never been in a hotel which offers such an outstanding service. Breakfast was delicious, reception was very kind and helpful, room maids took care of cleanness and guests with a great devotion. I had a very early arrival and late departure and personel did their best to help me while I was waiting even then when I had been already checked out. I can’t remind myself whether anyone, any when took care of me with similar attentiveness at home :)",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"The location is good, the hotel nice, but the real attraction is the staff. They are the most helpful, cheerful and nicest to be around. Every time I am in the area, I stay there because of the staff. The rooms are nice, but the people are great.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"It was a comforting stay at Hilton. My family enjoyed the environment and food. The courteous staff gave a homely feeling. Our visits to Nicosia downtown, Limasol Marina, Lafkara and Hala Sultan Tomb as well as old town in Larnaka were very entertaining.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The service at this place is top notch. Each staff member I met - from the concierge to the restaurant staff were engaging and customer oriented. The rooms are well furnished, clean and well appointed. The one issue I had was with the noise level in the room. I could hear people in the room next door talking till late at night - and they were doing it at a normal volume.The restaurant was good, but only opens for dinner at 7.30 pm. Before that you can have some light fare at the bar. Daily breakfast is as expected, neither under nor overwhelming. The old part of town (Ledras Street) is about a 20-25 minute walk to from the hotel. Lots of dining options in that area. the area near the hotel is somewhat barren with very few eating options.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Very nice hotel,cleanliness 100%,beds comfortable,breakfast of very good quality. The only thing which needs updating is indoor spa area (too small and outdated), but I understand it's Cyprus-most of the year people hang out by the outside pool which is big and nice. Overall experience very good! Recommended!",The Landmark Nicosia

In the morning, for breakfast, the reception ladies are amazing, the two young ladies in charge make you feel very important, they guide you through the menu and are ready to provide personal compliments and suggestions. the menu is excellent and delicious. The front desk personnel is very friendly and keen to assist with any request you might have. The fitness room is updated, clean and comfortable. I would prefer though a bit more smiling and friendly personnel at the reception of the fitness hall and some more professional assistance. There was no gym coach available at all.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"There is no big difference between executive suites and ordinary rooms. Excellent interior, all facilities on your disposal, location is nice, surroundings really great. What fascinated me the most are people. Entusiasthic, polite, always available for help. There is no ""fake"" kindness. These people are really working hard and make you to feel special.

50,Difficult to know where to begin. Rooms are spotless and staff very efficient & friendly. Excellent facilities. Obviously being winter the outdoor pool isn't available but thats understandable. This hotel will be my first choice whenever visiting Cyprus again. Its a cut above the rest.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Great service, the hotel might be a bit old fashioned, but the service you get from the staff covers it all. Very peaceful, 20 minutes walk from the hotel to the downtown area. The spa is great, and the masseuse Vera was very efficient and professional, highly recommended.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"It is not the best hotel in the world but it's best hotel on Cyprus. There is no alternative. Very friendly services, good bar and restaurant on the ground floor, but if you will ask to laundry your clothes in the weekend you will receive rejection. They don't work on weekends. You can ask to order taxi but it's possible that taxi will not wait you at entrance in needed time. Everyone will smile you and offer help but they will not run and hurry up, they will continue to smile very freindly and will ask wait some time.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Great experience and service. Breakfast is great, got the best scramble eggs ever. Dinner is very good, but a bit pricey as compared to prices downtown outside the hotel. Service is great, very nice, profesional and warm. I didnt have the chance to try pool or gym",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"I had a pleasure to stay 3 nights at Hilton. I have to say it was great experience. All staff was more than helpful and friendly. Especially staff at breakfast restaurant was amazing, their hispitality was outstanding.Polish chef made me pancakes every day (delicious! Ask for those and you won't regret), got fresh squeezed grapefruit juice every day, there were a lot fruits and veggies (good option for vegetarians, but vegans will also have chance to have good breakfast). Also, food at room service was very good. I've ordered grilled halloumi cheese with tomatoes in pita with french fries and I have to say it was good match (even tho there are not many vegetarian options), service was very quick. Good was bit pricey, but definitely worth the money.My room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. Bathroom was not the biggest, but big enough. Amenities were great, I asked for shaving kit and vanity set and I got fiew of them. Ladies who cleaned my room were very, very nice and helpful.Outside swimming pool was little bit too cold by then, but the inside pool was perfect (note that there are various activities in that pool, so it's not available all the time - especially when they have toddlers swimming lessons. After which pool smelled a little like a smelly diaper), empty almost all the time.Stay at Hilton was one of the best, even I was on business trip there, I felt like on vacation. The only minus I have noted during my stay: I had no free bottled water in my room. Beside that everything was great, and I hope chance to be guest at Hilton Cyprus again.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This hotel has always been outstanding but there appears to have been a drive on perfecting the quality of customer service. From arrival to departure staff interact with guests whether it be in the restaurant, the lobby or the executive lounge. The food in the executive lounge is also varied and caters for all tastes. The rooms are large and and reasonably well equipped ( the removal of the desk laptops has never been explained) and executive rooms have a few extras including a welcome gift, fruit, flowers and bottled water. I have never been upgraded to a suite as I am in other Hiltons but assume they are even more luxurious. I recommend this hotel to all potential guests and it is ideally situated for Nicosia centre and also Larnaca airport.",The Landmark Nicosia

Also there was free WiFi all around the hotel.Breakfast was excellent, with multiple choices for a vegetarian like me... hot immediately-prepared according to request waffles are offered to guests..However, the most important thing to be mentioned is the hotel staff.. all were very welcoming and friendly, smiling and helpful.. they would notice any need of yours and immediately come and offer help, without waiting for you to ask .. specifically the staff at breakfast they were excellent and super friendly.I highly recommend this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We are regular visitors to Paphos but have never been to Nicosia so at the end of our recent trip, we decided to spend a night there and chose the Hilton Nicosia as our base to look around. As others have said, the hotel is a little dated but it didn't matter as the staff were all superb, friendly and incredibly helpful. We had a standard room which was an impressive size and very comfortable. As Diamond members, we had access to the Executive Lounge with happy hour from 1700-1900. It was New Year's Eve and extremely busy but the staff did a wonderful job of replenishing everything and the food quality was excellent. We ordered room service later with some souvlaki which was piping hot and delicious. Breakfast the next day was plentiful with the usual full English buffet in addition to a huge choice of cheese, salami, fruit, yoghurt, pastries and we could have things cooked to order as well. We spent the morning exploring Nicosia before an extended check out later in the day which was hugely appreciated. Parking at the hotel was free with lots of spaces despite the hotel being full and there's an overflow area for which you will need an access card from reception to avoid being charged. Not many negatives - the room was a little warm and the aircon didn't seem to make much difference. Maybe it's because the hotel is dated but the soundproofing wasn't great and we could hear noise from other rooms when we were in our room. There was a long hair in the bath and an even longer one on the bathroom floor neither of which were ours but maybe they stowed away inside the clean towels and fell out when they were put in place. The food items in the self serve breakfast buffet were luke warm, a common problem at most Hilton properties but generally outweighed by the cooked to order solution. We were on our way down to try the indoor pool but were told it was closed due to it being New Year's Day which was disappointing. When checking out, we noticed we had been overcharged for room service (€25 for souvlaki instead of the €22 advertised on the menu, plus the €3.50 room service charge which we were expecting) but this was quickly rectified when we pointed it out. Other than these minor issues, we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay here and will happily return again in the future.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Good hotel, no other similar alternative around. Open air swiming pool. Good territory, good location. You can check out any time you want. Very good for business trips. Hilton as usually good. Some good restaurants aroud",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I can't say enough about my experience at this Hilton property, other than to express what a standout.As a gold member perhaps I received extra good care, but from the moment we arrived the attention received, attentiveness of the staff, and willingness to please us was over and above, and I feel that this is simply the approach regardless.The most impressive fact was that all of the staff from the to front desk manager, to restaurant manager, and everyone on their respective teams, all gave us a level of service which is indicative of any top 5 star chain and even the best could learn from. Even the porter was amazing!The hotel itself is a little older but well maintained and appears to have had some remodeling. We were in a Junior Suite which was spacious and well appointed and clean. While rated 5 stars (possibly the only one of its rating in Nicosia) there are a few elements which could be slightly improved upon, but the staff more than overcomes any of those elements.Breakfast was phenomenal and once again the service and attention bowled us over. The staff couldn't do anymore to end over backwards and please.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We had a wonderful time at the Hilton with our 3 month old visiting for a friends wedding. We took a family suite where upon arrival a travel cot with small blanket was already prepared. The room was spacious and overlooked the car parking side but quiet.Due to sleeping arrangements with the baby we ordered room service for dinner several times and really enjoyed the village salad as well as pasta options. Breakfast had a wide variety of options including creating your own omelette which we tried too late on the last day and was delicious. We also can't thank the head of housekeeping enough for being able to launder our babies clothes with no access to a washing machine this saved us packing a suitcase full of dirty baby clothes, and was a unexpected highlight to the trip.There is also a lovely Baklava and sweet shop to the right of the hotel and small local shop where we were able to buy nappies and other baby items reasonably.Thank you for our lovely stay!",The Landmark Nicosia

Customer service is clearly important to the staff which is clear from the first-class way they treat their guests. For me personally, being a breakfast person, I cannot speak highly enough of the range of food, beverages and fresh fruits and vegetables provided every morning - all while taking in the view by the beautiful pool.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The treatment we enjoyed fm the hotel personnel during our three nights stay is second to none and made us feel like nobles. No matter if the venue itself leaves you with a rustic feel, it is very unlikely that you will meet anywhere else such a first class professional service combined with the most friendly attitude. It is worthy to mention that in our first night when we returned to the hotel very late and the cuisine was already closed, they were still kind enough so as to prepare some delicious hot dishes exclusively for us two hungry guests... Most Highly recommended!!!",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"This is a pleasant hotel with good service good for business and leisure. The rooms are well appointed and spacious, good WiFi all round.

She is warm, smiley, enthusiastic and very good at her job. Thank you Maria.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,This hotel is a typical Hilton in many ways. The hotel is well built with good sized rooms and large reception areas with a coffee bar. There is a outside pool and an inside one as well as a car park albeit probably a little too small. The layout of the hotel is good with a variety of shops and the staff are extremely helpful both within the hotel and at reception.The downside is probably that there is only one restaurant which is primarily buffet but includes an al a carte option. The menu is very much a standard international menu and not particularly interesting. There is a bar which is segregated from the restaurant and the reception and includes tv screens covering sport but this is generally pretty empty.Generally a good hotel and a good choice when you are going to the business area of Nicosia.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Hilton Cyprus is proof that warm, friendly and personal service can also be found in big chain hotels. From the reception personnel to the dining room team, everyone is kind, friendly and attentive. As a Diamond member i have access to the executive lounge, and the dinner canapes there are, in my view, among the best, if not the best, of all Hilton's I've been in. They room, while not ultra modern, are always clean and well appointed. Breakfast is plentiful, although I wish they would stop serving that soggy bacon and start doing it crispy, the American way. But that's just me.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I'm staying at the Hilton Cyprus for a work event. The entrance is lovely and a warm welcome received from staff. The rooms are good, breakfast also very nice. We have been using the conference rooms which are perfect for the event, and also very beautiful, I can imagine them being good for a wedding or similar too. Service is a highlight, friendly, warm and very helpful.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"I always stay at the Hilton when visiting Nicosia and on my recent business trip I spent 4 memorable nights out here.You see, it is not just a superb hotel with an air of grandeur and classic splendor, but it happens to be the island’s flagship hotel. A top-notch five-star and top choice of world leaders and VIPs who can be spotted sipping chilled beverages or dinning at the signature restaurants of the hotel. So easy to bump into them.AWARDS: Just for the record –Hilton Cyprus has been recognized as Cyprus’s Leading Business Hotel for the fourth consecutive time at the 23rd edition of the prestigious World Travel Awards, recognized across the globe as the most prominent and comprehensive benchmark for excellence in the industry.LOCATION: Only minutes’ walk to the city center, at one of the most upmarket, leafy avenues of Nicosia. Taxi fee to the heart of the shopping center costs €6.00 but buses pass by every 20 minutes as well. On a nice day, it is a matter of 15 minute walk.CHECK-IN: Quick and efficient.SERVICE: Top notch! I felt the Cypriot hospitality at its full, felt valued and respected and enjoyed high quality personalized service from the staff and management. I skip many names as they are so many, but extra credit goes to Michaella, Marta, Stelios the Executive Chef and Christos Ioannides.AMBIENCE: Elegant, classy and so inviting and friendly at the same time. From the Gucci bags to the Cartier jewelry, the Hair and Beauty Salon, the impressive lounge and ostentatious lifts, the interior, -facilities and sumptuous furnishings in general, give guests the option of never having to leave the hotel.SUITE: I had the corner King Junior Suite # 569. Extremely spacious and nicely furnished with partial city, pool and garden views.It was more like a luxurious apartment actually, (67m²/721sq.ft) with a separate living room and a bedroom furnished to the highest standards of the Hilton quality and style.With access to the Executive Lounge and high-speed internet I was totally spoilt the 4 nights I was here. Nothing was missing, an eloquent silence in an amazing ambience and with so many friends around ….what’s not to like!Flowers in the room, a platter of fruit and wine were mostly appreciated.From the stunning king-sized Hilton Serenity bed that assures a restful night’s sleep, the writing desk, the two plasma TV sets, the coffee making facilities, iron/iron board and many more, it is hard to find fault.Crispy bed sheets changed daily, fresh towels, fluffy robes and slippers and Yes! The decorative towel folding that adds a fancy element and an extra feel of pampering is back. A huge thanks to Maria Christodoulou the supervisor of the Housekeeping but also Dora and Nandia who looked after my suite.Convenience here blends with comfort and reality mingles with fantasy, only to create the unique atmosphere and the perfect balance between luxury and homely familiarity. I could go on and on writing about this experience if it wasn’t for the word limit.HILTONIA CLUB & SPA: I never bothered stepping out of the premises or felt the need to get to any of the several restaurants that I was invited for a tasting experience. Moreover, there was no reason to do it.I spent most of the time sunbathing by the beautiful pool, used the fitness center once and the sauna twice.Downside, the Jacuzzi and steam-room. I felt it was a waste of time to remain in both since the pressure of the first was extremely low, and similarly the power of steam was so little, reminding me similar steam we have at home after a hot shower. Both need attention.Finally, the so called ‘relaxing room’ has only the name.It has to be furnished and decorated accordingly, while ladies should be strictly prohibited from leaving their belongings exposed out there, otherwise there is no reason to exist in the state it is now.TREATMENTS: The beauty centre has a tantalizing Spa menu to help energize and relax, depending upon your special needs. I went for the 60 minute Time Interceptor facial (€75.00) –Face, neck and décolleté area, but I also had the Classic Back Massage (30 min. €50.00).Elena my professional therapist for years, eased away the muscle tension, and when I left the treatment room I felt like I was walking on air.With all this pampering and care, I want to thank the team of the Spa, Pieris and Elena.BEAUTY SALON: Zak Hair Designers & Beauty Saloon is based at the Hilton and is extremely popular.You can relax knowing that your new hairstyle (men and women) is in the capable hands of qualified professionals whose aim is to deliver a complete hair and beauty experience from hair cutting and styling to waxing and more.I had been neglecting my hair lately and took some time while here to treat myself a fresh new look. I felt pampered and special and let Andy give me a trim while Fivo gave the coiffure hair-do.Whether you just need a trim or a colour refresh, or are in a mood for a dramatic makeover, one visit here, will have you feeling fabulous and turning heads!EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: Residents of the executive rooms and suites can benefit from this specially designed area where they can enjoy complimentary breakfast, tea, coffee, cakes, canapés, but also alcoholic drinks & cocktails, selection of fruits, newspapers and Internet access.This year after a long time the lounge evokes once again a pleasant and friendly atmosphere and has regained its old glamour.RESTAURANTS: Breakfast here is a delectable feast and is taken at the Fontana. There’s anything one can imagine, plus healthy options appealing to guests with specific dietary preferences.FONTANA RESTAURANT: (All-day dining)At a pleasant and chic interior with a cozy ambience, breakfast buffet was an utter delight and the service top notch as always. Waiters, were on hand at all times, even cooks and chefs were out daily. Team work and a personal approach with guests.DINNING: I was here with friends dining out by the pool and our choices were from the a la carte menu. (Readers can find my extended review about my tasting experience under the restaurant’s name).CHARITY EVENTS: Similar events take place quite often here at the Hilton. I experienced one such while I was there. Together with several other guests we tasted delicious cakes over a cup of coffee or tea. The money raised was offered to DM Thomas Foundation to help transform the lives of young people across Europe.ROUND AND ABOUT: Almost everything of interest lies within the historic walls, where a labyrinth of narrow streets reveals churches, mosques and evocative colonial-style buildings.The Archaeological Museum with its extensive collection is considered the best in Cyprus and shouldn’t be missed. Designer shops and upmarket restaurants are in abundance, while buses and taxis are never far away.Nicosia is an enticing city and is ideal for experiencing what modern Cyprus is all about. The ancient walls, traditional restaurants and an increasingly vibrant and young cafe and cultural scene effectively showcase the city’s basic make-up.IN ALL: The Perfect city retreat! With stylish rooms and suites, sumptuous furnishings, fine dining, squash and tennis courts and proximity to Nicosia’s Old City, make for a tempting package. The Hilton Cyprus is unique, as it provides the very best for the business clientele and holiday-maker.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"This is a typical Hilton. Clean, good service, good breakfast, decor a little tired but it is very, very close to a major room and all the executive rooms are so close to the road that the nosie makes it difficult to sleep with an open window.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,Excellent hotel with professional service and very clean rooms. The staff was more than polite and very caring. The only problem is that the hotel is about 1.5-2 km far from old city and it is not very easy walking that distance every day,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"First rate hotel, with staff that are extremely caring. Food is excellent, but range of choice could be greater. Standards of comfort and cleanliness are excellent. Wifi connectivity was great. But different hotel departments need to communicate with each other better to deliver superb experience.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Staff at the Hilton are fantastic. Can't do too much for you. Sometimes their concern to ensure you are enjoying your stay is a bit overpowering, but better than the alternative! Very comfortable rooms. Good breakfast. Executive lounge is excellent, with complimentary drinks and food between 5pm and 7pm. Walking distance to the centre of town or a €6 taxi ride. I've been a regular there on business over the past 3 years and would gladly go back",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The hotel is almost perfect.It was very clean.Breakfast is no good if you are on a diet, because you want to eat everything.The employees were very polite and helpfull.The hotel is 1.5km from the old city but this is no big problem because on the way are shops to visit.It was a perfect stay",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"Having visited Hilton Cyprus for a conference, I must admit that my experience is clearly event-based, but that doesn't change the fact that the rooms were cozy and nice (with very comfortable beds), the space itself open, with a lot of meeting possibilities in the lobby and that the staff was extremely nice and helpful, especially for those of us who were rushing between workshops and meetings, never exactly sure where to go. Definitely a good hotel for a big event!",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I recently stayed here and attended a conference on the premises. It was a great experience. I loved the pool and spa facilities and the spaces, in general, felt like they had a little more culturally-specific charm than some other Hiltons. I had a great time overall and would recommend it to anyone.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I was recently at a conference which was being held at the Hilton Cyprus in Nicosia and stayed at the hotel for 5 days.I have stayed at lots of Hilton's - both in the UK & abroad but I have never stayed at one as nice as this. It is a large hotel with loads of facilities including a great outdoor pool. My hotel room was really good - the bed was large and comfortable and the balcony good. The staff at the hotel were all great - reception staff, bar staff, waiters etc.My only gripe was that food for vegetarians was limited.I would recommend this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The Property is very well maintained, has a classic new look, the lobby area is very spacious. The room I was upgraded to is large also very well kept, very clean. Staff are very helpful. The hotel has a nice outside pool and inside pool a full service Gym and Spa, unfortunately my time in Nicosia did not allow me to use those facilities.It is in a good location to the city center.I got a street side room, although it is double door with a balcony it is little bit noisy with cars passing by. The Hotel has a an executive floor and Lounge open from 5pm to 11pm serving bite size food till 7pm nice open space atmosphere.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"PROS:1. Comfortable bed with excellent AC. Best sleep I have had in a long time.2. Good variety of English TV channels3. Fast internet (register to be a Hilton Honors member before you book so internet is free)4. Wonderful breakfast.5. Staff is very helpful. From the gentleman in the Executive lounge to the young lady seating me at breakfast, great staff! If you plan on walking to the historic district, ask the staff for a map and tips etc.6. Get a room with executive lounge access if you plan on having a few cocktails. The lounge has enough food to count as a dinner meal. Access also includes a voucher to use for breakfast in the lobby. Not many restaurants nearby for breakfast. Cocktails/wine are included in the lounge from 5pm - 7:30pm. So the price for a room with lounge access could count as the price for evening drinks, dinner and breakfast.VERY MINOR CONS:1. It's not in the historic district (Ledar St), which is where all the action is and historic sites, including bars, cafes, shops etc. However, you can get to Ledar street by a 20 min walk. You can easily spend days in this area.2. Strange to have carpet in the hotel room. Just not my taste for a hotel room.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Three things make a difference for me in business trip accommodation - desk, lighting and bed. The hotel gets a tick on all of these. Ideally the desk chair would be great too, but given everyone has different preferences for a chair I just add a pillow as needed. I did use a pillow in this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I stayed here on business. It is well located for the clients I was visiting.The rooms are pleasant with balconies overlooking the pools.Front desk staff are efficient, but not overly friendly.

50,"We come to Cyprus often. We stayed a few times at the other Hilton in town. This one is 100 percent better. This might be the best managed Hilton in which I have stayed! Excellent staff, facilities,F&B, etc. Well done.Not too far from Old Town, a must do for eating and bar hopping at night.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"This is a very large hotel about a 20 minute walk from Ledras street. The location is fine for business etc but there isn't a whole lot around the hotel I.e you'd need to walk a bit to find a coffee shop or high street shops- although they do have a small shop in the hotel.Staff were excellent most of the time. In the restaurant they were a little inattentive. Having asked for the bill on two separate nights it never came and I had to go down to the desk to pay. Also the first night I was under the impression from the matire'd that that night the buffet was my only option; but it wasn't. The next night they tried to push that on me again and I almost had to argue with them that wasn't what I wanted. Food was reasonable in the restaurant but seriously over priced and very expensive.The breakfast is decent enough with a good selection.The rooms were fine and had lots of tv channels to choose from.I would have liked to have used the pool but it's very open right in front of the terrace so everyone can see you having your evening dip! Although this shouldn't really put you off.Overall for business I'd say this is a good hotel - it's very professional, tidy and staff are good and most of the clients from what I could tell were business people but if you were a family staying in Nicosia for a few days, whilst it would probably suit your needs there may be better, more family orientated hotels for you.",The Landmark Nicosia

The newly renovated room I stayed in was light and refreshing, and despite Nicosia being inland, this hotel had a coastal quality to it. This hotel wouldn't be out of place in Larnaca.The location precludes you from exploring the city on foot, but as taxis are quite cheap it is not an issue.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Could not fault anything with the hotel. From the helpful and cheerful staff, great amenities, clean & newly renovated room and terrific restaurant all in in handy location. We always stay at the Hilton when visiting Nicosia as it is by far the best hotel in Nicosia. This was our sixth stay in this hotel and we enjoyed every minute.The staff was amazing, especially the team in the breakfast restaurant and at front desk!!! They were attentive to all of our needs and always pleasant to interact with throughout the stay. The bed and rooms were very conformable and pleasant. We got a package that included the breakfast buffet and access to executive lounge. The meals were incredible! The buffet breakfast was plentiful, delicious and an excellent value.This hotel offers such a choice for breakfast that would make many 5 star hotels very envious. A wide selection of grilled options such as delicious seafood, good quality steaks, imaginative salads and tempting desserts is available for dinner.This is a popular hotel location so there were parties on the weekend but the noise did not bother us as rooms seemed to be insulated well.Overall we felt very special and cared for. Will definitely come back again!The only downside is the hotel is quite expensive for an overnight stay.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"The hotel is very-very old. You can feel it almost everywhere. Wi-fi is free only in lobby and in rooms it costs 10 euros per device per day, as far as I remember, which is sooo not 21st century. The breakfast though is nice. You have a selection of freshly made Cypriot pastries and pies, fresh juices, nice coffee and great welcoming service. And they have a couple of pools and spa. But overall the hotel is too overpriced.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"not a classical Hilton , an old hotel with nice pool , gym etc.good service ,the rooms are old and very unpleasantbreakfast is great and its clear that the staff is always willing to help.compare to other hotels in Nicosia it may be good but compare it to Hilton its not .",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Hilton Cyprus is very nice old hotel, not far from the center of Nicosia. Rooms are spacious, nice and clean. The staff is very friendly and this applies both to the reception, and the breakfast room. The overall impression of the hotel is that it is a high-class luxury old hotel, which is carefully maintained and which takes account of all the relevant details. However, this hotel has some major lacks. In the rooms it is not possible to regulate temperature, which is unusual for a hotel of this class. There is a button for the temperature, but it has no function (it turns in a circle). Air conditioning can only be switched on with high or low fan speed or to turn off. The temperature can not be set. Other unusual lack of hotel of such class is that the bathroom has no shaver socket. If you want to shave with an electric razor, you have to do that in the room! I must admit that I do not remember that I ever was in the hotel where the bathroom has no shaver socket!Breakfast is excellent with a choice of dishes that can meet everyone's expectations.The hotel is very expensive, and this is especially true for the mini bar. A bottle of plain water, which normally costs € 0.50 in the room is 6.50 €!When choosing the room you should look for a room that is away from the main street. The main road can be noisy at night because of relatively heavy traffic. The windows and balcony door do not have good sound insulation.",The Landmark Nicosia

We are always very well looked after and I can't recommend this hotel enough.But this time a member of staff made our stay even more special. His name is Christos Joannides, the baker of the hotel. I went the extra mile to ensure that our breakfast is beyond perfect. He memorised quickly what I like and without saying anything, he brought it along. What an amazing start to a day. Even on our last day, he made sure I don't leave without my grapefruit and recipes of tradition dishes of Cyprus. I believe he is also the same chef who looked after my in-laws who also stayed at the hotel and wanted some special olive bread.Staff like him make the stay even more memorable and enjoyable.Can't wait to come back.Lovely greetings from Peter and Bianca Malone",The Landmark Nicosia

40,We have stayed before and always find the staff very welcoming and helpful. As my partner is a Hilton gold card member we had executive lounge access which is great for early evening refreshments. The room is getting very tired looking now and generally the hotel is in need of some modernisation. Hopefully this will happen soon. It would not stop us from staying there again but it does need doing. Our room was just beside the main road and the double glazing was useless. Wi Fi although we had free use is poor having to log in all the time. This could be improved quite easily.Breakfast has a reasonable selection although not massive.,The Landmark Nicosia

Their Buffet Breakfast is generous and versatile, the staff are all super friendly and helpful and the location is very central.They have an outdoor and indoor pool, which is an advantage.The hotel can use a few touch ups on a few areas, like the executive lounge upgrade.All in all it is probably the best hotel to stay in while in Nicosia...",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"I chose this hotel due to the Hilton Brand and just as importantly its proximity to my meeting location.Breakfast location, overlooking the pool and the service from the staff was great.The pool and surrounding area was spacious and had shady areas for those looking to escape the midday sun.It wasn't far from old Nicosia and should you find yourself in Cyprus but away from a beach- this is as good a hotel as you'll find there.Would definitely return there...",The Landmark Nicosia
50,The Hilton Cyprus delivers what you expect out of a Hilton and more - very comfortable rooms. Excellent meals in a beautiful poolside setting - with a view of the hills from the balconies. It is a short taxi ride away from the old centre of Nicosia where the life is - so to say. One little word of warning. Check on which network your mobile is roaming. If you have an EU sim card you will get a nasty surprise in your bill if your mobile roams on to the Turkish network which is easily accessible here due to the proximity of the border between north and south. Better to actively choose the network you are roaming on if you're staying in this hotel. There is also a convenient little grocery across the main street outside the hotel.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,It is really good hotel I have spent one night. With late checkout the service was extremely good and the room was well organized and clean the Corredor at the top floor need extra A/C near the elevators due to the skylight the service at the restaurant was very good also nice Gym and pool,The Landmark Nicosia

40,This is a well located hotel in Nicosia but disappointingly only had one restaurant available in the evening. Everything else was as expected but there are plenty of difficulties in parking during the day due to the number of people using that aren't staying at the hotel. The staff were very helpful.,The Landmark Nicosia

40,Staff is helpful. The rooms are clean and well appointed. The rates fair. The location couldn't be better as a meeting place and as a tourist looking to explore the city.My favorite part is the breakfast and just relaxing in the lounge with a drink. I definitely recommend.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Best hotel in Cyprus.Hands down this hotel offers the best on Cyprus. A good location, free parking, quality rooms, COLD air conditioning for those who want it, a good executive lounge, and great food and drink. I was blown away by the flawless customer service and customer care. Every member of staff went out of their way to provide great service and anticipated our every need. My family and I felt so welcome and happy. The pool and garden area is awesome and the food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner lovely and not expensive. very authentic Cypriot experience. Nicosia itself is also very cool and worth a visit!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"My first visit in Hilton Cyprus was excellent as expected! Staff were very polite and helpful, room was clean, spacious and quiet. I was offered a room with pool view with no extra cost. Breakfast was also very good with big selection buffet. A high quality hotel, I will definitely visit it again and suggest it to everybody.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The hotel lives up to the status of a Hilton hotel. Large lobby, restaurant and rooms.The staff is friendly and cordial. The rooms are large and spacious. The best part of the room that was given to me was it came with a medium sized balcony with a sit out which was really nice considering that the weather was awesome.The breakfast spread is awesome with wide variety of things to eat from choice of eggs to pastries.If one is interested and doesn't mind the walking, you can walk up to the old town (3kms) from the hotel. At the old town you do get a variety of shopping options from clothes to artefacts. You can also walk up to the Turkey Cyprus disputed border fence.Over all an excellent hotel to stay at.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We really liked this hotel. There is nothing significant to complain – rooms are spacious, nice furnished, clean, same bathrooms. Breakfast offer is very wide and staff is extremely polite. Hotel offers executive rooms and lounge with a nice evening snack. The only element to complain are short happy hours 5-7pm and staff keeps them very sharp.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I've stayed before in this hotel and this is my 2nd visit , my always comment was that hotel is OK , I mean nothing special ( as Business traveler) , but actually it is one of the most expensive Hotels i've stayed in . although i have a corporate rate , but without internet connection / Bkst , noway . I've tried thr resturant and the roome service the food is fine , like always fine but dosen't even close to the market prices of the same items",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"One night stay due to flight cancellation. The staff coped with 160 people arriving at 3 in the morning and for breakfast brilliantly. Didn't get chance to use much of the facility but room was very comfortable, and bathroom also.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Many parts of the hotel and staff were excellent, we have two nights R&R planned in Nicosia before flying back to the UK. The reception staff were very welcoming and provided us free wi-fi access, this was, I presume, to help with the disappointment of a room overlooking the car park. The room itself 631 was a pleasant twin room, clean and functional, we had no complaints.Quick change and down to the pool - the large sun umbrellas are heavy and challenging to put up, you can get help from the pool boy, but you need to walk up to him and ask, otherwise, like with us, he sat there and watched us struggle. We did notice however that he was much faster to spring into action when two young females merely glanced at there closed umbrella...next onto towels, they are provided, if you are male or a female over 30 you collect them yourself from the pool boys/ lifeguard area otherwise they will be brought to you by a smiling life guard. Next drinks - you have to be quick, if you spot the pool bar waiters wave something large and make some noise otherwise they circle the pool fast and keep there heads down. We managed to stop a young man in sun glasses and quickly apologised profusely for having the audacity to ask for a drink knowing full well he had more interesting things to do...at this stage we had no choice, the onset of dehydration had set in and we were close to death....Pool side eating - we ordered the hamburger, fries and coleslaw at 11 euros each, we didn't get the coleslaw and the hamburger was pretty dry, we was however charged 17 euros each, I questioned the bill and was politely told it was because my hamburger contained beef, confused and slightly still dehydrated I signed the bill...don't all hamburgers contain beef???We had a good nights sleep. The best part of our stay was the breakfast, it had an amazing choice of foods, and a great selection of drinks etc.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Stayed there for St. Valentines as they offered a great package! Upon arrival in room free strawberry-sweets and wine. The weekend was full of small surprises. Room hotel was spacious with very elegant furniture (executive), but bathroom was small - not the luxury bathroom you expect from 5 star. Breakfast and food was excellent. Free rose for ladies in St. Valentines, live music in dinner was very romantic. Wonderful piano in evenings in lobby - bar area! Staff was very polite and ready for any help. Minus was that they not have common steam bath, sauna and jacuzzi for couples. The hotel is aristocratic and brings some nostalgia from luxuriousness of the past. Would definitely go back",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Great hotel, fantastic staff, dated rooms though, haven't been decorated in 30 years! The general areas all very good, facilities excellent, must have been top class 30 years ago, come in Hilton, invest!! The staff are so worth it. Pool beautiful.

40,"Two three nights stays at the Hilton Cyprus over the last four weeks for business purposes. You always know what to expect from the hotel having stayed there on many occasions over the years. Facilities are very good including restaurants, bar, pool, fitness, wifi etc. What I would say though is that the hotel probably now needs an upgrade in a few areas - in-room entertainment system, fitness center. It's a very good hotel though and nothing much in Nicosia can match it.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"This is an excellent hotel, no question. Agreeable rooms. Good beds. Enough light. Quiet. Well-functioning central A/C. Nice bathrooms. Everything works. Friendly, helpful staff. Decent gym with a reasonable number of good machines with video screens. Fact remains, I booked it on account of its indoor swimming pool. This indoor swimming pool is very heavily trafficked. The hotel helpfully provides you with a timetable so you can see when there are no children's or adult classes scheduled in it. However, during these ""free swim"" hours, quite a few guests descend on the pool. Around four people can comfortably swim laps in this pool, and you might find more than four people trying to do that in a given ""free swim"" time. The water temperature is also rather warm (I'd guess around 84 degrees F), but that's to be expected in a hotel pool. All in all I liked my stay of 5 nights and would stay there again.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Recently stayed here as a couple (leisure weekend stay).We both are HHonors Diamond members so we are used to staying in Hilton hotels and we both agreed that this was definitely one of the better European Hiltons that we have visited.From the warm welcome at the reception (by George) to the good service during breakfast and in the executive lounge, we truly enjoyed our stay a lot!We were upgraded to a spacious junior suite on the executive floor and despite the 'classical style' (we usually prefer a more contemporary style, being young people) we liked our room a lot and the bed was big and comfortable. Our bathroom was large and had a separate shower stall (not all rooms have this). AC worked 'ok'.The rest of the hotel is also designed in a similar style but it looks very classy and in a way it works... no complaints at all! Everything is also very well kept and clean.I loved the fact that they seem to have many 'senior' staff members that clearly knew what they were doing, all very professional, obviously with many years of experience! Wow!!Outside swimming pool (they also have an indoor heated pool) was nice and refreshing and very clean and well kept. Nice staff as well. The large, well kept garden gave it a feeling of space as you were allowed to place your sun beds under the trees for shade.Breakfast was a true 5* experience with -again- wonderful staff members that were eager to please. The foods on offer were very good quality (but the choice wasn't as large as at the Hilton Park Nicosia...). The ability to eat outside (terrace overlooking the pool) added to the experience. Loved it!We had a rental car and the large parking lot had many (free) parking places. The distance to the old town was larger than expected but this wasn't a problem for us at all.Wifi was pretty fast and reliable.The executive lounge was without staff most of the day (many executive lounges are) but in the evening there was a very friendly guy (sorry I forgot his name) that made sure that we always had a full glass and he liked a little chat :-)) The food on offer seemed decent enough (we only had a small taste because we prefer dinner in town in the evenings). The lounge looked a bit 'old fashion' but was comfortable enough with plenty of seating everywhere (pity there was no outside terrace though).The Hilton Cyprus definitely left (only) good memories in our mind and we hope we can stay there again one day. Very much recommended and thanks again!!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,I really like staying here. The hotel is really nice in terms of facilities - great shops in the reception 'mall'. But the staff are what makes the place really stand out. I have always found Cypriot people to be very friendly but the hotel staff are truly superb! Definitely recommend.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed here for 5 nights for a conference nearby and was extremely comfortable. The staff are excellent, the place is immaculate, and we had a very good price as part of the conference package. The beds are very comfortable, but make it clear if you don't want twin beds and would prefer a king setup. The breakfast buffet was sensational, honestly, I didn't need to eat until dinner time most days, and the food quality is very high.If you are a tourist, this might be a little out of the way for you, but if you have a hire car everything in Cyprus is easy to get to anyway.Very happy.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Wonderful conference hotel, we were here for a conference at University of Cyprus, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel,very comfortable, excellent service, especially housekeeping staff, very helpful, good location and fabulous buffet breakfast - all kinds of fruit, breads, pastries very good all around",The Landmark Nicosia
40,The staff are exceptional - brilliant service.At reception in the exec lounge at breakfast - really friendly and efficient - this is what makes this a great hotelDecor is however dated. Housekeeping great but it feels like going back 20 years ..... Not quite sure how to describe the style but a bit hacienda a bit colonial ..... Grounds also a bit tatty and the pool area plagued by techno music from the bar ....It's the best hotel in Nicosia - and may make you nostalgic for a different time !!,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We stayed at the Hilton Cyprus for 6 nights mid May 16 for a relaxing break and warm weather.The hotel is centrally located with a nice pool and all the amenities you'd expect but with the addition of a lovely habano cigar shop in the lobby area.It is true that the hotel is getting on in years but it's the staff that make this hotel one we'd visit again.Having stayed at many hotels throughout the world we can say the staff here are genuinely concerned about the guests welfare, smiles and greetings genuine.We would like to thank Maria's team (front office) especially Alexia who looked after us.There were also the restaurant team who we met throughout the week from breakfast through to the executive lounge and dinner staff. All were a pleasure to be around.We spoke in detail with a few staff members who'd been at the hotel in excess of 10 years and it was this commitment from them that gave the family atmosphere that so many hotels lack.Many thanks to ALL the staff at the Hilton Cyprus.Alson",The Landmark Nicosia

Everybody constantly has a smile for you and nothing is too much trouble.,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Old fashioned hotel, good wifi, yet at extra charge, restaurant and wine list not impressive, definitely not for the price. Friendly staff but it all looks and feels a bit outdated. For the price it is a bit too much. Quite noice outside and next to a petrol station is not what you expect from Hilton",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Simply beautiful - the hall, the restaurants, the rooms, the pool. It is a great and very Hilton like facility. My second favourite after the Cavalieri in Rome as I find it charmingly elegant as much as the one in Rome. The Conrad in Dubai is now third on my list.This facility is great, service is exquisite at all levels - check-in, concierge, restaurants, room service. It is good for business purposes as well as for private trips to Cyprus as the city center is very nearby - either a quick cab ride or a nice and pleasant 20 minute walk.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Even before my arrival there was a high level of service extended to me, a multi-lingual tour guide and driver arranged with the concierge making many overseas to set this up in advance of me checking in.

Simply first class",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"This hotel ticks all the boxes as any other good old reliable Hilton hotel - well appointed rooms, excellent service with genuine warmth and great breakfast.The outdoor swimming pool was large, refreshingly cold and very clean. The gym is good for a hotel gym, however the machines are a bit old and it doesn't really make the grade as a health club proper.A slight let down was the traffic noise intruding into the room - despite the double glazed sliding balcony doors. If you're a light sleeper best to ask for a room facing the pool.The executive lounge offers a selection of cold and warm snacks between 5and 7pm, which is great. However precisely at 7pm, without warning everything is speedily withdrawn with very un-Cypriot military efficiency. This rather miserly attitude jars with the wider service standards in the hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia

In the afternoon they do a 'Business Lunch' for 24 euro, buffet style eat as much as you can which is fine if a little pricy. Interestingly a pint of the draft ale is the same price as a bottle of sparkling water at 8 euros.Never ate here in the evening, across the road there is place, Evohia restaurant, where you can eat as much as you like in the evening for 12 euros and 3 euros a draft pint and it's not bad at all.You get free WIFI if part of the Hilton Honours club otherwise you pay for it.Although this was April it was very warm and the air con was not responding to the controls, I suspect it was being centrally managed, this was the only real negative, everything else I knew about.",The Landmark Nicosia

The food is good in general (although you might want to skip the pizza).The hotel could benefit from a makeover because the rooms do look like they haven't changed since the 70's.Sadly the pool and pool bar were closed and considering the weather in Cyprus in April, I believe it should be opened. However I will go back for sure.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I visited the area for 3 Nights and opted for the Hilton, having stayed at many of their brands over the years and have come to expect a certain level of facilities and service, this meets all that.Staff I found to be attentive and helpful throughout my stay.The Building in itself is smaller than many of the Hilton's I have previously stayed in and could do with some level of investment in terms of refurbishment to bring it up to date and make it the number 1 Destination in Nicosia.Good location and the town within walking distance, for those wanting to travel a bit further the hotel were able to arrange a hire car for me.As some other reviews have touched on, many of the guests seemed to be here on business or using conference facilities.Breakfast was continental style with local delicacies available which is always nice to see.Would recommend",The Landmark Nicosia

The staff were friendly, helpful and very accommodating to our young children.The pool facilities are fantastic and it was great to have use of the tennis courts.Breakfast was excellent, with a wide choice. The 6th Floor executive lounge was also a great facility.When we arrived our room was perfectly made up for four. It was spacious very clean, well equipped and tastefully decorated. So why might you ask why have I only given it a 4/5? Well this is a real bugbear of mine. On subsequent days the room was made up for more often 2 or people for towels etc. Do they think children don't wash? It's such a pain phoning for more and it still not been right.If your looking for boutique, this is not for you. But if you want very good service and a comfortable hotel with lots of grounds within 20 min walk if the old town this is for you.It was good enough for FC Spartak Moscow who stayed at the same time!",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"This is clearly the place to stay in Nicosia, but frankly it's very overpriced given how tired the rooms and general feel of the place is. A particular weakness is the bathrooms (shower is a stand-up in the bath; you expect a proper shower at €250/night). Staff are perfectly pleasant, Wi-Fi is good, gym has loads of treadmills, but other than this it is hard to find much positive to say about this property given the price they are asking.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I have stayed on business many times over the years and the Hilton has retained its standards. Easy, convenient place to do business while in the capital yet it exudes a non-stuffy atmosphere.

Calm, relaxed and well-managed.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,This is a landmark hotel in Lefkosia. It used to be THE place when it opened but its age shows both outside and inside. It is is need of refurbishment to bring it in line with 21st century standards. I suppose the fact that Nicosia has business tourism only does not help.,The Landmark Nicosia

40,"Back in Cyprus to speak at a conference, we booked into this famous Hilton. Large and somewhat bulky building, the Nicosia Hilton is used extensively for business and and official meetings. The decor is somewhat flashy and the atmosphere a bit stuffy. The building rambles but is well appointed with facilities and resources to while away the hours. Therooms were wonderful, comfortable and cozy. Service was efficient and amazingly helpful, almost intuitive. The Executive Floor lounge was really good and relaxing with superb service from the receptionist. The big disappointment was the food - both service and quality. A group of 8, we ordered lunch only to wait an average of 45 minutes to be served. Although we all ordered at the same time, the various meals were brought two at a time. Orders were mixed up and the quality was at best mediocre. The prices were simply extortionate. No apologies offered, despite complaints. A chicken wrap with fries for €20 was excessive. Apart from that, the hotel staff (especially Reception) were outstanding.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"The Hilton Cyprus is definitely very comfortable. The rooms and related amenities are nice. The buffet breakfast was always excellent, for each of my four days. The bar, however, is poor. It is very slow and not all menu items are available. The meal I ordered from room service was well presented but did not taste great. Overall, for the price and 5* status, I wasn't all that impressed (except the breakfast, which was always very nice). But I wasn't unhappy either.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,I always stay at Hilton Cyprus during my regular business trips. The rooms are very nice and spacious. The staff are very welcoming and hospitable. They ask us daily about our stay and take our comments very seriously. The breakfast is also very nice. My comment would just be to include more varieties to the in-room dining (ex. Halal food). I would like to thank all the staff members and especially Yiannos the Bell Boy who is very helpful and caring.,The Landmark Nicosia

30,"I stayed in Hilton, Nicosia on New Years eve. Although we are local Nicosians me and my boyfriend decided to do something different and since we were to be out we got an executive room full board with breakfast. I have lived here most of my life and i pass by the Hotel every day. I have been to it's pool, to the wonderful cafe inside and have had wedding receptions. So my hopes were high. However, the room was very average, the color system was bland and it looked like a business man's business trip room. One thing i was highly dissatisfied was the fact that there was a wireless charge inside the room for 10 euros however the wifi downstairs at the cafe was free. For a 5 star hotel this could not be overlooked. Also there were some water bottles/snacks above the mini bar which looked as though they were complementary (as i had to use water to make tea with the free tea packets) and when we called reception they said those were charged too. We were also told that we were given a wonderful room but the view was the main street and the noise was loud. The pillows were not comfortable so it wasn't the best of sleep.Two good things worth mentioning however - 1. they surprised us with a small dish of very microscopic desserts (as it was NYE) and 2. the Breakfast buffet is great and the service is great too - ALTHOUGH it is very expensive for someone not staying at the hotel to go for just breakfast. If you need a regular room and you are not expecting much out of your stay, this is where you should go.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"I have stayed at this hotel several times over the years. The facilities are good, the beds comfortable, the outside swimming pool is a joy and the breakfasts are very substantial. But what marks out a really good hotel is how it responds to a guest's crisis. I left in a hurry and left my phone in my room. At the airport I contacted reception after I had found a public phone I could use. They sent someone up to the room immediately and retrieved it. This took the panic out of the situation. The next day the head of housekeeping contacted me and asked how I would like it to be sent to England and outlined the options. Two days after my return it was brought to my front door and life could return to normal. Now that is what I call service!",The Landmark Nicosia

The staff had heard of our ordeal and were really kind and helpful. I would love to have a planned stay at the Hilton next time we are in Cyprus.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed here for one night on business and couldn't complain about anything - as you'd expect from a Hilton, really nice room, everything felt like it was of high quality and the staff could not be faulted in any way for helpfulness and friendliness. Was left just slightly underwhelmed by the dinner menu - pretty much zero local food - and the bar, which was no more than a hotel lounge. In addition, although it was exceptionally handy for my meetings, it is not what you'd call central, being about a mile from the centre of Nicosia.One other thing, wifi is charged as extra in the room but not in the public areas, somewhat bizarrely. Having stayed in plenty of places around the world where wifi is simply free to guests, I regard this as a bit of a fleece.Would stay here again but plan better to make sure I got out for the evening.",The Landmark Nicosia

There is a taxi spot right outside the hotel which is very convenient. High standards for serving customers but some services are really overpriced!

The check in process was quick and efficient and all the staff were friendly.In this day and age having free Wi-Fi in the lobby but having to pay €10 to use it in one’s room is not good for a 5-star hotel which is pricey in the first place. After mentioning this to reception they informed me that if I was a Hilton member and booked using the hotels website then this would have been free.Breakfast was included in my room rate and was a buffet comprising of pretty-much everything one could imagine.My room was on the top, 7th floor.

Breakfast is very good, many choices, amazing cheeses and pastries and chef comes every morning with new stuff. The fitness area is not huge but workable. Beware at the air conditioning though.

Housekeeping was very friendly and I was asked on more than one occasion if there was anything which could be done to make my stay even better.

Elena the front desk manager and Maria the head receptionist make sure your stay is perfect in every aspect even when the hotel is busy, whilst the restaurant staff and chefs deliver fantastic meals including free ""chefs specials"". The Executive lounge is very quiet and well serviced, it only provides non alcoholic beverages during the day but in the evening you can have a very wide range of free food including soup, pasta, hot snacks and sandwiches as well as wines and beers. The staff even circulate with a tray of delicious sweets to round off the relaxing evenings. I travel extensively and cannot understand any of the negative comments posted about this hotel - it is at the top of my list for a return visit.

Bathroom is again a little old, and was a little let down, but it suffices.Service was an absolute pleasure, and all staff were highly professional and very courteous.The executive lounge is nicely decorated.

But, just over the road is a bar and restaurant called Evohia, and for 11.90 Euros you can eat as much as you like and for the money you are paying it is not bad at all. A pint of Keo is 3 Euros. There is also a small supermarket near it as well if you wanted fresh fruit.A sarnie in the hotel will cost between 13 and 20 Euros, rip off.When we were there it was when the dust cloud appeared. One really bad day and the next day you could see clear blue sky but....they still kept the pool shut, we could not get an answer as to why, nanny state maybe.

50,"These summer after staying in Hilton hotels in New York city, London and elsewhere I have concluded that this hotel is the best! And there are many reasons for that. Every guest arriving to the venue is treated in a best way possible. Rooms are different but mostly good. Each room has got even nicer view than others. In dusty Nicosia I think every grain of dust just scares to cross the hotels borders. And this is because of Executive Housekeeper Maria. She is just wonderful and cares about every guest. Other 2 ladies at Front Office are icons of professionalism and local customs. With their hey and welcome they beautify the entrance of the venue better than any bouquet. Other Front office staff is attentive to every need and always ready to assist.Yesterday I witnessed how the front office staff have managed very large group arrival. It was remarkable indeed. I stay here couple time a month and can assess the level of service from different stand points. Food quality is very good, and together with the service element is making perfect touch to every taste.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Nice hotel although do agree with previous reviewers that perhaps a bit dated. Stayed for a week as husband on a business trip. Set up good for business customers but lacking as far as activities for the holiday maker and too far away from the centre of Nicosia to easily travel there without transport. Room very comfortable. General air of money with goods in shops in foyer costing more than we could afford, nice to look at though.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,Hotel is a bit dated but clean and comfortable. Wifi could do with a boost due to poor connection even on the paid wifi. Staff are very helpful and attentive. Bar is very expensive compared to outside prices. Good selection of food available at breakfast.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,The hotel provides everything that you could need on a trip to the capital of Cyprus. All members of staff were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The pool is large and clean and there are lots of loungers. Towels are provided. Large range of choice at breakfast with lots of fresh fruit and healthy options.20 minute walk to the old town or a taxi costs 7 euros.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Everything was perfect . The room ,staff ,Location,Service.The staff was very friendly. Breakfast was excellent and had big variety of foods. Value for money this Hotel 100% .i will stay again next time .",The Landmark Nicosia
30,Room was clean and old fashionedThe bed was very very comfatableThe bathroom was very dissapointing dont get me wrong it was very clean with all the added complimentary items you would expect but just seemed lacking for a hotel that is a 5 star expected alot moreYou have to be rich to use the mini bar i mean 5 euros for a kitkat get a gripBreakfast was standardStaff were very niceWouldnt pay the asking priceThe view from the room was awfull see added pics,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Hotel is located 15 min walk from the old town of Nicosia. Nice rooms, but nothing extra-ordinary. Even executive rooms do not match up Exec rooms in other European capitals. However, staff is exceptional, nice and friendly.Free wifi with Hhonors.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Lovely hotel. Room spacious and clean and a pleasant outdoor pool area that will provide you with towels. Staff friendly and helpful. Only managed to get to breakfast once and the food was the usual thing you find in a hotel of this kind. Short taxi journey to the town that only costs a few euros. Would definitely recommend staying here.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,I stayed there for three days on business last week and everything was on par with Hilton standards. George Anastasiou and Rolandos Antopoulos at the front desk were particularly amazing sparing no effort to help us and make our stay perfect.,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"The hotel was very easy to find. Upon arrival the staff were very helpful although they did not advise us of the restrictions of the use of the executive lounge ie with regards to the happy hour for alcohol which is between 5-7. The food at the pool was lovely couldnt fault it.My only major disappoinment with this hotel was the works being carried out to remove the patio doors of the rooms facing the pool. The noise was unreal with the drills they were using, it was dusty and not relaxing at all! I think Hilton should advise on their website before booking that work is being carried out as I would have not stayed here, I would have stayed at the other Hilton hotel in Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"My husband and I stayed here a couple of nights while we were in Nicosia for a Christening. The room and facilities were great and the staff offer by far the best service I have ever experienced at a hotel. It felt like no issue was too small for them to help with. They even quickly tracked down a dozen little safety pins for me to sort out one of my dresses.Maria at Reception and Maria Head of Housekeeping made a special effort to check we were happy with everything during our stay. And every other staff member we encountered always greeted us with a warm smile and made us feel very welcome.If you need a place to stay in Nicosia, I doubt you will find anywhere better. Do be warned though, once you have been spoilt by the service here, your stay at other hotels may pale in comparison!",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed more that five times at Hilton Cyprus due to business travels.Staff is very polite and helpful what you would expect from such a hotel. Breakfast is great, food at the restaurant is great. Rooms are typical hotel rooms, clean with all the amenities expected. Biggest problem in Hilton Cyprus is that the WiFi is only offered at the lobby/bar for free and it has some ridiculous prices to use it in the room. Hilton Cyprus must reconsider their strategy in this since we live in an era where not only the business travelers need FREE WiFi internet access but also everyone with a smartphone uses it.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,We found the Hilton an excellent place to stay for our visit to Nicosia. Once you have got over the usual drawback of a Hilton in a capital city - the cabin crew holding court - it becomes clear that the hotel is particularly well run with helpful reception staff and good facilities. Breakfast was excellent. It proved a good base for visiting the eastern parts of the Troodos mountains.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,Sure it is luxurious but the suites need a renovation. . Ugly curtains and bed covers! The breakfast and meals are amazing. The beds are super comfortable. . Not too expensive either. Ideal for wedding receptions,The Landmark Nicosia
40,This was my second stay this year and the staff are very attentive and friendly. We had an executive room on the 6th floor which was a good size and excellent wardrobe space and plenty of electrical sockets. ( Many of the hotels we have stayed in recently have had very few sockets!) The hotel has a nice pool but the gym facilities do need to be modernised. We did appreciate the lounge facilities in the early evening for one night. Snacks and drinks are very good. I would stay again.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I arrived at the Hilton in a some kind of desperate situation as my airline lost my luggae on the transfer in Munich. But the Hilton FrontDesk and staff did a wonderful job in covering up for the airline's screw up and were even able to get me a rental suite on a Sunday late afternoon for my meetings to take place the next day.I am stillw ondering how they did that and still highly appreciative of their engagements for their guest.I had some dinner on the first evening at the pool bar which was great to eat, but wiht my mindset and lost luggage in the backmind, I wasn't able to finish the meals. THis definitely is not related to the high quality food they server to their guests.Check-In/ Check-Out was super friendly and warmly hearted and all the staff I was in contact with was super helpful and really gave their aboslute best to let me feel home at the Hilton.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Thanks to Thomas Cook, we stayed here on 21st August 2015, having had our flight cancelled.Check in was quick and efficient. For a family of four, we were given two connecting rooms.Considering that they had 300+ people dropped on them at short notice, we were presented with a good quality evening meal followed by breakfast and lunch the following day.The rooms are of a good standard with comfortable beds, a well equipped bathroom, although toothpaste would have been handy and a well stocked mini bar. However, prices deterred me from using this facility.The ground floor has some interesting little boutique style shops to explore as well as some glass elevators, providing you don't mind heights.The outside pool is a great size and well equipped with plenty of sun beds. There is a facility to get towels, which is really handy. The poolside bar offered a great range of refreshments but with beer or soft drinks starting around €5 and a sandwich starting around €14, we again declined. However, it's fair to say that if, unlike us, you were planning a stay at the Hilton then you probably have an expectation around the associated prices.Finally, considering everything that occurred in our 24 hour stay, the staff were most helpful, pleasant and accommodating.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I have been staying at the Hilton in Nicosia, Cyprus on and off during visits for over a year. It is a wonderful experience with the best breakfast I have ever come across as a regular business traveller for more than 30 years.The hotel is centrally located and has good amenities and a large outdoor pool. It is a centre for social life in Nicosia, which helps to provide interest and involvement with its locally community. The room are good and the beds are great.But it is the performance of employees of the hotel that really stands out. Unlike many other hotels at which I have stayed, the staff at the Hilton Cyprus are local people who take genuine interest in the experience of guests. They are keen to present a very favourable impression of their town and country. Many have become friends and share their personal news and views as eagerly as I share mine. They are flexible in providing answers to enquiries and solutions to problems. They made me feel welcome and at home.First class experience, especially for a long stay.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,overnight stay here due to a flight cancellation. The speed which the staff got everyone to their rooms was fantastic. The food and drink offered was of a high standard. The restaurant staff friendly and welcoming.The rooms are of a high standard as expected with large comfy beds the usual toiletries (could do with toothpaste) mini bar expensive but not a surprise.The pool area and gardens were very pleasant with a lifeguard on duty. A selection of shops within the lobby area and a relaxing bar.A very big thank you to all the staff on duty who made our unexpected stop a pleasure.,The Landmark Nicosia
20,"Do not stay in this hotel because.............I recently stayed at this Hilton for 5 nights. I was given a nice room overlooking the pool, like I paid for, and all was good for about 3 hours. Once the person in the next room over started smoking inside the room it made it impossible to breath in both my room and the hallway. I know for sure that it was the person in the next room because I could smell the smoke coming out from under the door. This person was not using the balcony to smoke like the hotel allows, they were in the room. This is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel.Well I called the front desk and they said thanks for notifying us and did absolutely nothing for 2 more hours. Once I could no longer take it I went to the front desk told the person on duty. I got a blank stare in response. I suggested a room change and was given a new room but it seemed that my request was not well received.Once in my new room I thought everything would be fine again. Problem one started with an air conditioner that would not cool the room down below 24-25 degrees. It was a hot night sleeping. Front desk was called and I though while I was down getting breakfast I would tell the desk agent. Absolutely nothing was done about this. Night two was again hot for sleeping.The next morning I woke up and went down to breakfast. When I was done I went back up to the room to find a huge puddle on the floor and wall with water running down it. The AC unit was now leaking all over the walls, floor and had gotten some of my personal items wet. I received nothing more than an apology card and some fruit. Like I couldn't get that in the lobby.That same night I was getting ready for bed and noticed that the toilet was actually leaking from the incoming water connection (not grey water, but clean water) and based on the late hour (23:00) I decided it could wait for morning since it was not pouring out.In the morning the floor was mostly dry but I could still see water slowly dripping from the water line. I flushed the toilet and water came out at a higher rate. It seemed to be a problem when the toilet was flushed. I again notified guest services on the phone and told the person at the front desk. I then left for the day. Upon my return I found the floor was mopped clean but the leak remained. I was so frustrated I gave up and didn't call anyone.I checked out at 3AM the next morning.The things the hotel did well were limited but they are friendly, the restaurant staff was great and the food was good albeit overpriced.Last comment is about non-hotel guests in the lobby. There were people in the lobby area all day that were not staying in the hotel. They were using the hotel for the lobby, free coffee, free WiFi and air conditioning. I know they were not guests because I heard them say so a few times. This was unacceptable as they were taking up seats and standing blocking the entrance/exit numerous times during my ins and outs.If business brings me back to Nicosia I will not stay in this hotel and will not recommend my colleagues stay here either.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Arriving in the early hours, staff were plentiful and welcoming. The room a delight, with heavenly beds and the usual Hilton accessories. Mini bar overpriced but that's to be expected.Breakfast is a true delight, many wonderful choices and very tasty.

50,"We stayed at the Cyprus Hilton for six days when we travelled to the Island to attend a wedding. Before we stayed at the Hotel we were in contact to ensure a parcel had arrived that we had sent by post. Everything possible to make our stay relaxed and enjoyable was put our way. We stayed in a room overlooking the pool and this was more than adequate. The bed/beds were super comfortable, consisting or two doubles together. All of the facilities were staffed by friendly individuals and we would have to mention George on the front desk and Fortini at the dining room as outstanding.Whilst the parcel never arrived at the Holtel (it had to be picked up by me from the local post office) the Hotel staff made all the enquiries and bent over backwards to assist. Thank you all for making our stay most enjoyable.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"This is the top business hotel in Nicosia. It's a long walk into the city center and the taxis are expensive in Cyprus. Use a hire care but, be warned, the car parking at this hotel can be a nightmare, especially when there is a conference, exhibition or wedding.The hotel is in two parts. The original building houses the standard rooms. The in room Hi Fi is free if you are a Hilton Honors member and book the room on the Hilton website.The 'Executive Wing' was a later addition and has the Executive Lounge on the 7th Floor. This hotel can be very expensive at certain times of the year but, is usually empty and cheap in August.There is a great outdoor pool and the leisure facilities in the basement of the Executive Wing has an indoor pool.The breakfast room has indoor and outdoor seating in the Summer months. The breakfast is superb and the standard of service excellent. There are no international newspapers available in the restaurant, only Greek.The Fontana restaurant does an excellent buffet at lunch and dinner and, also has frequent food events. They regularly give a voucher on arrival for bonus points to your Hilton Honors account when using the Fontana restaurant.The Executive lounge is large and comfortable but the computer facilities are limited. The evening buffet is always excellent but, along with a small number of other Hilton's, have now restricted the 'Happy Hour' service to beer & wine - in this case locally brewed Carlsberg & Le Piat D'Or - forget a vodka tonic or whisky on the rocks. There is no FT, NYT or local English language newspapers - only Greek.The staff are excellent and the standard of Housekeeping is high. The reception team are welcoming and have good concierge support.If you are doing business in Nicosia, this is the place to stay.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I had one of the best experience at Hilton Cyprus. I was assisted by George A. at front desk, he responded to my inquiries promptly, better, he offered me a 2 pm late check out when he learned I planned on going to N.

Very very friendly.Dinos, Rami and Panayotis at the lobby restaurant/pool-side restaurant. They really really went the extra mile when I decided to do takeaway. Dinos even offered me a bottle of water.I really had one of the best experiences here. Highly recommended.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"This hotel is very nice, not stunning and suffers from having to apply Hilton corporate policies. For example, why was I given little paper vouchers in order to get the Hilton Honours rate for breakfast? It's 2015! This could easily be dealt with via the central system. Similarly the Internet access is free for HH members yet when you log on you are presented with a menu of prices for Internet access. The cost is disapplied later ( although as I queried it I am not sure if the disappliaction is automatic or not). The room was clean, if a little boring. What I really didn't like though was that I could hear every word said in the room next door ( including the other person on a telephone call) so the walls are obviously very thin. I had a very good room service meal ( mushroom risotto and fruit) which was above average fro room service. The breakfast was fairly standard international hotel fare. I didn't use the pool but it looked very nice.",The Landmark Nicosia

Weather in the dinning hall, the bar, the lobby, the reception, the beautiful pool or the lounge, the staff at all levels including management are always attentive to the various needs of the guests.I never hesitate to recommend this excellent hotel to anyone who is on business or leisure.",The Landmark Nicosia
20,"For a Hilton hotel I felt one this was extremely over priced for the location ... All the majority of staff seemed to be trained in the art of upselling!! ... The bar prices were extortionate to say the least ,, 25 euro for a Hendricks gin works out in English terms 1000 euro per bottle !!! How do they get to these prices .. Charges for using wifi in an overpriced room is also made !!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"It never fails to amaze me with the efficiency of the staff from the minute I arrive. The running of this hotel and the professionalism from the Bell desk on arrival, the check-in experience and even on departure, is always of the same very high standard. If you are visiting Nicosia on business or pleasure, alone or with family, then it will be difficult to find a better place to stay. My special thanks to the Bell Captain on duty when I arrived at 5pm on the 1st July. With the visit of the Cyprus President, there was a very full car park as usual. He delicately handled the police who wanted my car park space for their own car and sorted the situation in a very professional manner.",The Landmark Nicosia

We stayed here after our British Airways flight was delayed for 24hrs and unlike the previous reviewer (possibly had too many of those beers), we found the staff here absolutely fantastic and nothing was too much trouble. Stelios the Restaurant Manager was very attentive to make sure we had everything we wanted and the food was delicious with lots of variety to suit everyone. Yes, you were given one drink but as this was all being paid for by B.A then we found this not a problem and there was a shop just opposite if you didn't want to pay the usual hotel prices.The facilities were excellent with a lovely outdoor pool to make use of in the heat of the capital.",The Landmark Nicosia

Particularly if you like your coffee, you should be prepared to pay 5 euros for an espresso and 14 for a capuccino. Cant understand how these prices can be: a) justifiable and b) sustainable in the long term",The Landmark Nicosia
10,"Last night my flight got cancelled due to an engine issue. The airline quickly arranged coaches and a hotel and got us there within a couple of hours.Tired, frustrated and in a daze we were give our room keys at 00:00. My co-worker and I wanted to have a couple of drinks in the hotel bar before, when we went to the bar we were met by an extremely grumpy lady who pretty much slammed our drinks down and gave us one word responses. She had a massive attribute and was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. The beer was also €6 for a tiny bottle.We then heard from other guests that there was free food and drink in the dinning room (the hotel staff neglected to tell us this and let us pay for drinks at the bar) when we finally found the dinning room we were met by more really grumpy staff, who were very abrupt. We took a couple of beers and some food, no one else was around really, I expect most people went to bed. When we asked for another drink we got barked at saying only 1 each.After this I left and went to bed, woke up the next day with a load of bites, I took a shower. The towels stunk of BO, they smelled unwashed and like they have been there for weeks.Breakfast wasn't any better, more grumpy staff and bad food which looked and tasted barely edible, I would have passed if I had somewhere else to go. Then I wanted to get some water, I asked at the bar, they said it would cost me €3 for one small bottle of water.All in all I did not stay here by choice and I did not pay to be here either, just because I am not a paying customer does not mean that I should find this externally hostile environment acceptable. The airline have paid for us and I expect this hotel is making a lot of money out of this situation. The staff do seem friendly with the locals but I haven't yet had a single smile from anyone.The bad food and expensive drinks and even the smelly towel I could probably live with. But there is clearly a problem here with staff, they seem very unhappy and very reluctant to be polite to us, they are rude and I feel extremely unwelcome, I can not wait to leave this place and never come back.Thom",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"The Only 5-star hotel in Nicosia and the Best Choice!I instantly felt the new changes and the upgrading of services from the moment I walked in. Being at the Cyprus Hilton is like being at home –without the pressure, the responsibility or the obligations. And as I mostly travel unaccompanied, I can come here on my own but never feel alone. I find it unique in Cyprus –a hub of business and pleasure activities and the capital’s premier meeting place.It is not just a superb hotel, but one of the 25 Hilton worldwide properties recognized and awarded at World Travel Awards in Europe 2014.LOCATION: As a hotel geared predominantly to business clientele, the location makes it the ideal point with only a 15 minute walk to the shopping streets and cultural sites of the city center.CHECK-IN: Being a repeater it is like walking home. Maria whom I know for years, was behind the reception this time and the welcome was warm and friendly as always. Check-in was swift and efficient, just a signature and my luggage was directly taken up to the room. I was escorted to the lobby lounge for a drink and had a friendly chat with a couple of staff members.STAFF/SERVICE: Once again, I experienced an unparalleled level of excellent service starting from the concierge, front desk, housekeeping, restaurant staff, SPA and management. Being professional, they know well how to spoil their guests and make them feel important and valued.True team spirit, trained and engrained from the top down. Across the hotel and within each department I noticed something in the air this time, more like a family feeling than a corporate culture.AMBIENCE: Classic elegance. The spacious and impressive Lounge and the Paddock bar send out a relaxing atmosphere. Moving on towards the executive wing, you cannot help but be impressed with the ostentatious lifts and the whole of that corner.Then there is the ground floor promenade with its owesome boutiques and the Hair and Beauty Salon. We usually believe that one has to be well-off to enter. This does not exist here it is a wrong impression. Spare a moment and check for yourselves. There are excellent bargains.JUNIOR SUITE: On this visit, I spent 4 amazing nights at the corner suite #472.The suite was huge and gorgeous, (67m²/721sq.ft) stylish and classy, with a king-sized bed and a separate seating area. The leading patio door windows opened to a small balcony that overlooked part of the back garden.With access to the Executive Lounge and with high-speed internet I was totally spoilt. Nothing was missing, an eloquent silence in an amazing ambience.BATHROOM: Spacious with a separate bathtub and a walk-in shower, an extensive mirror, a pot of flowers, robes and slippers, and the amazing Peter Thomas Roth set of toiletries. These products smell fresh tangerine and are way too refreshing. I simply love them.WI FI: Free in the communal (lobby, pool, bars).In-Room Internet Access is free only to the Hilton HH Honor Members. Be sure to check out for these benefits!Subscription for 24 hours is €15.00 and for 72 hours - €45.00.RESTAURANTS: Breakfast is taken at the Fontana and it is a delectable feast. There’s anything one can imagine, plus the option of healthy breakfast that appeals to guests with specific dietary preferences.FONTANA: Fabulous and pleasant ambience. With several awards in his record the Executive Chef de Cuisine Andreas Georgiou and his professional team of Chefs have taken the cuisine to another level. The menu is varied to suit all tastes. The buffet includes both traditional and international dishes, healthy and vegetarian options.SWIMMING POOL: The urban oasis of Nicosia!The outdoor swimming pool is the all-time favorite meeting place for both guests and locals who seek an oasis in the city center. I spent most of my time lazing out here this time enjoying the high quality service, comfortable sunbeds and pleasant ambience. I consider it the best choice for the warm summer days.FITNESS CENTRE & SPA: The Hiltonia Club is the most refined Health and Fitness Club of the city. It is extremely popular with locals and its members reach the 500 per year in winter while in summer it exceeds the 600. It offers a variety of sports classes for all ages. Guests can enjoy most of the facilities complimentary.The SPA is the perfect place to relax and forget your worries, whether you choose to indulge in a massage to release built-up tension, a facial to soothe sunburnt holiday skin, or an aromatherapy treatment to calm mind, body and spirit.From the long list of therapies I opted for the totally new Caviar treatment. The package includes an Eye, Neck and Decolette mask. It instantly gave the skin a brightening boost and rejuvenation. I highly recommend it.EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: A specially designed area, with exclusive access to residents of the Executive rooms and suites, fully equipped and provided with computers, TV, drinks and micro-meals to meet the needs of Hilton’s demanding guests.BUSINESS CENTRE: A fully equipped centre with 24 hour services. For guests’ convenience, computers, color printer, scanner and high-speed internet are provided, while the team is always at the disposal of guests for any help or information they may need.BEAUTY SALON: A visit to the hotel’s barber shop or beauty salon will help you look your best.HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CITY: I highly recommend the Archaeological Museum. Make it the #1 on your Visit List. It is way too significant and it should definitely not be missed.Take a stroll as far as Ledras and Laiki Geitonia. Perhaps step over the Green line and have a stroll by the other side too.A MEAL OUTSIDE: As a Food Critic, I always like to recommend one or two businesses. This time my choice is the humble vegetarian restaurant called “Inga’s Veggie Heaven”. (Look out for my review) Be sure to try the Raw Vegetable soup which is served cold and is way too refreshing, and definitely the Vegetable Burger called “Yummy”…because it really is.IN ALL: I cannot think of a single fault that failed to impress.The hotel manager and members of the management were highly visible, active members of the team which demonstrates an honest dedication to quality and service. So, if you want to pamper yourselves and experience all what I describe above, then this is the right place to be. A big ‘thank you’ goes to the entire team who contributed in making my stay once again one to remember.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Very expensive for what is on offer. It is obvious that once a competitor opens shop that prices will go down. It is unfortunate that people can't think ahead and take measures to avoid the inevitable. I guess time will tell. The breakfast is good though ! regards, Alix",The Landmark Nicosia
50,We stayed for 7 nights in the Hilton Cyprus in May 2014 and thought it was excellent all round and could not be beaten. We came back with our friends from 11th to 18th May 2015 and yes it was excellent but much better. The restaurant has a wonderful new menu from the previous year. We ate each night in the restaurant and we were astonished by the level of service and hospitality. The Staff are all very professional and just know how to make you welcome with that certain ease which only comes after much experience. You will not be disappointed at this hotel.We can't wait to return next year.,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"The Hilton Cyprus Hotel is an interesting venue in Nicosia. Situated in an ideal position for business and leisure within the center of Nicosia, it offers adequate accommodation for the modern traveler. The rooms are spacious, albeit aged. The hotel offers impressive public places, and the outdoor pool looks impressive. The indoor pool was too busy with children's swimming classes, which do not make it a welcome relaxing place to visit after a long day. The breakfast was tasty and the selection of fruits tasty. The rooms could benefit with a revamp and the pressure of the hot water was definitely too low...",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Nice rooms, great breakfast & meal! Nice for a quick business drink & also for business meetings. Very polite staff! Very comfortable bed & cosy atmosphere! Nevertheless, it's unacceptable that you have to pay extra for Internet in your room...",The Landmark Nicosia
40,Enjoyed our stay. We Would stay there again. And don't miss the breakfast! Prefect venue for a reception. The service was excellent. Location in relations to the airport is about 1/2 drive but close to downtown. Great pool area life guard duty.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I have a feeling that this hotel is the top offering in Nicosia and whilst the city itself may be a little rough around the edges, staying in the Hilton Cyprus goes a long way to make your stay here more pleasurable. I'm talking great common areas which are spacious, cool and well furnished. Wonderful food - fantastic breakfast buffet whether you like continental style or a full English and everything in between, you won't be disappointed. Service is very good. All staff speak English. Some of the staff can seem slightly 'uppity' to a Brit sensibility - let's say they can be quite direct. Eg if you arrive in the restaurant at 9.55am you may not receive a warm welcome by the staff who are planning to clear breakfast away at 10am sharp. Watch out for Fontini - she's super strick on breakfast timings! But really it's just for our own good, hahaha! The hotel is arranged around a very appealing swimming pool. The rooms are very comfortable indeed. Air con works quietly (bliss), bathrooms are immaculate. Good minibar choice and free tea/coffee making in the rooms. Our room had a small balcony with table and chairs. I think this is standard. There is a business room in reception with computers and printers for all your work needs (or printing out your boarding pass). Free wifi in the communal areas. You pay extra if you want it in your room (I think it is €15 per day). There are a number of shops in the lobby area including a useful little newsagents (British newspapers available) that also sells water and various basics you may need. Small niggle - as far as I could see the only papers provided by the hotel were local ones, no foreign ones. Back to food - you can do a great buffet at lunch time for €24 a head - 3 courses. Or go a la carte. Dinner's a la carte is very good quality. The staff are very helpful on reception and you can easily get a taxi at the front entrance, just press the little bell there and one comes very quickly. €6 fare to take you into the Old Town. €11 to get to the American Heart Centre hospital. €110 to go from the hotel to Paphos airport. There is an indoor pool and gym in the basement. My conclusion: if you have to be in Nicosia for some reason, business or perhaps visiting someone at the top notch American hospital, then this hotel will make you feel better about it. It's a city hotel which tries it's best and succeeds in giving you a feel good factor during your stay.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Even though it had been a while since I have stayed at the Hilton Nicosia, the staff remembered me and welcomed me back as if it was yesterday! Great attention to detail and efficient service from the front desk to the restaurant.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Best business hotel in Nicosia, rooms are good, there is plenty of choice at breakfast and the pool area is very nice if you get the chance for a swim between meetings, would recommend to anyone that travels to Nicosia on business.Another nice touch is that although I only visit once or twice a year, the reception and concierge staff always remembers you.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"hotel, room, breakfast, pools.... all classy. very nice.gym - exercise room can use an upgrade; also, gym and indoor pool are on the same level (underground) so you're basically breathing 'pool air' + sweating insanely while exercising. I would find a way to seal the pool doors.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"If you go on business make sure you join the business lounge. drinks, snacks on offer all day and wonderful for meetings or relax and use computers and printers.Rooms are just what you expect for 5 stars and the staff are the most helpful and polite people you could ever meet. The resturant, although expensive we found very good and the buffet excellent.The bar was very friendly and coffee lounges inside and out were great for food and of course drinks for more casual lunches and dinners.The only down side to the Hilton is Parking, so if you rent a car you might find it difficult trying to find a parking spot if you go out during the day or evening you'll find cars parked every where, illegal or not, but the staff will always sort the problem out for you",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This was such a fabulous experience. The quality of this hotel is superb and I would not hesitate to stay again. All staff were courteous, kind, polite and welcoming and the food is fantastic.

The internet was free as I am a Hilton member.The front desk staff were so helpful as they gave me a complimentary late check out until 6 PM.I would definitely come back to the same hotel",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I chose this hotel because of its convenient location for a business trip. The premises are very good and the service exceptional. the staff is very polite, making sure that everything is ok. My room was big, the bed was comfortable, there was iron and iron board, complimentary tea and coffee facilities. The breakfast had plenty of choices and the cappuccino that i ordered was great. There was a charge for the Internet (but for the Hilton members.I will definitely come again.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights in April 2015 as a family of four. The service from start to finish was amazing, and as a hilton diamond member having stayed at over 50 hilton properties it was the best service I have received at any Hilton (and that includes the Waldorf Cavalieri Imperial Floor in Rome).On arrival we were welcomed as if we were VIPs and upgraded to room 669 which is a lovely suite with a huge lounge on the executive floor.The room was well appointed with comfortable bed, TVs etc and housekeeping was first class and compared very well to Cypriot hotels.The executive lounge was nicely laid out with drinks etc during the day and a selection of complimentary food in the evening including sandwiches, desserts, pastas, crisps etc (and beer and wine). Staff were efficient, friendly and excellent.Breakfast was excellent with a superb hot and cold buffet plus food cooked to order such as pancakes. Again the service was fabulous. A nice touch was that one of the chefs would bring out to each table a Cyprus Delicacy for you to try.The outdoor pool was unfortunately closed but there is an indoor pool which is nice if a bit crowded and noisy sometimes due to it being used frequently for swimming lessons. The hotel has a great gym with cardio machines and weights etc.The hotel foyer is nice and has designer shops etc on the ground floor.The hotel is easy to find as it is on the main road entering Nicosia and is about a 1 mile walk to the shopping district (although parking in the city is available)Thank you Hilton Cyprus for making this a lovely stay. We will definitely return to this super hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"We stayed there for 3 nights and I have to say that it was a pleasant stay. The hotel was generally ok, but definately was not a 5 star one. Our room was clean and spacious. Not so pleased with the toiletries though. Moreover there is a charge of 4 euros/hour for using the WiFi inside the room. WiFi is free in the lounge instead. Breakfast had a good variety of delicacies while the Chef served us after request crepes straight from his kitchen.The stuff were absolutely kind and helpful. We won't forget that they offered us a late check out when we told them that our flight was at 7 o clock in the afternoon.. Quiet neighborhood, just 30 min walking from the city center.",The Landmark Nicosia

My ""10"" is not sufficient for evaluation. Congratulations Hilton Cyprus for your great people!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I have stayed in rooms from Mozambique to Abu Dhabi and paid from $40 to $900 USD per night for a room. The Hilton Cyprus has the finest and friendliest service in the world. They seem to grasp the fact that for business traveler like myself...my hotel is my home. They seem approach their ""jobs"" with the understand that this is my LIFE! Prehaps they think I am a king or a president or even that my last name is Hilton (it's actually Ritz) I am treated as though my satisfaction and happiness is all they care about.The food is great and reasonably priced. Great breakfast and a good bar. Clean room and a comfortable bed. Nice neighborhood and an ample executive lounge. I visited the gym twice a day for GREAT workouts and they have helpful staff there also.At the end of the day it is people who make the difference and these are the best. Maria at the front desk greets me with a smile as does Elana. Another Maria checks with me to confirm that my room is right. There are too many to name, I mention these because they are the last two I saw. My drinks are always full and the food is fast and right and the managers are there to check on it.The only bad news is that the price at the Hilton Cyprus will increase out of necessity because this high level cannot be offered at this low price.From the heart...this is the best hotel service I have ever had.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I am fortunate to stay at the Hilton Cyprus each time I visit the island on business. The rooms are a good size, clean and well maintained. Staff are attentive and friendly.My only heads-up would be regarding the baths/ shower. The baths have a curved bottom and care should be taken not to trip or fall when taking a shower.Facilities are great and the city centre is only a short walk (or even shorter taxi ride) away.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,Overall a good experience but bar was not open as advertised. 1st night it took half hour for someone to man the bar. The second night we just gave up! This was around 6pm. Only heat came out of so called A/C so we were not totally comfortable at night.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for three nights in early March 2015. The outside of the building is non-descript but once you are inside it's old school Hilton luxury all the way. The staff can not do enough for you. They are friendly but not familiar. My room was fresh, clean and well maintained. No stains on the carpet and worn chair upholstery here. It is clear that nothing but top drawer service and facilities will be accepted by the management of this hotel. Business travelers will appreciate the variety of gift shopping opportunities available right in the hotel. Travelling for business is hard enough, this Hilton makes it a pleasure..",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"On last December our company organised a lunch at Hilton Cyprus to appreciate their VIP customers for the great co-operation. The ball room was nice and well decorated for our occasion. The staff was very kind during the event. The food, just perfect! Tasty and nice served. The quantity good for men and women.

40,"I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occasions in the past few weeks for business.The hotel is well positioned, being a 5 minute drive from Nicosia town centre.Room: I've had varying treatment in my rooms. The first i was greeted with courtesy fruit and water. Second and third time, no water or fruit, although reception offered free water when I asked. Overall the rooms are good and have a nice balcony if you want to sleep with fresh air rather than ac. Only criticisms are that the shower is not powerful, wifi is not free and walls are bit too thin, when trying to sleep next to noisy neighbours.Food: breakfast has a fantastic selection and staff are willing to go out of their way to make it very enjoyable for you. In terms of food service one member of staff particularly stood out. His name was Panayiotis and he every breakfast and dinner very enjoyable!Dinner is good, with a wide selection and meat quality was high. My only criticisms would be that I would question if my broccoli was cooked from frozen (still not sure...) and it's slightly overpriced compared to options in the town centre.Overall very nice with and fantastic group of staff. I'm looking forward to my next stay, especially breakfast!",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I stayed at the hotel during a business trip. The room was a decent size and had a little balcony. It was on the 7th floor and there weren't any noise issues. Bed was comfortable and shower was lovely. I had a few meals- breakfasts and dinner- all were good, fresh and tasty. Breakfast is wonderful and has a good selection. I used the gym and it was just as expected. The hotel is located one hour drive from Larnaca airport and a few minutes drive from Nicosia's main attractions. The biggest asset of the hotel- the staff. All are extremely courteous and friendly, starting from the receptionists to the waiters and luggage keepers. I needed a late checkout and it was approved immediately and with a smile!I will definitely return to this hotel on my next trips.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We stayed four nights at the Hilton Cyprus and enjoyed every night. The rooms were typical Hilton, clean, and quiet. The ventilation is lacking a little so it helps to open the window at night. The hotel staff were excellent and very helpful. The breakfast, which was included in our rate, was buffet style but they were quite willing to provide special orders at no additional cost. The hotel is located about a 15 minute walk or 6 Euro taxi ride to Ledra Street and all the shopping.The hotel is relatively old, but it obviously has been renovated but still retains the charm of days past. Free internet is available in the public areas but costs extra for in room. The speed of the internet is very good.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"A City Centre hotel which has a fantastic swimming pool and reasonable leisure facilities, very smart, recently refurbished - functional but pleasant bedrooms. The lobby is still the place to have coffee and be seen. We have been staying here for the past 10 years on and off and the staff are lovely. It is also incredibly child friendly but then so is all of Cyprus. It isn't cheap even now, but it is worth it if you can. Good for local watching, for business and for relaxation. Also the chance to see Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"While clean and confortable, there is no food or alchohol except between 1700 till 1900, as well as no staff on station. Not up to Hilton standards. Staff overall are great, though. It's just the short sighted cheap policy that is annoying.",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"Stayed here for three nights - hotel was fine, and a good place to stay in Nicosia if you need to go there for business. If on holiday, this isn't the hotel for you. While the pool looks nice, it was empty the whole time I was there (despite it being May and very warm). There is also very little to do nearby",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The hotel is a beautiful property, well maintained and comfortable.The service was exceptional. The reception, restaurant and management all provided a level of care that we have seldom experienced elsewhere. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff were friendly without being over familiar. We will not hesitate to return to this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,I was at the hotel on a business trip with my three moth old baby and was very impressed by the staff at the hotel. there was always willing to help with a smile. If I needed a housekeeper late at night they had no problem sending someone up to assist with what I requested.The room itself was nice and clean!Highly Recommend!,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This is one of the rare cases where I completely disagree with the reviews. Hilton cyprus deserves the highest rating- a 5 not a 4. It is a very nice Hilton, very upscale with a service that is wonderful- lovely staff everywhere from the reception to the breakfast area etc... Rooms are large and very comfortable. Food is excellent- had the lunch buffet when we arrived and loved it, great value for excellent food. Breakfast buffet is nice. Location is great for Nicosia, close to everything. A 5 rating for sure!",The Landmark Nicosia

The Executive rooms are spacious, well equipped, and the lounge is nice too. The staff make this hotel. Every member of staff I had contact with was welcoming with a smiley face, and an offer to help. Very refreshing. Well done Hilton, and nice stay, just too short.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"After having stayed in not so decorated hotel in Larnaca, but great property and service, Hilton Nicosia turned out to be a damp squib. No free internet, no water bottle and service was certainly less than expected. Property is good but wish it can give a better service.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We had a very comfortable stay in a suite which was very roomy. The decor is a little dated but everything was comfortable. We had a very friendly and attentive greeting on our arrival. All the staff we saw were friendly and efficient. The only reason for not giving the hotel a five star rating is that firstly the complimentary water was not replenished in the room, neither was the coffee used or the cream. We would also question the evening executive lounge happy hour which is from 5.00 to 7.00 most people on business would not be able to use it so early. We arrived too late the first night at just before 7 and the second night we only managed the last15 minutes. A 5.30/6.00 start would be more sensible finishing at 7.30/8.00. However the staff were very nice.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,We arrived at the hotel mid-morning expecting to have to leave our bags with the concierge. We were very pleasantly surprised when they offered to give us immediate access to our room.The decor in the room was a little dated but spotless and we were very comfortable.The Executive Lounge was excellent with a great choice of items and again very attentive service.Altogether an excellent stay and we would love to go back.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The staff at this hotel were really outstanding from the friendly receptionist who gave us early access to our executive pool-facing room, the executive housekeeper who came out to greet us, the porter who explained the facilities on the way to our room, and the lady in the executive lounge who kept ensuring we had everything we wanted.The room was traditionally furnished. OK the furniture might be a bit dated, but the bed was comfortable and we slept very well.Breakfast was one the best we had in Cyprus. Despite the hotel being very quiet - it was just after New Year - a full buffet selection was put out. Eggs were freshly cooked to order on our request.The only negative was the poor internet service - it kept cutting out every hour requiring you to put your details in again each time",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This is an excellent hotel, with about a 10 minute walk to the city center of Nicosia. The rooms are a good size, good decor and clean. The food in the hotel in very good with breakfast being a buffet and having the room service at night was also very good and speedy. The hotel is massive and consists of a gym, bar (theyll put football on for you if you ask) etc. The staff are lovely and very friendly.Would thoroughly recommend this hotel",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"On my first visit ever to Cyprus, I chose this hotel and was not disappointed. It is located within a not-so-interesting 20-25 minute walk from the city centre. However, a taxi costs approximately 8 € and there is a direct bus line (#160). If you opt for the bus, please check the schedule before in the web.The hotel itself is very clean and well maintained. The staff is overall friendly and corteous. I had access to the executive lounge, which offers virtually almost a warm dinner (pasta, salads, warm food, beer and wine) from 5 to 7 p.m. There is no breakfast in the lounge, but for those staying in the executive floor there is a breakfast free of charge in the restaurant downstairs. I only missed some international newspapers in the lounge. There is a free internet in the lobby. It might be a good idea to extend it to the lounge (even if there are two computers with internet connection there).The room was very nice and comfy. My room was towards the street, but on the 6th floor I was not at all disturbed by the traffic. The minibar is quite basic and the bathroom could be more modern, but both of them were just ok for me. The television set is a bit oldish, I missed some tv channels, including the German RTL and BBC.I enjoyed very much the swimming pool. Although it is not huge, it is large enough for swimming. There are also two different saunas (Turkish and Finnish), as well as a whirlpool. I appreciated very much that this hotel maintains separate saunas for men and for women, as I have some negative experiences from the mixed ones in other countries.The Hilton breakfast is excellent with a nice view towards the outdoor pool. Also the bars and the restaurants looked nice, but unfortunately I found no time for them. I am quite sure that I will return to this hotel on my next visit to Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia

I did not like to have to pay to use the business center with the internet.Once you pay so much for a room, this should be for free. otherwise it was ok, the personnel very helpful and I had a good time.",The Landmark Nicosia

My room was clean and comfortable, decor a little dated but nice addition of a balcony and good amenities. The Executive Lounge was great, a very good selection of hot and cold dishes and excellent salads and desserts in the evenings with good wines or beer. Breakfast was also good but not in the lounge, in the main restaurant, with a good varied selection of everything.The hotel has several shops and a hair salon, a gym and an indoor pool, also used by local with membership.The location was quiet and just a 20 minute walk to the main centre of Nicosia … all in all a good hotel and i would stay here again if in the area.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,The Hilton is a nice hotel with a few flaws but dealt with professionally. I had a burger the first night and asked for medium but it came well done. The meat used was quality and tasted fine and when I showed the waiter that it was well done they were very apologetic and didn't charge me for my beer.I had asked for English breakfast tea bags but none were left and also no milk but when i asked for them they not only left more but also complimentary water and fruit.I was disappointed to find that they advertise free Wi-Fi on their website but actually you have to click on a link to see that it is only in the public areas and not the room. I was also not informed that my conference party had a special rate. I was led to believe it was 4 Euro/hour but in fact it was only 5 Euro/day for us.The breakfast is first class and overall a nice hotel,The Landmark Nicosia

The people of Hilton brought me medication, offered me a soup to calm my stomach and generally did everything possible during the whole day to make me feel better. People working there is the comparative advantage of Hilton, reminding me the good old days of greek hospitality.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"Stayed here last week and cannot fault the hotel. It is spotlessly clean, as you would expect. It has excellent amenities and unique little shops.The staff are amazing. Very attentive and friendly.The food was fabulous from the breakfast to lunch snacks and dinner.Having access to the executive lounge was very welcomed. Again the staff were excellent.This is not a cheap hotel, it is of a high Hilton standard, and as such, be prepared to pay higher prices for food and drinks!!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Hotel immaculate and all the staff were so accommodating to please. Food excellent. I asked for gluten free pasta and chef made a beautiful dinner for me. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms lovely and very comfortable beds. Fantastic gym with all spa amenities. Location good, easy to get to old part of town. Has executive lounge which served delicious nibbles, wine etc . Only downside is drinks price rather high.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We recently spent seven nights at the Hilton on our two week trip around Cyprus. As HH member I enjoy the standard the Hilton gives me. The service was excellent, staff helpful as per normal. As said by other reviewers the rooms are tired but clean. Slept well in comfortable bed, yummy breakfasts, plenty of onsite parking and ease of access to the freeway and surrounding attractions.",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"The rooms at the Hilton Cyprus felt dated and tired, from the curtains with an 80's print to the carpeted floors. The bathroom felt basic and utilitarian, lacking a luxurious feel, save for the beautiful marble tabletop. Thankfully, the bed itself was comfortable, and I slept well.I was told that as a HHonors Diamond member, I had been assigned a Club Room. Unfortunately, it wasn't overlooking the pool. The cleanliness of the room left something to be desired. There was some hair on the bathroom floor upon checking into the room - this remained on the floor when I checked out after 2 nights! The room itself felt dusty and a little stale. A lack of cleanliness is a deal-breaker for me.The most positive redeeming factor was the breakfast. The hotel offers an excellent selection of vegetarian food options. The selection of fresh cheeses, the grilled haloumi, tomatoes stuffed with cheese, sauteed mushrooms, beans, rosti potatoes etc. provided an excellent choice of savoury food options. This was over and above the usual range of pastries. I enjoyed having my breakfast outdoors, by the poolside.The service was hit and miss. I called reception to ask for a bottle of water. I was informed that the hotel only provides 2 complementary bottles upon check in (1 still and 1 sparkling). I was told that if I wanted more water, I should go to the Club Room to get some. I didn't have a chance to visit the Club Room, but I was surprised by this curt and unhelpful response. On the other hand, I encountered a very helpful staff member who organised taxis for the guests.",The Landmark Nicosia
20,"We booked an executive suite for two nights as a special treat for me and my husband.. the room was really good (spacious and clean) but that was the only Hilton-standard experience for our stay..All the rest were disappointing:-They were charging us €15 for 24 hours internet access for our room.. We were paying for an executive suite with access to the executive lounge; we could have free internet access in public places but NOT in our room, despite the charge rate.... In many other Hilton hotels across the world, internet is complementary...-Breakfast selection not that great and bad service. We were just greeted at the entrance but then we were left to choose our table and also to search for the waitress so we could have hot drinks (coffee and tea). There was no milk left on our table for tea (both mornings), so again I had to ask for the waitress to bring me more. Is this expected from Hilton?? No I don't think so.- Room service is hilarious: we ordered a margarita pizza to share with my husband and a bottle of wine.. In my opinion it is one of the most simple option for room service. They called us 10 minutes later to say that they were out of pizza(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). We ordered something alternative and then when the food arrived, they only brought 1 glass for the wine.... and this is a ""5"" star hotel...-Prices overall were expensive and not worth it.. We wanted to order room breakfast; breakfast was included in price we paid but the room breakfast menu included very few items that were included in the price. In addition, there was extra charge €12 per person for room breakfast plus a €3.5 charge for the room service and extra charges for the breakfast selections. Even though we didn't go for the room breakfast, the breakfast at the restaurant was not great either (as commented above).If I knew better I would have booked somewhere else; If you are attending for a seminar/course, location is a good but all the rest is not worth it.Hilton management most probably will not comment on my review, but for all of you travelers do make a good search for other hotels in Nicosia!!!This is so disappointing, given the standards of other 5 star hotels in the island...",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I would have given this lovely hotel 5 stars, but another wifi rip off. We have been travelling for 2 months and this is the first hotel that charged for wifi. We paid to be upgraded to the executive lounge and this didn't have wifi access at all! Our room was well appointed, spacious and luxuriously furnished. The food was excellent and the sports facilities and indoor and outdoor pool outstanding. Public areas are luxurious. The staff are friendly and helpful. One anomaly with our room was no plug in the bathroom for the hairdryer. I had to sit on the floor in the hall to dry my hair. All facilities are spotlessly clean.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I would not stay in ANY other hotel in the city. Absolutely the best. The rooms are excellent it is conveniently located close to old town. The staff is top notch, the fitness center is outstanding. The breakfast is the perfect way to start the morning, great food and great selection.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"As Hilton is considered the top Hotel of the Capital, I have to write a usefull review for the Management. I was attenting a Forum last week, which lasted almost the whole day. The conference was set up perfectly, there is no complaint indeed, but few thinks during the breaks. During the first coffee break, while geting served a cup of coffee, all by sudden the service supervisor had cought two pieces of pies or something in front of our eyes, and moving them with a cup of coffee behind the conference room for his own consumption. Stricktly, unacceptable. The major issue came up when started served for lunch. Food presenation and taste very good, my compliments to the Chef, their were no ladles or whatever placed on the dishes in order for us to get served and we had to catch the dishes by using our hands. The service supervisor was just watching us and almost by the end of the lunch, another waitress all by sudden had placed them on the dishes(by the way are called Bain Maries). Unacceptable service by such a high reputable hotel. Hopefully, that my commend will wake up the service even the management team in general.Thnx.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I was working in Nicosia, so spent 2 weeks at the hotel.The hotel is a little isolated, being about 1.5km away from the Old Town which is the hub for the city. There are few restaurants nearby so fortunately there are a few options within the hotel itself. Traveling for work I often prefer the informality of the bar to the restaurants, so it worth noting that room dining menu was more extensive than the bar menu.There is a very useful shop on the ground floor selling essentials, in case you run short or forgot something.There is a taxi office on-site so getting to and from the hotel is quick and efficient.As well as an outdoor pool, there is an indoor pool. The fitness room is equipped 8 running machines and a range of rowing, cycles etc. Very welcome as running outdoors would be pretty difficult unless it's very early or very late.The room was very comfortable, very quiet and well maintained. It's worth mentioning that Greek television broadcast some US films and shows in English with Greek subtitles, so for those of you stuck working in your room have an option other than BBC World news, Sky news and Bloomberg.Wi-Fi is available free in the bar. In teh room it was charged at 5 Euros for 24 hours, no matter what option I choose from the menu. I didn't try NetFlix but for work it proved sufficiently fast and very reliable.I made use of the laundry service, which was returned when promised.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,I spent 2 weeks at this hotel while on a working trip to Nicosia. The hotel itself is excellent. The staff were helpful and friendly. The room was clean and (overlooking the pool) quiet. There is a very useful shop on the ground floor for toiletries and other emergency supplies. The fitness center was pretty well equipped with running machines. Running outdoors is difficult in the 30 degree heat! The hotel itself is a little isolated from town (about 1.5 km). Fortunately the hotel has several dining options so the relative lack of other options isn't too much of a problem. There is an on-site taxi office so getting to and from the hotel was never a problem.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"For the business traveller, the Hilton Cyprus is definitely the best place to stay in Nicosia. It has old world 60's Hilton charm, but is otherwise a totally modern hotel. Rooms are large and if you sit in the lobby long enough, you will just about see everyone you thought you should and possibly forgot. Highly recommended.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Good hotel but I always feel that I am paying over the odds for a Hilton.The issue that I have with Hilton hotels is their backward approach to providing room wifi access, ie extortionate prices when compared to free or lower cost wifi provided in other non-Hilton hotels.I discovered that it also costs more if you pick up a breakfast card from the reception compared to going straight to the restaurant - ?Both points leave me with a negative perception of Hiltons.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"A good hotel, very helpful staff especially the evening front desk. Excellent swimming pool where you can relax and also do laps. Food is reasonable, rooms are reasonable, beds not totally comfortable - need turning more often",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed at Hilton Nicosia for two nights, the rooms comfortable and with balcony, the staff are friendly and ever obliging.The hotel is a short walk to the old city but well worth visiting, then cross over to the occupied territory if you desire, you must show your passport before doing so.The pool is large and inviting, it certainly is a great place to stay.thanks to Christos and Marcus and your friendly efficient service.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Being set well off the main road, the hotel is quiet - we had a room overlooking the front of the hotel but there was no traffic noise. Old city is a brisk 20-25 minute walk and it is worth visiting the Turkish side as well for some fascinating buildings.The reception area was bright, airy and clean and the reception staff were very polite and helpful.The rooms are rather small, with very dated decor. The bathroom was tiny - the door would not fully open and you cannot have two people in the room at the same time! Decor in the bathroom was tired and tatty; the shower is a drippy affair in the bath, with a squalid shower curtain.There in no free in-room wifi, which these days is just ripping people off. There is only free wifi in reception and it is slow and inconvenient. If Hilton Hotels really wanted to compete with Marriott etc, they really have to look at this.Breakfast was very good, but if you eat outside there is no point in asking for a non-smoking table as the staff let people smoke anywhere anyway, even next to the no smoking signs!Our one experience of the hotel dining facilities was very poor. There was a large wedding going on and the hotel could not cope with its own guests as well as the wedding guests and the paying residents were clearly less important.We attempted to have a pre-dinner drink at the bar; the bar was closed as they ""did not have enough staff"". We therefore had to order drinks and have them in reception. However, we could not have our preferred drinks, because the necessary spirits for cocktails were in the bar...!Our food was dry, overcooked, tasteless and our order was taken three times. The meal that arrived bore little resemblance to the description and when we questioned this, we were told it was because the kitchen were ""busy"" and did not have enough time to cook certain items. The waitress was trying to remove my wife's completed meal before I had finished mine; the waiter was constantly hovering to see how quickly we were finishing and yet did not bother topping up wine and water glasses. Terrible service.I had to refuse to pay for my dessert, which was inedible.Overall the hotel is ""OK"", but had to be marked down on the fact that they can't deal with weddings without it affecting the paying guests. This is unacceptable and reflects very badly on the chain.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"Stayed here for two nights on business.Plus points are the eatery by the pool, it was good to eat out in Sept and the service was ok.Rooms look tired and I agree there is no need to be charging for wifi in the rooms, that is a complete rip off and I'm not bothered who is a member of what Hilton loyalty programme.Breakfast was very good and the staff were very helpful. I'll stay here again.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,This seemed like a newer hotel with an expansive lobby and a variety of shops inside. There were restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel as well as a variety of shops. The hotel was immaculately maintained. There is a nice breakfast served each morning in the restaurant with local and international foods. Lunch and dinner as well as a coffee bar and a regular bar are available in the lobby. I didn't have an issue with the wifi as a previous reviewer so I ll defer comment on that. The staff at the desk were extremely professional and couldn't do enough to make your stay a pleasant one. The executive lounge was one of the best I ve been to at Hilton Hotels.,The Landmark Nicosia

You have to pay for wi-fi separately. Most staff speak good English. The gym and pool are nice, I especially liked that the hot tub, sauan, and steam rooms were divided by gender, in the changing rooms. The gym even has free fitness classes!

50,We visited Hilton Cyprus for the last week in August and had a really relaxing time as planned but was overwhelmed by the friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us. Everybody we met from walking in to leaving a week later made us feel welcome and valued.The Hotel was quiet which apparently is the norm for August but was just what we wanted and having booked an executive room having the lounge facilities was definitely a bonus helping avoid the heat outside.We had a room by the main road which I had read on reviews was noisy but this was not the case as there was triple glazing on the balcony door. Walking into town in the evening was a pleasant 15 minute stroll and the old town just another 5 minutes but well worth visiting. The airport shuttle at €8 per person was worth using as there is a taxi rank at the Nicosia stop to take you onwards for a small fee,The Landmark Nicosia

The Club bedroom smelt a little like the gym but everything was there. The club lounge was deserted and staff were never there even when I called asking that the AC be turned up. When no-one came after several requests I asked for the Duty Manger but was advised he wasn't expected in for several hours! No answer to the question of who was in charge at that point in time! Food in lounge was sparse and the drinks limited to beer and not so good wine. Come on guys we spend a lot for a club room and deserve better? No breakfast was served there - you had to go to the main dining room which seemed always short of staff too. Where was the bar? If you wanted a drink you had to sit in the lobby or around the pool. The hotel looked busy but you felt that parts were shut down and that staff had been reduced to cut costs. It all worked, but only just!",The Landmark Nicosia

The hotel outdoor and indoor swimming pools are an advantage as you always have access to a pool whenever you are visiting.,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"I am a Hilton Honours member of many years and on the basis of my visit a few days ago to this hotel, I cannot possibly compare the Hilton in Nicosia with what is to be expected from a five star hotel in terms of accommodation and furnishings.The crisis of the Cyprus economy has not allowed this hotel to proceed with a much needed renewal of its furniture and equipment and at the same time prices have not fallen to allow for the discrepancy in expectations. It is a shame as this is a historic hotel.The hotel restaurants however are well worth a visit as they have good quality food, though on the expensive side.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I must say the staff was very helpful and were concerned about the guest; they guide you to the best knowledge. I stayed for 5 nights at Hilton Cyprus - Room No 607 having no compliant against the staff & their service was amazing. Breakfast & Sunday brunch buffet was very good; I liked the variety and quality of the food served. I never tried other in house restaurants as most evenings were business outings. The Location of hotel is not very far from the city center and is very quiet , peaceful out here with good swimming pool (for some unknown reasons it is quite popular among locals , as they always asked me to spent the evening there) , spa and gym facility.Room was OK types nothing so special with outdated interiors & furniture it seems you are in 90's but the balcony is the USP which is spacious and can sit out for morning coffee or smoke. The things which I always hate most is no complimentary Wi-Fi (you need to purchase but I got discounted price) and complimentary water (buy it from a grocery shop just opposite to the hotel).As I was at the Hotel during the world cup I was amazed that Hotel didn't had a TV channel showing matches with English commentary any how it was fine by me , all in all comfortable stay nothing special. I would have given GOOD rating but V.GOOD only because of the staff.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,The service was good and the service staff very helpful and welcoming. The restaurant needs to be open more often in this level of hotel. The only time in 7 days that I saw any senior management their only concern was the height of the rope surrounding the pool after it closed in the evening. They need to get out of their offices and walk about,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Very nice hotel, not in the center of the city, which is maybe the only disadvantage if you want to go shopping. Other wise the hotel is a great choice.Very good air conditioning system, which is a must in Nicosia even in June.The breakfast was excellent, I love Haloumi cheese which was served in the breakfast room along with other local and international delicacies.The business lounge was very good providing internet services and you could just about always find a free computer to use.Tasty light snacks were served from 6-8 I think as well as soft drinks and coffee that was always available.The room was spacious, clean with a nice view.The amenities (shampoo, conditioner etc. were of very good quality!I strongly recommend this hotel in Nicosia which is a very nice city. The only ugly thin in the city is its division in two areas and the fact that you need a passport to walk from the Cypriot-Greek area to the other.",The Landmark Nicosia

The hotel was clean and well maintained and nothing was too much trouble for the staff and I have to thank the “front desk” for their surprise birthdays treat which was most appreciated.It’s a bit out of town and I didn’t see any bars nearby. However, we were only there for one night so they may be some. We did walk to the old town and it took us about twenty minutes – we got a cab back!!If I was to venture back to Nicosia I would defiantly use this hotel again.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"A very good hotel with a magnificent lobby. I have only one complaint. The Internet connection in the hotel room was NOT complimentary, which it DEFINITELY SHOULD BE.

30,"We stayed here one week with 2 small children. The hotel is rated the second best on the island, and however that might be true - it’s not 100% up to the Hilton-standard.The rooms (executive 4th floor) look ok, clean - but the bathroom is very dated. They do provide for a laptop (somewhat ancient) in each room and the wifi is pretty solid and available throughout the entire hotel ground. The staff is friendly and helpful.The 6th floor executive lounge is very basic and not very attractive for vegetarians! Room service is fast and the menu is good.The breakfast is diverse, but isn’t replenished - lot is finished when you arrive at 9:30. And breakfast until 10am for a holiday hotel isn’t very accommodating.The pool area is spacious but it was really too hot to sit outside (45 deg!). The indoor pool was mostly occupied by swimming-classes. The outdoor area was also used by schoolchildren who were having their summer-school of some sort, which caused the necessary disturbance. I was therefor surprise to get a couple of comments about our children producing some noise outside. Playing with a ball is also not appreciated by the ‘lifeguard’. Who also serves as a pool boy and towel service.Overall - an ‘ok’ hotel, but certainly not a 5* Hilton experience. If we don’t go back there it’s because of the rest of the island which is pretty ‘boring’…",The Landmark Nicosia

It has a nice pool, excellent gym facilities but best of all, very thoughtful, helpful staff who really came to our rescue when British Airways failed to put our case on the plane at Heathrow. Breakfast was outstanding with, again, excellent staff doing their best to meet one's wishes. The only thing that stopped it being 5 star is that the bedrooms, although large and comfortable, are feeling a little dated. It's about a mile and a half out of Central Nicosia and on a busy road so it is worth paying a little extra for a room facing the pool as it provides more peace and quiet.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Nothing more to say than excellent - in particular the food was amazing, friendly staff and great pool area, perfect for 30degree heat, just watch your feet don't get burnt on the wooden deck!Only stayed a night, and had a hire car to get about, so the location wasn't too bad for me, but the island isn't too bad to get around, just be aware on the roads.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights as part of a business conference and really enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel delivers what Hilton promises in terms of quality, comfort and a great experience. I enjoyed their food in particular, especially the breakfast but also the lunch, they must have a really good chef! The staff at the reception are extremely helpful and very friendly. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone planning a visit to Nicosia!",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"We wanted to find a hotel of reasonable quality in the Greek part of Nicosia, and this turned out to be suitable. It would have been nicer to find one nearer the centre, but it did the job.We arrived by car and found the hotel easily as it is on the main road in from the south. The parking situation was confusing but the area marked for paying parking now seems to be free. There is even a petrol station on site.Wifi costs €15/day in room so we just used it free in public areas. Our room was large enough with a good bathroom including bath, balcony with view of southern part of the city, tea/coffee making equipment, and just about adequate lighting.There were no restaurants in easy reach so we choose to dine in the hotel both nights. The buffet at €20 was fairly good in both choice and quality, with a reasonable choice of wines at €30/bottle upwards. The buffet breakfast was reasonably good but not exceptional.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Cannot really complain about any aspect of Hilton Cyprus, it's an excellent choice if you are looking for a great hotel in Nicosia. It's a favourite among business travellers as well.Plus points:- Very nice facilities, two different restaurants, bar, pool, gym, sauna etc.- The rooms are spacious and well-equipped- The whole place is nicely appointed, with a touch of local style and spotless-clean- Food in the restaurant is of good quality (albeit a bit expensive)- Staff is excellent, helpful and polite. They also acknowledged my HHonors status, providing a free drink at the barMinus points (and they are only slight) :- Price of Internet connectivity (15 euros)- Price of food at the restaurant- Windows were outdated and did not do a perfect job at keeping out humidity and noiseAs you understand, it's an overall excellent hotel and the minus points I could find are really not worth talking about. It's definitely one of the best hotels you can find in Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"I stayed here as I was attending a conference here, but that is all I would stay here for. It is definitely not somewhere I would come to for a holiday stay. If seemed quite average to me, with a basic swimming pool, a restaurant and a few small shops in the lobby area.I had the artichoke salad which was the highlight for me! I had it 4 times and really really liked it! The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were nice, but I'd only recommend this hotel for a few nights' stay.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Great hotel, clean rooms, pleasant and helpful staff, good room rates, tasty and various food offer for breakfast and lunch. Only drawbacks of this hotel are: no free internet in the room, You have to pay a lot additionally to have good access in room. You have to go down to lobby to reach really slow internet. Another one is location - to close to busy street and little to far from city center (25-30 minutes walk along that busy street).",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"Booked the Hilton for my Myself, Wife and daughter.Thought that being the most expensive in Nicosia it would be the best.On arrival found the car park small and full, difficult to park in the Hotel which is the place you want to park as you are staying there but after going around and around finally found a spot.The Hotel itself very beautiful inside with shops to buy things if you care to spend a fortune.The reception staff very friendly, polite.The room ummm well small would be good description to start with, appears the hotel is not geared up for family rooms unless i am wrong, my wife and i had a Double bed and my daughter had a put up bed shoved against the window and balcony door.Our bed was very poor standard i have stayed in alot of hotels and only just started writting reviews but the bed was slightly banana shape and not flat, cannot count how many hotels i have stayed in but this was third in the worse catagory. the worse being the Thurrock M25 Travellodge in London.I did not sleep good but my wife said it was ok, my daughter said the put up bed was uncomfortable.My next review will be the Quality Plymouth International New Zealand where i can say the room slighty but only just bigger with a lovely double and single bed same layout as the Hilton but totaly different catagory.In short the beds not so good the furniture not as would be expected of Hilton. trying to look classy but ive seen better.We ate in the Restauraunt, My wife and i had fillet the daughter something else the food was beautiful and the service by our waiter very good, find it a bit hard to swallow that the food cooked and prepared so well, time and effort was below 100 Euros but the bottle of Moet we had avilable in the food market at 38 Euros was sold for 140 i am not tight by far but crazy money.So as of the other descriptions yes nice hotel food good staff, lovely.People be aware that you are paying for the name there are better hotels out there.I mentioned this the the staff as we left, the young girl apologised not that it was her fault and like a tape recording when we said goodbye she said hope to see you again, i laughed bless her.So would we stay again, not sure maybe not this hilton not so good have stayed in better Hilton hotels, but if you want to show off go ahead.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This hotel was fantastic. All staff were very helpful and friendly and could not do enough if you did need any assistance. The breakfast was one of the very best that I have ever had in a hotel, the variety was amazing. The restaurant food was also really good, one night I ordered room service which arrived promptly. The gym is clean with good facilities. When I return to Cyprus I will most certainly look to stay here again.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Excellent is the word that can describe my total experience in Hilton Cyprus....And it is not the 1st time I' ve been there and surely not the last. The staff and management behavior is worth mentioned as well as the facilities. The breakfast is always excellent and the waiters extremely gentle and carrying,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"""Living"" in a hotel can be terribly booring - one month and counting for my case. But the staff of Hilton Cyprus have made my stay much more bearable. Claire Sirrieh, of Business Development, has really been helpful. Alexis Aravis and even the General Manager Marwan Ragheb have all helped me in some of my very exceptional requests or needs. Staff at Hilton have assisted me in very small issues like billing corrections to big issues like receiving parcels. Receptionists, room attendants, door men - all wear a smile all day - a quite difficult thing. When I complained about need to change room, it was done for my 2nd visit; when one of the bulbs went off, I got a visit from head of housekeeping; when I complained to have iron box changed, I got not only a newer iron box but also ironing board. I am still staying in the hotel and may end up spending upwards of 3 months but with such human touch, genuine smiles and great attention, I believe I will be comfortable and feel homely.I'd greatly recommend this hotel if staying in Nicosia; it is not only the best in the city but also close to Nicosia old town, Mall of Cyprus and many other key areas. Parking is free for those driving, taxis immediately available.S. Kiptoo Ng'eno",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We decided to spend our Christmas at Hilton in Nicosia.Our choice was mostly defined by the dogs we brought with us.When booking online, their website had an option: with or with pets.Later on I canceled my reservation and a friend of ours who was also coming with us made another reservation to qualify for a good deal, the deal I had missed when placing my reservation. So then my friend called the hotel, the receptionist was not sure if the dogs were allowed, to us it sounded a bit misleading (as spending Christmas with our dogs was our priority). at the end the receptionist checked with the manager and they confirmed that the dogs were allowed for some extra charges (50 EUR per day), (although our young Yorkshire Terrier ladies), are very tidy, tiny, cute and clean) fair enough!When we arrived and went to our rooms, we soon discovered we were in a part of the hotel which lacked the amenities corresponding with its five star rating. It was obvious that the rooms had not been remodeled for quite some time. This observation of ours does not necessarily describe the whole hotel but our rooms; as we then assumed we were given those rooms because of our dogs.The staff was very friendly and helpful.The food was great, really great!The Christmas dinner was also good, we expected it to be much more festive though. ( I do not want to sound like a spoiled brat, but we still expected the Christmas dinner to be a bit more festive even though there was a financial crisis).We really had a good time and hoping in the future the Hilton Hotel in Nicosia will provide much more modern room to the dog owner.LAST BUT NOT LEAST, the house made muffins were some of the finest pastries that we had ever eaten. You could tell that the muffins were made with love.The end of our story!",The Landmark Nicosia

The hotel is particularly clean and the food is of a very high standard. We would definately stay in this hotel again.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip with my husband. We stayed in an executive room which was very nicely decorated and a good size. The bed was very comfortable with good pillows and bed linen. The towels and bathrobes were lovely and fluffy and good quality. The room had everything we expect eg iron hair dryer safe tea and coffee making facilities. The lounge was nice with snacks etc. the only downside was the Internet facilities in the bedroom and lounge which were an extra charge. The staff were all pleasant and helpful. I unfortunately left my jewellery in the room when we checked out and only realised the following day. Thankfully we were still in the country and I rang the hotel who informed me it had been handed in by the cleaner. The staff are obviously honest and this is nice to see in a large hotel. Would definitely stay here again.,The Landmark Nicosia

40,"I stayed at the Hilton Cyprus on business in January 2014. It is a clean, well maintained and comfortable international business hotel and I enjoyed my stay. The staff were helpful and polite. Breakfast and dinner were also good, although the evening I ate in the restaurant my colleague and I were the only two people in the restaurant. I imagine it would be different in the summer.My only criticism was the absurdly expensive wifi in the room - it can only be a matter of time until Hilton realise that this is something that its customers demand for free in the 21st century.Overall the hotel was very nice, if a little characterless - but when travelling on business that is not necessarily a bad thing.",The Landmark Nicosia
20,"When one books a Hilton room, he expects a very good experience. Unfortunately, the Hotel is pretty old, the rooms need to be renovated, carpet is deteriorated. As i ordered room service for an adapter plug for charging my phone, i was told that they don't have any, they don't have any shoe polish or brush for the suits. And for a 5 star hotel, having one restaurant is not acceptable. My stay was in February.",The Landmark Nicosia

Very swift service at checkout.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed here for business in November 2013 - and as the title suggests you expect good quality from the Hilton brand and generally you get it. Breakfast was fantastic, great range of food and drink and also open for a good period of time. I ordered off the room service menu and this was again good quality. Hotel bar stocked a good range of alcohol although I was slightly disappointed that it closed relatively early during my stay. As other reviewers have noted, lack of free wi-fi is the main disappointment but there is free wi-fi in the lobby, which was useful for meetings or when waiting for colleagues etc. The double room itself had air-conditioning which is of course handy, nice size tv with good range of channels and a work desk which was ideal. Booked a taxi transfer to and from Larnaca airport for 50 euros each way which was quite good, and this was done through the hotel. All in all, a good place to stay in Nicosia!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"My first stay at this hotel. Great service and excellent amenities, comfort and hospitality. Would definitely stay again if I ever need to return to Nicosia.My only disappointment related to the lack of free wifi in rooms - it's not for the couple of euros you are asked as charge but more a matter of ""principle"" :) ...

40,"I stayed here for the 3rd time on New Year's Eve with my sister. I have fond memories of this hotel who did their utmost to make previous stays extremely comfortable for my late mother. We were upgraded to an executive room as usual as Diamond VIPs and received two vouchers for complimentary cocktails. The room was traditional but had every amenity including a laptop to access the internet. The drink order was misunderstood in the bar as we order a brandy sour and an ouzo special but received two brandy sours. The executive lounge had a good range of drinks and canapés. As we were leaving the hotel at 7 am on New Year's Day we were told we could have breakfast delivered to our room for 6.30am. I completed the order card and went to hand it in at reception but was told to hang it on my door outside and it would be collected during the night. I did this. Next morning we got up at 6.15 to find the order card still hanging on the door handle! I had to go down to reception and complain. The duty person was apologetic and the man who should have collected the order card was contrite. However, this should not have happened. In the end the breakfast was prepared and delivered to the room for 6.30am but it did cause unnecessary stress on our day of departure. This did taint our enjoyment somewhat but I have to say that the welcome at reception was highly professional. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who is considering staying in Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia

30,Why stay so conservative and stuffy? Perhaps a little more character would regain some of the lost brand value. Staff need a personality injection and lounges need some natural contributions to the look and feel. Then there is the minimal basic environmental effort. Why charge for even basic level wireless in rooms when we all need to check emails?,The Landmark Nicosia

The housekeeping staff were very efficient, they organised my bathroom products in a way that was more efficient than how I had it.My room was away from the pool and quite noisy on occasion, on one night I was kept awake by a group in a pub across the road singing or someone singing somewhere.The breakfast was good, not a lot of hot choice but sufficient for my needs. The buffet lunch was over priced for the choice, I paid £24 to eat a spoon of pasta and a couple of pieces of potato. Not the best lunch ever.There is WiFi in the public areas, the pool was amazing and the staff were really friendly. I would happily stay again. A little pricey for the room and a colleague was in a hotel next door which was a lot cheaper and nicer but the staff make up it.",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"So, I've stayed here around 5 times. I've always considered it luxury. This time, not so much. The problem is that it's fine - but expensive, and way too expensive for ""fine"". It's a business hotel, quite far from the centre of Nicosia, so it needs to be worth staying for business. The lobby is perfect for business meetings, but the only free wifi in the hotel is in the lobby. It's 7 euros for 2hrs in your room - and while it used to be cumulative so 2hrs could last a couple of days of quickly checking email between meetings, it is now a constant period. It's 15 euros for 24hrs, and when you're paying 155 euros for a night (without breakfast), that seems a little bit cheeky. The breakfast buffet is good - but not worth paying on a walk-in basis, but the pool bar seems good value (17 euros for a cheeseburger) until you remember that it wouldn't be good value anywhere other than a hotel that's already stupidly expensive. Over 5 euros for a coke or a filter coffee, and it becomes an expensive stay. While I'm on business, I don't believe in wasting my business's money on paying for wifi when it should be free. The bathroom in my room is a bit out-dated and could be modernised quite easily (a better shower would be a good start); and some of the rooms have a really rubbish view for that money. Bizarrely, when I checked-in, I was told I had ""a very nice room on the 4th floor"". It really isn't. This may be petty (but I'm paying 155 euros a night) but: 1. there's nowhere to easily put cosmetics for getting ready in front of the mirrow. 2. If you're using a hairdryer or straighteners, the plugs are in a strange place, unless you're going to dry your hair in a steamy bathroom. 3. There are no power points near the bed. I use my phone all day, every day. At night, I need to charge my phone while also using it as an alarm - I don't think I'm alone in that. 4. Crappy view.I'm falling out of love with this hotel - I used to look forward to it, but I guess I've found hotels around the world where you get much more for your money. If this hotel is going to continue being a business hotel, they might want to start considering offering free wifi throughout. It's 2013, it shouldn't be too difficult. Sorry Hilton, you've disappointed me this time.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,I was very much impressed with the quality of the staff immediately on arrival and all through my stay until leaving. I expected this to be just a standard Hotel stay where it is just a bed for the night. I was so wrong. Everyone is so happy and helpful. What a pleasant surprise from some of the other 5* hotels in which I have stayed. The room was very clean with a comfortable bed and the usual amenities. The hotel has an ample carpark and the location is excellent for driving into the city. I will certainly return and would recommmend this to all.,The Landmark Nicosia
10,"This hotel is way off the mark....one morning at breakfast, after being seated at a table that lacked silverware or a coffee mug, I waited about 5 minutes and then got up and got the items myself from a near-by table. After waiting an additional 15 minutes for coffee, I finally just got up and walked over to the waitress stand and poured my own coffee and went back to my table. FAIL. I had an early flight and arrived at the hotel at 1100, when I tried to check in I was told ""Your room is ready, but if you want it now, you need to pay for an extra 1/2 day."" So you would rather let a room sit empty for a few extra hours and upset a guest? Not such a great buisness decision. Also, internet...I go buy a coffe for 1 euro or a hamberger for 2 euros and get free internet. I go to your hotel and pay 200 euro per night for an ""exec"" room and you want to charge me an extra 15 euro for internet??",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Hilton Cyprus offers a warm and professional staff and environment in which you can conduct both business and pleasure. The rooms are quiet and conducive to working without being disturbed.

They lent me money when their atm refused to take my USA debit card.The rooms are outdated. The gym doesn't open til six. No adaptors to be found when I forgot mine. When I called down at five am, the phone rang 20 times before someone picked up. I told the president's advisor to send these folks to Dubai to see what customer service is all about.Internet is 15 euro a day. 45 for 3 days. Bargain?Location isn't great. East of the city 8 euro ride to get downtown.Breakfast was excellent. Meats, cheeses, yogurt, eggs, muffins, omelettes, potatoes. And plenty of coffee and juicesI checked out and went to the lower class asty hotel. And am so much happier there.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"This hotel has seen better days but it's still the best choice in Nicosia. The rooms may not be the most modern but they are comfortable as you'd expect from the chain & spotlessly clean. The staff are friendly especially at breakfast. The breakfast buffet offers an excellent range of choicesI was a little disappointed this time to discover that the pool is now only open from 9:30 or so instead of being available at your own risk outside of the lifeguarded period. That made it almost impossible on a business trip to use the pool, which was a highlight for me on previous trips.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I spent 3 memorable nights at the Hilton a couple of weeks ago. There was no way that I would get to Nicosia and book elsewhere. Steadily top of every other hotel in Nicosia, it prides for its high standards and goals. Indeed regarding this year’s World Travel Awards the Hilton ranks first and has secured not only 1 but 2 Awards as the Leading Hotel, and also the First Leading Business hotel in the entire island. Undoubtedly it is the best choice for a hotel in Nicosia.LOCATION: Centrally located on one of the highest points of the city. On foot, it is a pleasant 15 minute stroll to the shopping area. Taxi fee €6.00 to €8.00. Buses #158, 160 or 166 from right outside the hotel take you to Solomou Square for €1.50. Use the Intercity green buses for Larnaca for €4.00 - 45 minutes. For Ayia Napa, Limassol or Paphos (€5 to €7 one way) the bus stop is a few metres on the opposite side.CHECK-IN: Efficient and swift. The bag was carried upstairs much before I came in the room.STAFF & MANAGEMENT: When I return to the Cyprus Hilton I feel like home. I have several friends and many acquaintances here so the welcoming is always warm. Regretfully due to the detrimental financial climate that Cyprus now finds itself in, alike many other businesses the Hilton had also been influenced adversely and I noticed people from the staff missing. The unity and understanding of the staff struggling even with less people to meet the demands of their guests impressed me. I came across optimistic people, positive energy and high spirits -the spirit of Cypriots in times of turbulence. An unbeatable team, many of whom are multilingual experts and the percipient observer notices instantly the value of these people and how they perceive to make guests feel at home. You don’t have to be a repeater to feel this exceptional personalized treat. You feel it even if you come here for the first time. The human side of this hotel is remarkable and makes the difference.INTERIOR: Classic touch of luxury, elegance and glamour that travels you. It pays to go around and spot these details yourselves. Starting from the impressive lounge where guests can take their afternoon tea over the sounds of soft music, to the Paddock bar for a drink and its relaxing atmosphere. Then walking towards the lifts there is no way you expect them to be so ostentatious but they are and it is a fact. On the way you come across some awesome boutiques which the hotel houses on the ground floor promenade. You might get the impression that everything out here costs a fortune but on the contrary I have noticed some excellent bargains and the prices are reasonable.ROOM: Being a frequent guest I was upgraded to a King Hilton Executive, a 30m² room. There was a long welcoming message left for me on the big flat TV screen, and a laptop on the corner desk table. I noticed the WI FI was way faster than the previous time I was here a few months back and using it now was like working from home. The demanding businessman can find no other accommodation of such comfort, with so many functional amenities, eloquent silence in amazing ambience in the whole of Nicosia.The balcony overlooked the side of the pool. The usual warm tones of the interior, spacious and airy, impeccably clean and comfortable. I could not wait for the afternoon, the time I was enjoying my 2nd cup of coffee the sun flooding the room with light creating a warm and pleasant ambience. The king bed huge and soft with big fluffy pillows guarantees a good night sleep. Amenities like coffee/tea facilities, audible alarm, a huge flat TV with both standard Network & Premium (HBO,CNN, ESP). An iron board is always handy, a minibar, two phones one with Dataport. Delivery of local Newspapers plus a Video Cassette Recorder.BATHROOM: A good size standard in general bathroom with tiled floor and walls, a marble wash basin and a hand-held shower, but nothing clamorous. Toiletries are outstanding (Peter Thomas Roth) smell tangerine and favourite of mine, but I have to admit one tube of shower gel is too little. The size is small and the content of this small size is by far not enough. (Call housekeeping and you will have one or two extras). Bigger in size toiletries are given to the Really Top Executive Suites though!Robes, slippers, and the usual amenities like a magnified mirror, hair dryer, scales are provided. Due to this bad financial climate in Cyprus, (guests should have this in mind and be understanding) several of the ladies I knew in the housekeeping had to be dismissed. I missed Elena’s Oltu amazing decorations in the bathroom and bed. She was dismissed with several more. These extra touches of housekeeping service are missing. If you need a late afternoon housekeeping service, just call. Otherwise this is not at the moment provided…at least I have not seen the afternoon service during the time I was here. I also urge guests to let the management know of a demand they have instead of waiting until they get home and write a negative comment. This can only break the spell of your holidays.BREAKFAST: Breakfast is taken in the Fontana, the Signature Restaurant of the Hilton, popular in the entire island. Not even once had I read something negative regarding the Fontana. Breakfast was rich and adequate as always with anything one could imagine. There were plenty of normal/healthy option counters on hot/cold dishes. There is so much out here, enough to fill you up till dinner. Nice presentation, impeccable service, excellent quality.LUNCH/DINNER: The buffet lunch/dinner options are highly recommended. There is such a variety of everything that you cannot try it all. Quality is excellent, the service top, and tastes are yummy. If in the meantime you really love to eat, don’t bother get to a restaurant outside the Hilton because with much less you will realize that you are in a paradise of gastronomic bliss -the choice is extensive that you could ever wish for.THE A LA CARTE: The popular poolside bistro summer restaurant “Pergola” prides for its exquisite a la carte dishes. I have dined here a couple of times. If you visit the Hilton in the summer I urge you to dine here even for once….the experience will be memorable!THE FONTANA: With some friends we tried the a la carte menu of the Fontana this time. The salad that impressed me more was the Baked Goat Cheese Salad for €18.00. (Assorted Greens, Dry Figs and Cranberries, Walnuts & baked goat cheese served with balsamic & honey dressing). I can totally live on salads and I can say it was luscious. (The restaurant offers interesting choice of Vegetarian food as well).My main course was the Fresh Salmon Escalope served with Jumbo Prawns in Lobster sauce for €36.00. The side dish was spinach Timbale, Steamed Carrots, Parsley Potatoes. A dish I highly recommend to everyone who appreciates good food.My friends had the ‘Garidomakaronada’ - Jumbo Prawns with Tomato & Fresh Basil Sauce served with Tomato Spaghetti for €38.00. The dish was so tempting and I had a bite. It was a marvel -a dish to be considered.Cypriot wines are of excellent quality and we had the Aes Ampelis Rose (a Shiraz and Maratheftiko grape variety) served at €34.75 (per bottle) €9.00 (per glass).Another exceptional wine from the indigenous Xynisteri grape is ‘Petritis’ probably the most interesting dry wine that Cyprus has to offer at the moment, the unique wine to accompany seafood. A delightfully tasty wine and one of my favourite. It is served at the price of €28.25, - €7.50 per glass.For meat dishes highly recommended is the Kyperounda Cabernet Sauvignon. It leaves a sensuously lingering aftertaste and it is of excellent structure and full flavoured. It is served at the price of €44.25 (per bottle) and €12.00 (per glass).If you are at the Hilton you can accompany the above wine with the Baked Lamb Rack with Mustard Sauce. This dish is served on baked vegetables with herbed potatoes for the price of €33.00. An exceptional dish that meat lovers will adore it.EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: A complimentary option of snacks, beverage and dessert with breakfast included. All guests of the executive wing have access to this smart lounge which is quite popular. In reality it provides snacks and nibbles. (Of course coffee/tea facilities, bottled water and juices, bars of cereals and fruit are provided the day long). Comfortable and cozy ambience to relax, read a book even work on the computers that are provided there. It serves also like a work/study room.HHONORS: Late checkout upon availability, Free use of the Hiltonia Health Club, Local Newspaper and many more are only a few of the benefits a member can enjoy.THE HILTONIA CLUB: Unbelievably popular with locals because it has everything one could ask for, but unfortunately there are times when it becomes really noisy out there. I used it daily this time, talked with passionate members but I believe these members should learn to follow some rules. Equipment and facilities are of high standards but if there is such noise …I am really sorry!The Steam Bath, the Jacuzzi, the Sauna & Indoor Pool are the other facilities that I used extensively and they are excellent.From the long list of therapies I can recommend the Executive Massage. My therapist Elena managed to release all tension with her techniques and the result was amazing. Try it if you can afford this extra pampering.WI FI: It is free in all public areas including the outdoor pool area for all guests -not a fast connection though! It is free in for Hilton HHonors Gold and Diamond members only.WEDDING VENUES: The first and best hotel that is so popular with wedding venues in Nicosia. You see, weddings are a big social event in Cyprus and are inherent in the culture.In a nutshell, it was another memorable stay. If you want to pamper yourselves, do spend some days out here. Keep the good work up guys and thank you for making me feel like home.",The Landmark Nicosia

Very good rooms, excellent ammenities and very friendly and experienced people. Overall, a very good choice, perhaps a bit more overpriced than it should be.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,I can remember staying at this hotel back in 2000 and 2001. In 2013 the rooms seem to be renovated and meet all the demands properly. Very respectable environment with all facilities functioning as they should. The swimming-pool adds to the overall comfort. Free wi-fi quality must be improved though to keep up the status. Breakfast is good and in sufficient variety.,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Generally reliable services in this experienced hotel, however signs of ""tired & worn"" furniture and finishings indicate time for a much needed refurbishment. Food portions and quality are quite good, and the quietness in the rooms great for business conduct.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This is truly a top notch hotel for business and pleasure. Returning to this hotel regularly for the past 10 years, the service and facility has only improved. From check in to check out, the staff treats you with courtesy and respect. The pool is inviting and the spa is comfortable and well maintained. The restaurant is well appointed with delicious food, especially the rich buffet breakfast. Try for an executive room with a pool view.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Great Hotel and good facilities we have stayed on and off over the last 10 years. Good poolside bistro restaurant which is relaxed and varied menu. Great fitness club with good selection of exercise classes. A decent size pool 20 metres and very comfy sun loungers. Staff helpful and friendly,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"From the time you walk into the glorious lobby until the time you check out, this hotel makes you feel very special. Room service was the absolute best we have ever had. Food was plentiful and delicious. Staff made you feel welcome and appreciated. We rented a car and the gentleman helping us was outstanding. It doesn't get any better than the Hilton Cyprus. Since I am an animal rescuer it did my heart good to see the little black and white kitty being treated decent. She was not intrusive and I was delighted she was there. Thank you Hilton for understanding. BLessings to all.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"One of the two best business hotels in Cyprus' capital; the personnel is well trained and makes the stay quite comfortable. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. The location is not near the city's downtown but it provides all the necessary services required for a short stay (high-level restaurant, pool, gym, lounge bar, cafeteria, shops). It has a big parking lot with a gas station in it. It also has large areas for conferences and training.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I recently travelled over on business and stayed at the Hilton, very nice Hotel with good facilities, the food was great, especially buffet night. Would be good to also visit with family! Overall a nice experience and worth a visit!",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The hotel is located in a nice quiet area which is not far from the Turkish border. There was sufficient parking and car hire facility at the Hotel. On entry to hotel reception you get the impression of a hotel fit for celebrity stay. There are parts of the service and facilities at the hotel that are indeed first class but there are also parts of the service and facilities that are second and third class. I stayed at the hotel for 3 days with my family of wife and two kids. We stayed at their king room. Room was good but there wasn’t much of a view since the hotel is in the city. One thing I will remember this hotel for was its breakfast. Pure sweet orange juice straight from the fruit, lovely breakfast cupcake, and a great selection of breakfast goodies. In my two weeks expedition along the Mediterranean breakfast here beat all others. Unfortunately not all the staff were decent behaving individuals though. They seem to want to tell you what to do, even where to sit. So yes I had to put them in their place on a couple of occasions. We had dinner the first night of our stay by the pool and to be fair it was basic and we again we didn’t like the staff. So we choose to have dinner elsewhere for the rest of our stay.The Hotel is perhaps more ideal for business travel rather than holiday travel or expedition. It is not one to treat like a resort or similar sort. You will get bored very quickly. You need to have a plan for going out and about.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"It is actually the best thing you can find in accommodation in Nicosia. This and Hilton Park, however, this is more close to the city. The procedures are professional, however sometimes the personnel can be unhappy and not very polite. Never on the reception but sometimes in the bar or restaurant.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The hotel is very well locate only a few minutes away from the center of the capital city. There is enought parking space but during weekends hotel is booked for wedding events and if you go away late afternoon is difficult to find one after coming back! The room was lovely, spacious with a nice balcony facing the pool area! The bed was very comfortable and large enough. I love when i visit a hotel and they give you good quality of shampoo and shower gels. That is one of those hotels too! The only thing that we didnt like was the quality of food on room service. The food was average and took 30 minutes to arrive for a pizza and a ceasar salad. The prices of food for room service was not matching the quality standards of the food. Breakfast was nice with plenty of options on hot and cold dishes. I have to say that this is the best hotel around Nicosia area as we have tried all of them during business trips there....",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Hilton is the perfect choice for a hotel at Nicosia. Staff are friendly and professional,always available and happy to help you!Rooms are clean and tidy. Breakfast is very tasty and hotel's Fontana restaurant is good. Also lots of facilities are available and free to enjoy during your stay. Lastly hotel's hall is modern and well organised for lots of events. Good choice!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"The hotel itself is excellent, but the staff at the Hilton Cyprus is what makes this hotel a memorable place to stay. All are very friendly, attentive, and professional, and will do whatever they can to help and quickly resolve even the smallest issue. Rooms are well appointed and kept very clean by the housekeeping staff. The Fontana Restaurant is always a good choice, though my personal favorite is breakfast: the fresh orange juice is great first thing in the morning. The gym in the Club Hilonia has a plenty of equipment to get a good workout. Among the many reasons that I enjoy traveling to Cyprus, the Hilton is near the top of the list.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"If you are looking to stay in Nicosia, the Hilton is an excellent choice. Located on the main access route to central Nicosia and only 1km from the old walls, this Hotel has the most professional and friendly staff I have encountered. The hotel is particularly clean and the food is of a very high standard. We would definately stay in this hotel again.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Excellent welcoming experience, caring staff good value for money. Very convenient location for business. Need to check on arrival for any business centre requirements. The hotel is extremely clean and safe. Management team are always visible for any prompt decisions that may be need for guest requirements.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,Very nice hotel with outdoor swimming pool which is specially nice during summer months. Staff is very nice and helpful.You can find very good breakfasts (lot of fruits) but later on it is better to choose some restaurant in the city because food in hotel is overpriced. Lot of restaurant you can find on Ledra Street which 20 min walking distant from hotel.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,Excellent hotel all round. Reception helpful and provided outstanding assistance when required. Room very clean and a wonderful comfy bed. Breakfast really good. Can't recommend this hotel highly enough. Thank you for the wonderful stay.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We stayed for 2 nights in July 2013 at the Hilton in Nicosia. Combining an early booking deal with a standby upgrade we enjoyed for a very reasonable price the spaciousness of a Junior Suite and the use of the Executive Lounge. The friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff was what made the short stay very special. The facilities - pool, gym etc. are all top class. The hotel is close enough to walk to the vibrant old town. Highly recommended in every respect !",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"On a broad scale of things the tole would have probably rate somewhere between poor and average but given aternative options in Nicosia is is a solid 'very good' - obviously one would wonder why going to Nicosia for an overnight stay, but assuming your business brings you here (my case) or you have some twisted holidays destination, then Hilton is your place: quite oldish, decoration somewhere from late seventies to early eighties, choice of colors in the rooms made by a color-blind person but comfortable beds, large swimming pool and copious breakfest. Very central location so you do not even need a cab to reach most of places one would go to.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Upon arrival the thing that struck me the most was effective and efficient service provided at the lobby by the Hilton staff, providing a quick transition from taxi to lobby to room.Excellent room service, grea dining facilities and for me a superb sports and spa/relaxation facilities.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I've stayed three nights in this hotel, and it was worth every penny spend.Staff always available to your requests and most importantly with an excellent follow up after wards. The rooms are a bit outdated, however as they are perfectly clean and maintained, it didn't bother me at all. The essential was there.Another remarkable aspect was the human side of this hotel. Very smiley staff, and had all their attention on me rather than their PC screens or any other technology system that breaks the human interactions.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,I visited the hotel in May 2013. I think it is the biggest in Nicosia.It is safety and offers good restaurant.You can walk to the downtown and even to go to the Turkish area.Taxis are always available if you needed.Rooms are confortable.Very good fitness area and pool.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I have visited Hilton many times mostly for business purposes.This is the best you can find in Nicosia but the prices are very high and it needs renovation.The rooms (I usually get a double standard room) are small compared to the price but of a good quality. The business centre is small and the Internet access very expensive. For the price of the rooms the Internet access should be free.The breakfast is rich (try to sit outside around the pool), the pool is good and the pool bar good for a drink in the evening or a smoke.",The Landmark Nicosia

There was a balcony with a view too!We stayed in a standard double room.

40,A very nice hotel with friendly staff ensures a high quality stay. Will need some renovation in a not too distant future. Located a little out of the centre; you'll need transport. Very good for business. Nice fitness centre.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The hotel is nice. Located outside of the city centre. It takes about 5 minutes by taxi to get there. Rooms are large and bright. The hotel staff was on strike during my stay so there was no housekeeping (if you want fresh towels or other amenities you could take them from a trolley in the corridor, but don't expect they will clean and tidy the room!), no in-room dining, all restaurants were closed. There was a very poor basic breakfast only. No luggage staff. Staff was sitting in front of the main entrance waiting for talks with management... However, the remaining working staff were very friendly, polite and attentive. For the amount of service received during my stay it was greatly overpriced!",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I have spent many nights for professional reasons to this Hotel many years ago. It did not change a lot. Rooms are specious with nice balcony, breakfast is very good and rich, the outdoor swimming pool is very nice. The hotel is very good but at least 20 minutes walking from the city center. The prices probably are above average but it is Hilton.",The Landmark Nicosia

20,"Was excited to come to the no 1 hotel in Nicosia on tripadvisor, to find out all restaurants and pool bar are closed, breakfast is only continental, there are no housekeeping services and room service is non-existant.The greeting to the hotel was ""everyone is on strike, so we will have a few restrictions"". Which seems to mean we get a room to sleep in, no F&B facilities, room not cleaned - and I've only been here 24hrs!I understand that they are short staffed, and the handful of staff working are trying their best to keep the hotel running. But from a guest's point of view IT SHOULDN'T BE MY PROBLEM! I was not advised prior to arriving, was not offered any sort of compensation, or offered an alternate functional location (as stated they were doing on local news, just found out)However, I am not blaming the floor staff, who are working very hard, but the management, for letting this happen. They seem to be fine with the fact that their prestigious hotel is run like a 2 star one.I've stayed at Hilton hotels before and think their standard is excellent; however, this one has far from fulfilled my expectations.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This hotel was like stepping back into a decadent past, in an extremely good way. Their was an oldschool glamour exuding from the minute you pull up under the canopy.The details were well thought out, from the Rolex clocks showing the time all over the world, to the beautiful lounge, to the ostentatious lifts. It's always a good sign when the lifts are that beautiful.The staff were absolutely incredible, from the reception desk to the extremely thorough housekeeping.The gym facilities looked great and had I been able to afford anything in the frankly awe inspiring boutiques housed on the hotels ground floor promenade, I would have gladly ventured inside.I was lucky enough to stay at the hotel due to a business competition, at 216 euro a night I wouldn't yet be able to stretch to a stay there, being a student but I would definitely look to try to stay again in the future.Timeless, elegant and in the best possible taste.FYI The room wifi may say however many euro but it is now actually free :)Amazing time, amazing service, beautiful pool and the weather was gorgeous. Thoroughly recommended.",The Landmark Nicosia

They said that there was a fault but my guests had to have their dinner in a room of around 29C with their suits on. Not idealOther than that, food was great, organisation of the event was perfect",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Very nice hotel with a nice outdoor pool, good breakfast and nice rooms. The old part is rather old fashioned and could do with some renovation. The hotel has many festivities and is where all the celebrities stay, e.g. Last year Real Madrid was there during my stay. Wifi is only free in the lounge, otherwise extemely expensive (15 Euro per day). Service is very friendly.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We stayed there 3 nights and definitely enjoyed it. It is an old building but the rooms were recently renovated. The personnel is very helpful and friendly and the large swimming pool is a big plus. However the swimming pool gets rather crowded on the weekends and we had to wait for a sunbed to become free. In addition, wifi is free only in common places and costs 15 euro per day to have wifi in the room. I was expecting the hotel to cost less but I guess Cyprus is not as cheap as I thought.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I drove to the hotel, and managed to find a space in the overflow carpark at the top behind a small petrol station and taxi rank despite the barriers being up and the carpark indicator explaining it was full. The very friendly check-in staff explained this was okay and the parking was free. It would have been useful for a small A4 prinout sign to be placed near the payment machines to explain this as I did walk around for five minutes to try and establish how and if I should may.Check-in was swift, efficient and pleasant. The staff pointed out that my HHonours account number wasn't registered and would I like to join the scheme, as a member they swiftly added my number to the account, I guess it was protocol, but a useful heads up to ensure the points were added.The room was of a similar Hilton standard to most properties I've stayed in with the same expectations of comfort of a Hilton, especially the bed and thread count. Some people on TA mentioned it was tired in the room, it was not a modern refurb; but more than perfectly acceptable for the chains standard rooms.Breakfast was the standard Hilton fayre with the healthy option counter, again I really could not fault.The drinks were slightly more expensive at the bar (9.50 euro for a cocktail); however I decided to explore down town. It is a 30 minute walk or a 6-7euro taxi fare into the old town. There is actually a taxi rank office just up the small slope in front of the hotel entrance where the overflow carpark is, I'm sure the Hilton staff would also call one for you, I'm just a little more independent.I also had room service, at one point during my stay, again I couldn't fault, very nice food, good portions and excellent service.Wireless was expensive at 15 euro; however as the hotel management keeps pointing out to TA members making the point, it is about the same for the island. The free reception wireless is very poor, speeds and coverage are not the same as the paid for wireless. It would be nice to get wireless around the pool area at a good speed, but I am just a bit of a geek and should be doing some more laps.In my mind, a very much typical Hilton from experiences across Europe.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Hilton Cyprus is an excellent hotel for both business and leisure travellers. Well located in the center of the town and only 45 minutes from Larnaca International Airport. The staff is well trained and very willing to serve the guests. The executive rooms are large offering a balcony, sliding patio door windows and executive lounge access with free breakfast and refreshments. The conference rooms offer state-of-the-art technology and excellent internet connection. Wifi is free at the lobby, but you have to pay in the rooms....Wedding receptions around the pool are phantastic, as I had the opportunity to see one.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I stayed here for business for one week in early June. Staff were welcoming and my room on the 7th floor faced North towards the city with OK view. The hotel is aimed at business travellers and wealthy tourists. Facilities were OK and food was above average but not excellent. My comment related to how epensive it was to buy stuff in the hotel. 6 euros for a small bottle of water, 5 euros for a coffee and 7 euros for a beer. Easy to get to get to from airport and 20mins from town. Free self parking can be difficult if there are functions at the Hilton. Air conditioning very effective and needs to be very low during night or you'll freeze at night.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The hotel is still the best in town, the staff is very friendly and makes you feel welcome when you arrive. The executive lounge became not very exciting this time and the internet did not work. Breakfast was okay and the staff very friendly and helpful.",The Landmark Nicosia
20,"I was disappointed with this hotel compared with other Hilton hotels and give it 2.5 stars because:1. due to its location you really need a car - it is a good 20 mins walk from the edge of the city centre (slightly uphill) and public transport is not too frequent. The problem is that parking was often taken up by people visiting the hotel for meetings etc and finding a parking space was sometimes rather difficult - people were parking on double yellow lines at the entrance to the hotel on a busy road and it was not enforced and a number of spaces were reserved for taxis and a hire car company - all a bit chaotic really (minus 0.5 of a point for this).2. breakfast was not as good as my experience of excellent breakfasts in Hiltons elsewhere (Prague, Berlin...). The selection wasn't as extensive as other Hiltons and the service wasn't great - again it was a bit chaotic - it was only on the third morning that we were told that there were other choices which could be cooked fresh for us, staff didn't seem on the ball (asked for hot water and was given orange juice), and on one occasion came back from the buffet to find someone else at my table! (minus 0.5 of a point for this)3. it seems that guests have to fit around other people - the outdoor pool was closed early for functions and 3 out of the 4 times I tried to use the indoor pool I couldn't because an aqua-aerobics class came in and asked me to move out of the way! In my opinion, if facilities are provided for guests then they should have a reasonable expectation that they can use them. The facilities weren't great either - when I nosily looked to see what had been thrown on top of the lockers there was thick dirt, and shower gel was left to run out without being filled up (minus 0.5 of a point for this)4. on check-out I was presented with a bill for things I hadn't taken from the mini bar! When I contested this I got quite a frosty reaction from the clerk and it all felt rather uncomfortable (minus 0.5 of a point for this).5. expensive in-room WiFi. Come on Hilton, it's the 21st Century! Why do guests have to pay €15 for internet access in their rooms when it is free in the reception area? Isn't it time you made WiFi available freely for everyone? (minus 0.5 of a point for this)Before I went I saw lots of reviews saying that rooms were tired etc and needed redecorating. Yes they are old fashioned but I can't say I was that bothered - my room was clean and comfortable, there was a kettle (albeit refills of milk etc were hit and miss) and a mini bar / fridge to keep drinks cold. The only issue was lots of noise from doors banging etc but my room was near the lifts so it might have been due to high traffic. The ground floor area was nice, looks like it has been recently refurbished, and the outdoor pool area is pleasant and a good place to sit outdoors.There's not an awful lot in the local area but there is a shopping centre with a supermarket, fast food restaurants, clothes shops etc about five minutes' drive to the south, and the town centre is about five minutes' drive to the north for shops, restaurants, sightseeing.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Very comfortable; Very Clean; Very Friendly and Very Considerate to all a guests needs. Only slight moan (and it is against hotels in general, not just Hilton) ... Bar drinks were expensive, and this becomes extra obvious when the on-site super market sells cans of soft drink for 1.3 Euros, and yet the bar charges 6 Euros.",The Landmark Nicosia

The good news about that is they have free parking and it isn't a terribly long walk to the walled city.The rooms are a little on the older side, but the bedding was fresh and clean. The room was a decent size for Europe with a large King sized bed.I had a chance to use the workout room which was perfectly fine. We also ate in the restaurant both for dinner and breakfast the next morning.

The coffee shop was okay but service was slow. The menu was basic and average at best. The hotel is run down and very tired it is desperate need of refurbishment. The branding is probably wrong it would be a very good 3 star hotel but falls well short of Hilton brand. The staff wre generally okay but my general feeling was the staff were not interested. It is well placed, the location in Nicosia being convenient but I will still be looking to go elsewhere next time.",The Landmark Nicosia

It was very pleasant to speak portuguese with the receptionist. Congratulations!! But I think the rooms need a urgent reform. The room is very old fashioned and not so comfortable. It was just for one night but I was disappointed with the Hilton Brand and its quality in Cyprus.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I visited the Hilton Cyprus during a medical conference. It's a huge hotel with a pool and a bug lobby. In general the staff is kind and helpful, the premises are clean and luxurious and the pool is quite big for your swimming adventures!The breakfast area (as well as the restaurant and coffee shop) are sufficient with good food but many of the waiters don't know well english nor greek.... The rooms are good but old. The window frame was quite old and didn't keep the sounds away from the highway while closed. The wifi is not free in the rooms -and quite expensive- and the view from the rooms is not nice. I had a pool view room, but except the pool, it was viewing also the terraces of the low level premises of the hotel, which the hotel should have cover with grass or flowers or even tiles to avoid that ugly sight.The parking lot and the entrance of the hotel needs fixing also. It was swarming with cars and one of them was parked literally on the nice roundabout infront of the main entrance creating an ugly and frustrating image.The hotel also should advise and check the taxi drivers coming there. I used one taxi and he didn't give me any receipt nor used the taxi meter and left me 300 m away from the point that asked him to leave me. I informed the hotel and except the general advise, didn't seem eager to look into that matter.The shops inside the hotel were nice and luxurious. The distance from the city center is aprox. 2km and you need to take a bus or a taxi especialy in the hot summer months.Overall experience was good and if the hotel decides to rennovate its self certainly it would be one of the best...",The Landmark Nicosia

50,The Cyprus Hilton is situated in the heart of Nicosia which is very good if you are traveling on business. The hotel staff are very friendly and are willing to assist you.The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The gym and health center could do with a 'face lift' however. Breakfast and the food is of good quality.The Hilton is a traditional hotel in the center of town and is good for business or family trips to Nicosia either for work or shopping in town.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The Hilton Cyprus is located some 5-10 min. drive from the city center, along the main road coming in from Larnaca airport. hence in the direct vicinity of the hotel there are not many sights, restaurants or shops. That said, there are not many quality hotels in the city center. But the hotel is nice: good rooms, swimming pool etc. The rooms are slightly tired but clean. The food in the restaurants is tasty but not the special quality you might expect in this level of hotel. The price of hotels in Nicosia is surprisingly high and the Hilton is no exception, but you can find good deals online sometimes.The biggest downside of the hotel is the ridiculously expensive price for internet access in the room, although it is free in the reception area.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Very spacious rooms, mine was overlooking the pool area, interior a bit outdated. Hotel staff is very helpful, friendly and nice.The gym was a bit disappointing, it is an ""public"" health club and machines were old and often it was quite crowded. The sauna/swimming pool is functional but don't expect anything fancy. The food in the restaurant was decent, but the overall atmosphere in the restaurant was a bit lacking.. Breakfast buffet is large and includes healthy options.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"This was a first stay in Cyprus. We are Hilton Honors Club members so are familiar with the chain. This is a well run hotel; we were most impressed by the very friendly and helpful service, from the people at the front desk to the personnel in the Executive Lounge. The bedding was very comfortable; fluffy pillows that you can sink into. Sound insulation for the room, however, was dissappointing (we could hear the high volume of the tv next door). The food was standard fare for a hotel of this caliber; nothing exceptional. The healthclub was clean and the separate mens and womens jacuzi and sauna facilties were great. i recommend taking a class (I did pilates) even if you don't understand a word of Greek - it's an experience! If you want to go to the healthclub and the indoor pool in your bathrobe, ask for a room at that side of the building (be aware though that this side does not offer a great view so ask for a room that faces the outdoor pool). Overall, this is a very nice hotel for a business trip - what you would expect from a higher-end Hilton Hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Quality of service at the Reception desk needs improvement for sure. Takes time to pay your bill at check out and there is not a bill in advance delivered in your room.Also at ""traffic"" time, especialy in the evenings waiting in the hotel lobby to be served is a challenge. Headcount reduction? cost savings? who knows.However that fact that the hotel is located within the business and commercial areas of the city compensates the ones who travel for business purposes.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Room was fine though the air conditioning was not on or operable. Housekeeping brought me a fan which was adequate when leaving the door open but I had issues feeling secure, particularly with the civil unrest that was prevailing. Food overall was decent, nothing spectacular but mostly because some of it was different from what I was accustomed to being from a different country. One individual manning the desk, an older gentleman, was especially helpful, even accompanied me to my room to resolve a problem experienced with the internet service. Went way out of his way to accommodate and assist. Laundry service is quite expensive even for a hotel, three shirts and two pair of pants laundered for over $100 American. Security was very relaxed which I would characterize as unfortunate in light of the banking crisis that was ensuing, demonstrations and marching. Overall, the Greek people at this hotel were very convivial especially the males. The ladies seemed a bit flustered and disorganized overall but were all pleasant.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed here for one night on a business trip. It's pretty much what you'd expect from an upscale Hilton: comfortable, good sleep quality, efficient staff, and so on. It has a nice pool. Thankfully the air conditioning was extremely efficient: it needed to be when the outside temperature was 30C! Rooms also have a small balcony which is brilliant if you smoke. Breakfast was, as ever, a bit of a disappointment. All-in-all, recommended for a business trip, but not sure I'd necessarily want to stay here for a romantic weekend: I'm sure that Nicosia has plenty of charming hotels with character.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"My husband and I will always try to stay in places where there is a Hilton as we want a certain level of service and quality guaranteed, and the Hilton Cyprus did not disappoint, they totally surpassed our requirements.We stayed in a King Executive room, which is always worth the small surcharge. The room was very spacious and kept spotlessly clean. It has a very high level of specification, with everything you need for a relaxing stay.Apart from breakfast, we ate in the Fontana restaurant most nights of our stay, and we couldn't praise it highly enough, not just for the quality but also for the value for money. The only problem we had was that the al a carte meals were so generously proportioned, that we never had room for desert.All the staff were very welcoming and helpful, and made you feel like nothing was too much trouble.There is only one point that was annoying that we would like to raise, that we had difficulty parking on many occasions due to the number of parking spaces being taken by non residents who were coming to use the gym, so we think that a certain number of spaces should be reserved for residents only.We would highly recommend anyone consider staying at the Hilton Cyprus, as it is perfectly placed for business or pleasure.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Had a lovely experience here. Seeing I was tired on arrival for a week of work meetings, the staff upgraded me to an amazing room, which was very spacious and had a great view. Room was spotless and very comfy. Staff were always really lovely. Great fitness centre, but not always open (late to open a couple of mornings, which made getting to meetings a bit stressful). Amazing pool. Breakfast buffet definitely one of the best I've ever had, wonderful fresh food, lots of healthy and vegetarian options, even soy milk! Location is not great but you can walk to the old town in about twenty minutes from memory. If you need wifi be careful, as prices can be exorbitant if you let the hours add up.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,Well placed hotel with all you would expect from this chain. Decent room and decent breakfast and the staff are good. Plenty of parking and well placed to get out of Nicosia if you have hired a car. Even by Nicosia standards though it is expensive.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Booked King Club lounge access for three nights off season. Room was full of an incinerator smell.Although extremely tired after a snow delay at LHR. We had to move rooms during the night. During that move the corridors were full of the smelt smell. Eventual room was number 561 on the end overlooking the tennis courts. A little better.Exec lounge was poor. Never staffed. No breakfast option there. One bottle of red wine left at 6pm with nibbles and not topped up. Never enough glasses, cups, t bags etc etc. afternoon treats and evening capes were presented under cling film and then left to run out dry out. No service or staff assistance for concierge or even just conversation!Main breakfast team were highlight. Good food , fresh juices and great staff.Pool area was clean, although you would have to ask for a lounger or chair and towel. It was all stored cleared away. No water on even to wash you hands outside toilets.signs saying not to use Poole etc.No one offered to get luggage on departure, not until transfer car was there and a tip could be had.We would not choose the hotel again. There is nothing around or close to hotel so bus and taxi needed to get into town.Nicosia was quite run down you had to really research for the culture.Easily accessible to North side, just need ID.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"A nice, bright and pleasant hotel with everything the business traveller could need.Service was generally good although trying to check in three guests at once did lack the personal touch!My main complaint was the food with some limited choices on a Sunday evening. Menu seemed to focus on fries with everything. Had a Sunday evening meal including baked cheese and a lunch including grilled Halloumi but in both cases the cheese was cold! Did talk to the restaurant manager about this but only got a shrug or the offer of more (cold?) cheese.Breakfast was good - particularly liked the juicing machine and the guarantee of very fresh orange juice!",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"I spent 3 amazing nights at the Hilton on a business trip and I was here again in 2011. Even though it is an old Hotel, it has never -Not even for once lost its high standards and goals. It continuous to be the perfect meeting point for the business clientele, and for the last 45 consecutive years it stands as a symbol of exclusivity and a luxurious landmark in the City of Nicosia.As always I read reviews before I make any booking and I found it the 2nd most popular –but this of course does not mean much because popularity does not go with quality or luxury. You see, there are times when budget hotels with less stars are more popular to tourists for one or another reason. Anyway, the Hilton won a 2013 Traveller’s Choice Award in the category of Top 25 Luxury Hotels in Cyprus and this is a fact!!I won’t exaggerate writing that I was spoiled and pampered again like the previous time I was here because it is indeed a hotel that spoils and pampers its guests.STAFF: They are all exceptional and very attentive. I need to write though about Maria the Housekeeping supervisor who deserves a special mention. When she saw me desperate and disappointed that I did not have a bathing suite along and for 3 days I would miss Jacuzzi and the interior pool in minutes she came up with a solution. She was unceasingly friendly and helpful on other times as well when I needed her.Elena Oltu –housekeeper who was decorating my room! There was a different surprise from her even late in the afternoons when she would drop by again for more! Her amazing decorating creations were better than any other I had seen for years. But of course there was Mrs. Christina Spyrou and Sophie, the other ladies who were just as good and always polite. Stelios, the mini bar attendant always discreet when he knocked on the door to ask if I needed anything from the mini bar. In all, I felt like home with their unparalleled level of excellent service.ROOM: This time I had the executive room #361, overlooking the road. The double-glazed windows keep the traffic noise away. The guest is made welcome by a note on the flat TV –a nice gesture! Spacious like all rooms of the executive wing and spotlessly clean, which for me is factor #1. The executive suites have a minimalistic style and a touch of luxury. How can it be otherwise ….soft relaxing clours, a huge very comfortable bed with cushions on, beautifully designed curtains matching with the carpet and walls, a huge desk something missing many times from other business hotels. The businessman can work out here in comfort and eloquent silence in the amazing ambience of his room. Functional amenities for demanding guests!Coffee/tea facilities, fresh flowers in the room and bathroom, safe, mini bar, iron board, robe and slippers are provided.Remember to have the chain behind the door just in case somebody accidentally comes in. Sometimes you might not hear the knock and the staff thinks that nobody is in and they gate-crash inside.The Nicosia Hilton knows well how to pamper its guests with some VIP courtesies upon arrival and throughout the stay. It is something a pleasant surprise each day.I had a big bowl of seasonal fruit, sweet Cypriot delicacies, snacks, mineral water and wine. If this is not a real treat and pampering, then what!!BATHROOM: Tiled walls and floor with a marbled sink. Spacious/spotlessly clean/magnifying mirror and ample of nicely scented towels for hands/face and body.The water pressure in the shower is not what I expected especially when I came from a hotel where water had a strong pressure but of course I can understand it. You see this is due to the Eco friendly sustainability initiatives ….it would be actually nice to see other hotels practicing these measures also.I loved the new toiletries which are by far better than the ones the Hilton had for years. They are the Peter Thomas Roth from the Mega-rich collection. I found them simply amazing and they smell like fresh tangerines! The body wash gel contains green and yellow micro beads with vitamins. Indeed a treat to guests!BREAKFAST: The first meal of the day (American) at the Fontana Restaurant is sumptuous! It is breakfast for a diverse group of members as well as guests, so there is everything for everyone enough to fill you up till dinner -a paradise of cereals and dry fruit. There is a choice of home-made bread/cakes/rolls/croissant/muffing/jam/marmalade and honey, and omelettes. There is of course so much more. Be sure to taste the Chef’s homemade muffins –they are huge and of excellent taste. Breakfast is under the supervision of professional staff one of which is Christina who is supervising the restaurant in the morning. I found her alert and impeccable.DINING: The Fontana interior is fabulous creating a warm and pleasant ambience. Besides the wide variety of traditional and international buffets, it offers the a la carte menu where guests can choose out of a variety of Signature dishes that suite all tastes. The Chef of the Cuisine Mr. Georgiou is very talented with several awards in his record. There is something for everyone, from the Hilton’s classics to vegetarian dishes, nutrient salads and different other health options.I had the Sea Bass from the a la carte menu –it was cooked to perfection and the portion was huge and very tasty! There are amazing salads to accompany meals and if I had to give just one word for dessert….I would say “heavenly” !! Of course there is Christos, the Food & Beverage Co-ordinator who is the appropriate person to recommend the matching wine or drink to accompany your dish.EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: Guests with rooms on the Executive floor have access to this lounge. Beautifully decorated with fitted carpets, comfortable sofas, -serves like a library, a study/work room as it provides 2 or 3 laptops as well. It provides coffee/tea facilities, cool drinks, some wine, snacks and nibbles. There are tables for dining, and guests are able to bring additional persons to this lounge if they wish, whereby they then have the option to be charged 25 euros p.p., which allows their guest(s) unlimited food and beverage or if preferable, to be charged on a consumption basis. Of course don’t expect a full menu, mostly snacks and three or four kinds of dessert.SPA: The Spa is great here at the Hilton -Excellent facilities, personal attention, in hands of expert consultants. Ask to see the list of therapies and choose the one that suits you out of the body and face treatments. A basic 60 min mineral face treatment costs 75 euros, with the most expensive –the Anti-Aging 90 min for 110.The classic back massage is the cheapest (30 min) for 50 euros, with the most expensive –the International Thai Massage (90 min) for 120 euros.Guests who stay in the hotel can use the Jacuzzi, Steam bath and Sauna without paying any extras. IWi Fi: Internet is free in all public areas and food beverage outlets, but guests can have access in their rooms under a small charge although I found it kind of slow to be honest.The cost is 15 euros for 24 hours and 45 euros for 72.It is free though and it has become a standard benefit for the HHonors Gold and Diamond members staying at all Hilton worldwide properties.LOCATION: It is a hotel geared predominantly to the business clientele making it an ideal meeting point, with just 15 minutes’ walk to Nicosia’s highest points.Transport: Buses 116, 158, 160 can get you to the main bus station -at Solono’s Square for just a euro. Buses are scarce during weekends though!Use the Intercity (green) buses if you wish to get as far as Larnaca, Limassol or Paphos. There is a bus stop approximately 100 metres from the hotel on the right.If you are fit, it is a matter of 15 minute walk to the City centre otherwise take a taxi for 6 euros. Find them behind the parking lot.PLACES OF INTEREST: The Cyprus Archaeological Museum should come first on your list of priorities.This time I visited the Folk Museum and I found it very interesting. A visit to Makarios Cultural Foundation, Laiki Yitonia and the House of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios are also highly recommended. Finally get to the Old city -Ledra Street is full of retail Shops, Café bars, Restaurants and Malls, making it so it an interesting area to go for a walk.LEDRA’S CROSSING POINTt: If you wish to pass through the opposite side –the Turkish side, you can have access through Ledra’s passing point. By all means it is a passing point and not a boarder because boarders divide countries. Cyprus is a country on its whole, with its northern part being occupied by the Turkish troops since 1974 with the Turkish invasion. Be sure to have your passports along. The situation is sad here, and I am sure there is not much that would keep you on the Turkish side. Go for it if you want to, just to say that you did.CONCLUSION: In all after my 3 night stay here I believe it justly ranks first on the charts. Check for early booking and enjoy some amazing discounts.I can’t wait to be back. Thank you guys you are all wonderful!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Hilton is not well located for a tourist maybe because of its distance to the city center, but its ideally located in case of a business trip. Spacious and very clean rooms with whatever necessary and a very nice indoor restaurant. Extremely polite staff and really helpful.

40,"I have spent couple of days on Jan. 2013 in a business trip. This is my second time I spent in the hotel. I like the hotel as it is very clean and well decorated. The room as spacious and all the facilities requires: TV, kettle, safe box, fridge, iron and cabinet, drawers, and an office. The room is also very clean and spacious, it has all the toiletries needed except the cotton bud. The rooms come with a balcony mine was overlooking the park (room 419), however rooms with even numbers like 420 their balcony overlook the swimming pool. The receptionists are very friendly, as well as all the staffs in the hotel. The breakfast was gorgeous with many varieties including fruits, pastries, eggs, omelet, honey, cheeses, salads and cereals, in addition to water, juices, and fresh lemon juice.The only drawback was the internet which was not free in the guest room; it costs 6 euro per hour or 16 euro per day. However, it is free in public area and required to sign in.The hotel is not in the city center but you can reach the old city 15 minutes walking or by a taxi for 6 Euros. Next to the hotel there are many shops with high brands such as Guess, Channel, Juicy Cotture, etc.. Pharmacies, and bakeries are reachable by a walking distance from the hotel.Note that I have booked the hotel early and got 40% discount. So the price was very attractive.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed in Marriott Cyprus as there is no Marriott and only HolidyaInn seems to be way below expectations (judging by TripAdvisor reviews).The hotel is OK, interior is bit dated but clean and well kept.The only nuisance is parking - overcrowded and way to small for guests. If you add groups of taxi drivers who occupy guests' spaces and cars parked in random order and every angle of each corner (including spaces intended for disabled) you got full picture.Now to personal touch ... I found it irritating that hotels would force on you all those ""fantastic"" entertainment applications on hotel TVs. Unfortunately no exception here ... additionally all HDMI inputs were locked by some smart software. I went to the reception and politely requested TV I can use for my media player - not like I expected much help but ... after two days additional TV (with unlocked HDMI) landed in my room. Nice :)",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We, two couples, spent a week at the Hilton Cyprus just before Christmas 2012. We decided on Cyprus and Nicosia to get some warmth and sun, good food, and see interesting historic places. We decided on the Hilton because of it had reasonable winter prices and seemed a good ""home base"" for visiting Nicosia and the rest of the island.Some of this worked out very well.We stayed in Executive Rooms looking toward the pool and used the Executive Lounge daily. The rooms were nicely furnished and provided all the amenities expected from a upper level Hilton. The hotel grounds are well maintained and attractive. The outside pool, though open, wasn't used during our week since it was cool and rainy all week. The Hilton has wonderful and helpful staff. Maria, at the front desk, deserves a special mention for us because of her unceasingly friendly and helpful acts along with with problem solving skills.We assumed there would be real tour buses available for us tourists to see the numerous sights around the island since we didn't want to drive. Unfortunately, at least during the winter months, that's not the case. We did use a service of a tour guide one day for an informative trip to Paphos and Limassol. Though the guide was good, the four of us were crammed into a Nissan for 8 hours. We decided to avoid that experience again. So, we spent some of each of the other six days in Nicosia. We took a taxi in daily and wandered around. Unfortunately, there's not a week's worth of things to see, eat and/or do in Nicosia on rainy December days.The Hilton helped us through the problem. During our fairly frequent down times, we used their available services. We had massages, swam in the indoor pool, got hair styling and wandered through the small local shops. The interior seating in the lobby area provided a comfortable place for sitting and talking. Except for the one evening a large Russian crowd quickly drank all the booze and emptied the appetizers, the quiet Executive Lounge served as our ""living room"" with drinks and appetizers freely available before we went down to dinner.My complaint with high end Hilton hotels (world-wide) is their consistent high charges for internet services, 15 Euro daily. Many European hotels are getting more computer friendly and charging little or nothing, but Hilton hasn't budged. Breakfast was included in our room price and it was very nice. There were plenty of options, though they couldn't make a decent hollandaise for eggs benedict, the plain scrambled eggs on the breakfast bar, were superb. An English breakfast was available at the bar along with a variety of breakfast items. I ate a lunch buffet one day but learned that, unlike the dinner buffet, you're charged much more if you get something from the cold and warm side of the buffet. There's a separate charge for dessert and it's per person. We ate the dinner buffet one night, but found ordering off the menu was a better experience. Dinner and breakfast service, like the other areas of the hotel was superb. There wasn't a server who wasn't friendly and efficient.You can not beat the experience of the Hilton Cyprus in the Nicosia area. It was spotless and service was grand. We appreciated them immensely.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Firstly an explanation of why we went to the Hilton. We tried to book a package tour of North and South Cyprus, but the tour company without reason cancelled the January departure. We decided to do the tour independently using Expedia for the travel/hotel package, which was just ONE QUARTER the cost of the package trip.We flew to Larnaka from Gatwick,and took the Shuttle Bus (8 euros pp) to Nicosia. The Shuttle bus stops outside the city. IT IS NOT WALKABLE IN THE DARK- so we took a taxi (7 euros) to the Hilton.The following were 5 star:a) Reception -Andreas very helpful and later arranged an excellent taxi trip to North Cyprus- Kyrenia & Bellapaisb) Our room -King Hilton Guestroom on 7th.floor overlooking pool -clean, well-stocked, very comfortable bed.c) Facilitiesd)Sumptuous layoute) Extremely helpful cashier Phediasc who in true spirit of customer care sorted out a problem with our bill- he is an asset to hotel.So what reduces its star rating in our opinion:1. Breakfast at 20.5 euros is expensive. This can be reduced by buying breakfast vouchers to 15 euros- but BEWARE if you buy these you are expected to have breakfast every day. We had breakfast the first day but the hot food was ONLY LUKE WARM-not pleasant. We drew this to the attention of the restaurant staff and to reception. We did not return.2.The hotel is 2 km outside the city. All other 5 star hotels in such a situation provide a free shuttle bus to/from the city. This Hilton does not, possibly because a lot of their clients have cars, can afford the 7-10 euro taxi fare, or if thrifty take the 1 euro bus ride- OK in week but very sparce at weekends (Buses 116,158,160 go to main bus station at Solomonos Square).Use the INTERCITY buses from here -very cheap- buy ONE DAY ticket = return. We used them for trips to Limassol, Pathos and Larnaka. Buses were on time and comfortable.",The Landmark Nicosia

The only grizzle which I know is a little selfish, is that all the leisure club was closed on January 1st.

The executive lounge has some food, not really a full breakfast, and certainly a poor dinner.What really bothered me was that I had a colleague join me in the executive lounge for a meeting and they charged 25 euros for that privilege!

30,"I stayed at this hotel as part if a conference in the nearby Filixenia Cyprus EU Presidency 2012. The hotel is well located and the rooms are very acceptable with a high standard of offerings and good TV service etc. The balcony on my room, looking out to the front was also a good size and a nice feature. I had two problems both if which were small but deeply annoying!! One was pricing of wifi and wine. The wifi cost €6 per accumulated hour. It worked and was a good speed but a hotel like that, in the present day and age, should be free. The wine was €30-40 in the bar and restaurant for a basic bottle of local wine. They should be able to sell it for half of that. The second problem was breakfast. Though the food and range was excellent, the food from most of the 'hot' containers was just about stone cold on both of my mornings. Go to Frajolini cafe snack bar 10 minutes walk up the road where you can get free wifi, friendly local staff and two breast if chicken burgers, two chips and 4 beers for a total of €20.00!!",The Landmark Nicosia

Whilst the rooms are comfortable enough they really could do with some updating, particularly in the bathrooms. The foyer area is very nice.Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and generally service is also very good. I also ate in the lobby bar one evening, which was just ok and quite expensive. The location isn't all that inspiring or central but suited my purposes.All in all I would stay again but I reckon the Hilton Cyprus is closer to a good 4 star.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"I have been in this hotel several times and I found it one of the best in the Nicisia, specially the buffet of breakfast in the morning can make your day with a very good range of selection as you expect in Hilton, the most important point about this hotel is very polite,nice and welcoming staff who works in the restaurant and they try their best to make you satisfied, Minibar in the room is very complete but costly likewise room service and restaurant, the hotel have good swimming pool and the gym.if you can afford the price I can recommend this hotel to you but keep in mind it's a bit far from city center of Nicosia and where you can have more fun, taxi is always available which costs about 6-10 Euros for going to some other good places in Nicosia , don't miss breakfast in this hotel and ask for room in higher floor with the pool view.you have yes and coffee on your room as well.",The Landmark Nicosia

Good hotel, confortable rooms, good TV programs choice ( not TVE!).Varied breakfast, inside and outside restaurant.Very nice and friwndly staff.Not in the city center ( 25 minutes walk or € 5-€7 taxi ride)On the negative side: very expensive cafeteria and bar ( coffee €5.5) very expensive minibar, and very expensive wifi access.",The Landmark Nicosia

The breakfast was brilliant, with my favourite: fresh orange juice!The room was splendid, the swimming pool well kept.Lots of services, hairdresser, newsagent, all very friendly and customer oriented.The parking was still free, but it looks like they're going to make it chargeable.I would definitely return!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I have been staying twice at the Hilton Cyprus during the last month and I enjoyed my stays very much. The Hilton Cyprus is a big hotel, but it has character.The two times I was there I had one of the renovated rooms towards the back of the building. No noise at all.The outdoor pool is great, even for swimming laps in the morning before breakfast. The indoor pool is nice, too, but too small for swimming laps. I went to the gym regularly, you have everything you need there.Breakfast is great, in September you could have it outside, too, I understand it is too hot for doing so in July or August.The hotel is walking distance to he walled city center, about 20 min. Otherwise you can take a taxi, about 6€ to Ledras, or a bus, 1€.I found all of the staff extremely pleasant, helpful and professional, from the reception to the restaurant/breakfast and maids. The only exception was the executive lounge. I had access to it with the type of room I was booked in, and, compared to other Hilton hotels where I had enjoyed the privilege of lounge access a lot, I must say you do not really feel completely welcome there. But that's about the only not completely positive thing I have to say about the Hilton Cyprus.",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"Just a Hilton, with nice rooms, spacious, clean and comfortable, adequate beds, good layout, calmness. But the bathrooms are not at the level of a 5- star hotel of today, quite small and basic. Another thing of last century, WiFi is ridiculously expensive and very slow, not to speak of the old machines at the so-called business center. Breakfast is rather less varied and rich than in other Hilton's.Staff is correct. Nice swimming-pools.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I come periodically and stay for about three days. Now the improvements are finished- about- its much nicer updated than it was. The pool is great, good amenities and food and drinks, but this hotel is in the middle of Nicosia and not for relaxation with the family. The rooms are fresh and bathrooms great.The staff in the common parts are quick to take and make your fist order, then they sort of forget you. Parking cars here is not the best idea, its better to use taxis and fix their prices beforehand through the hotel. Dont be intimidated when the drivers ask for you to pay extra, or deliberately 'get lost' . Dont ask for directions, get people to come to you if possible. Smoking by the pool area is OK. Food and drinks are very good, but the restaurants out are all worth a visit for variety and good quality.",The Landmark Nicosia

My partner has been before and went since with his mum and aunt. His mum has walking difficulties and the staff were very welcoming and attentive.Most of the stafff were really lovely and the two that weren't may just had a bad day! There was only one little incident as when we returned from the pool, we were locked out of our room. The key card didn't work anymore and my partner had to go to reception in his dressing gown while I was standing around on the corridor. Otherwise all did run very well.We are going again in less than four weeks and I can't wait to relax after a very difficult year. I hope we will have just as good of a time as last year.

"" lol because this Hilton in Nicosia really is so nice and the breakfast was well let me just say mmm mmmmmmmmm and the staff were so helpfull and polite making this one night stay prob the best hotel we have ever stayed at !Well done Hilton and we give this a 5+++++ rating .

40,"This was my first stay in a Hilton hotel and on the whole it lived up to all my expectations. The service was consistently excellent, from our arrival at 2.30am after a delayed flight and personal note from the manager checking we had arrived ok (in response to our email to Hilton informing them of our expected late arrival).I was staying at the Hilton for a conference at the University of Cyprus, and the proximity to the university could not have been better - a 5-10 minute walk. The distance to Nicosia however is a bit more - about a 30 minute walk. This is not a problem, as the hotel is located in a nice area, in the business district and the distance from the town means it is fairly quiet, with lots of space around the pool, and parking. It's an easy walk into town, but more than the advertised 15 minutes. There is no shortage of taxis in the town, and a taxi bell at the hotel, so it is easy and inexpensive to get to the centre.There is a good choice of restaraunts, a pool with loungers and towels, and the rooms are comfortable and clean. My only criticism would be the lack of free wifi, if not in the bedrooms then at least in the bar areas. For those of us who can't charge internet costs back to work, some free wifi access would have been appreciated!It's an ideal hotel for business, or for anyone attending the university and I'd happily stay again.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"We attended two wedding events over the weekend and unfortunately I have to say that in general the food was a disappointment. The cocktail reception was held in a room to small for the number of people and the air-conditioning was almost non-existant. The nibbles were something I could have made at home and knowing the price that was charged for this event it was unacceptable! The drinks however were very nice.We then attended the dinner which was reasonably good for a buffet however I did choke on a salmon bone that caused me to go to the washrooms in order to remove it. Much more care should be taken in both cases, it is the Hilton after all.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I was there for two nights at the hotel was beautiful, excellent spa and a delicious breakfastService is very good",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"In Nicosia, I usually stay at the Hilton Park, which I have reviewed -- I said there weren't any really good hotels in Nicosia and, although the first tier wasn't as good as it would be in other cities, it's good enough and the Hilton Park is in it. On this trip, I decided I wanted a change, and especially the possibility of a better breakfast, and so I tried the Hilton. It is better than the Hilton Park, but it's also quite a lot more expensive and the question is: is the improvement in facilities worth the extra money?I can't quite make up my mind. Service here is good, but so it is in the Hilton Park. The rooms here are a little better, the breakfasts are quite a lot better, the bar is marginally better and there is a choice of restaurants, which the Hilton Park does not have. I didn't eat in any of them, though, so I can't comment on quality.With one exception, the staff are friendly and helpful. I decided to ignore the one exception -- an older man (about my age, in fact), who responded to my request to extend my stay by an extra night in a way that astonished me. Okay, they were full, but a simple ""I'm terribly sorry, I wish I could help but I'm afraid we're full"" would have been fine. I did not expect to be treated as though I'd asked him to pimp his granddaughter. I think, though, that that is simply his manner and I'd guess he's senior enough that -- although they must be aware that he is no PR man for Hilton -- no-one feels able to retire him.I'm left with the question I started with -- is it worth the extra money? -- and I still don't know. But I have to go back to Cyprus shortly and the fact is that I'll probably choose the Hilton again. So I suppose I must think it is. Just.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We had a 5 night stay in July 2012 whilst my girlfriend presented at an international academic conference at the university nearby. The hotel is situated not far from the centre of town, just off one of the main streets into the centre. We checked in at 3am after a flight from the UK, all was well, our room was ready for us, the night checkin was straightforward and quick. Our room was a good size with a balcony overlooking the parking lot and entrance. The room had climate control, a must when outside temperatures were in the high 30s Celsius.There is a variety of bars and restaurants in the hotel, we used a couple which were typical of any international hotel, quite expensive but great service from the waiting staff and a good choice of drinks.There is a lovely swimming pool, ideal to cool down, and sun loungers around it. The lifeguards and pool attendants who gave out towels for the pool were again friendly and helpful.The hotel is a fair walk from the old town, around 30 minutes, which in the intense heat can be tiring, the good news is that taxis are plentiful and cheap, around 6 euros during the day and 7 at night. There is a bell just outside the front entrance to call a taxi and they appear very quickly.The reception and porters were very helpful.A nice stay in a great hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Excellent service!! Profeesionals and at the same timefriendly approach.The breakfast is superb; the atmsosphere in the pool bar is very relaxing; we have organised a business meeting followed by a corporate presentation and then dinner offered to approximately 65 guests (out top business partners in Cyprus) and everything went smoothly & nice; perfect evening!!,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Stayed at the Hilton for one night end of June 2012. The Hilton is located at the heart of Nicosia. Excellent location.The rooms are really clean and of high luxury. They need a serious renovation though since they look quite old and heavy. When staying there you dont really bother to look at the old doors or the dated carpet floor since the rooms is offering everything you need.Breakfadt was included in the room price but it was nowhere near to a 5star luxury hotel. Had better breakfasts at 4star hotels many times. Comparing it to other 5* hotels it feels really poor.In any case the breakfast is usually included in the room price so take advantage of it.I have been a member of the hiltonia fitness club for the last 3 years so i can write a couple of things on that also. The outside pool is just perfect. Great atmosphere, calmness even on summer Sundays that gets a bit crouded. The inside underground pool is really small though and not always at a good temperature during winter. Thr gym is quite good. A bit crowded from locals that are members of the fitness club so dont expect easy access to all the facilities at all times.The outside pool bar serves great coffees, coctails, juices but a bit pricey. Not much compared to coffee shops in Nicosia and Limassol.The serious problem is when it comes to dining at the pool bar-restaurant or even ordering food to eat on you sunbed.The prices are close to 2 Michelin Star restaurants in France or Spain. Just unacceptable to serve pool bar food on plastic tables and sunbeds and charging it double the price of good restaurants or bar-restaurants in Nicosia or Limassol. Never eaten there and not planning to.Overall the Hilton Cyprus is a really good experience. Pricey but good. Certainly not value for money.Would recommend it for business trips, anniversaries or 1-2 days stays for higher budget tourists that want to see a bit of Nicosia.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This is probably the best hotel in Nicosia. The rooms are nice and clean, the swimming pool is great. The staff is helpful. The breakfast buffet is adequate.

Another drawback is that sometimes, the swimming pool is closed early on weekends for local weddings.",The Landmark Nicosia

The room was big and comfortable, very clean, with an excellent room service. The breakfast buffet was very rich and had a very big choice of fresh fruits (bio!), cheese, different styles of yoghurt, fresh juices... The people working in the Hilton are the real asset as they are all very friendly and helpful, I never had to say or order things twice, it was excellent! And always with a smile! I never had dinner there but I saw that the pool restaurant was quite full! The Hotel is within walking distance from the Old Town but taxis are always available. As I was in an executive room, I had free access to the lounge where free meals and drinks are available at all hours. I was astonished by the variety and the freshness of the fruits and the salads and the juices at the lounge! They refill all the time! I definitely recommend it!

The hotel is really very good, with smart, fully equipped rooms, great indoor and outdoor pools, rich breakfast, excellent service and very friendly and available staff. A bank and various shops (including a sport shop, a hairdresser / barber shop, an utilities shop) could be found in its premises. They could be very useful and they are very discreet.The executive lounge, accessible if you are booked in an executive room, is very pleasant. Please however note that, while drinks (both cold and hot) are available throughout the opening times (07.00-23.00), food is only available for breakfast and some snacks and salads are available in the evenings (until 20.00). There is no fresh food served for lunch or in the afternoon (apart from some fruit), which is a pity.Additional services are, however, quite expensive. One hour use of wi-fi costs 6 euro and a 50 cl bottle of mineral water costs 6 euros too. Food in the resturant is excellent and the buffet is rich but prices are also towards the higher end.In any case, it is really an excellent hotel - highly recommended.",The Landmark Nicosia

You don't need to be staying there- you can get monthly, yearly or even day memberships. The pool is particularly popular on the weekends. This might put you off if you are thinking of staying there but it really is the opporite- because the facilities are always being used, everything is kept in top notch condition. The indoor pool especially is fabulous and not at all cold and the spa faciities are brilliant. They also have daily workout classes in the gym, so definitely bring your workout gear and your swimsuit.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"This hotel is very comfortable and has excellent facilities. My only grumble is that it was quite a hike from the centre of Nicosia - at least a 15-20 minute walk to get even to the outskirts of the town. This meant that eating opportunities were limited to what was around or in the hotel unless we wanted a substantial walk or a taxi ride. (There were a few local restaurants but none that were particularly recommended, they were just average.). The staff were very helpful and the food in the hotel was great, particularly the breakfast buffet which was very well stocked. I ate in the hotel restaurant alone one evening and was made to feel very welcome and comfortable. The gym and leisure facilities were good, although they got very busy after office hours with non residents using the facilities after work. I was particularly pleased because I left some stuff in one of the drawers in the room and these were posted on to me without any fuss whatsoever! Excellent service!",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"Stayed at Hilton Cyprus 2 weeks ago for 2 nights. Upfront, the staff tried to meet this business traveler's need, but were always out of step. ( I note that after I left a review on the Hilton site, I was contracted by the General Manager with whom I shared the material below.) About 40 minutes from the airport Nice lobby, no doorman, front desk had only 1 person working. Staff was very nice. However the room was a throwback to earlier times. Clean but not very current. Internet connections are limited to just one device, at an extra cost per day. So if you have two phones and a iPad or laptop, you have to log in and log out every time you want to update the next device. I stay at a lot of international hotels, and this is just not an acceptable situation. I have an American Macbook, and I normally travel with a bag of adapters, but this rush trip I forgot them. so I needed an adapter to meet the local electrical receptacles. The desk at first did not know what I was referring to as the requirement. Then they did not have one. They found one the next day, but I lost a day's worth of work when I was in the hotel. There are no available outlets to charge your devices. All outlets are taken in what seems to be an archaic electrical scheme for the room. You have to unplug a desk lamp to get one available outlet. The reading lamps on the side of the bed are large, but do not throw off any light to actually read in bed. I tried to iron a shirt and the iron supplied by the hotel blew the circuit breaker. Another day to get it fixed. I only ate breakfast (buffet) at the restaurant which was fine. Overall, there is no doubt the staff tried to accommodate me, but an outdated room, a terrible internet policy and a lack of anticipation of the needs of an international business traveler hold the rating to 3 stars.",The Landmark Nicosia

There service is good (certainly for Cyprus) and very friendly and looking at the interior you can see that this once was great but is now start to look a bit tired. I visited the hotel year a go and I kind of got the feeling nothing really had changed including the menus in the restaurant (even though that is probably not true but I kind of wonder why nothing is being done) That said, when I chose Hilton for business it’s more for the fact that I know that things like Internet, reservations, etc. will work as expected (and that the hairdryer is in the top drawer if not in the bathroom…) rather than for their trendy interior and chic staff and I will most probably stay here the next time as well rather than taking my chances at another hotel in Nicosia….",The Landmark Nicosia

Excellent breakfast in main breakfast room and also in the executive lounge. Nice snacks (enough to make a meal) and drinks in executive lounge also. We left our first rental car in their parking lot to cross to the Turkish side for two nights. That was involved. We took a taxi (he covered up part of his license plate and removed the taxi sign from the roof) to the border, then another rental car was delivered to us at the border. Going back to the Greek side, we had our second rental car agent drive us to the crossing, we then walked through the border, then had the guards call another taxi to the Hilton to pick up our first rental car. It was all worth it, though.

The rooms are well equipped and comfortable, it is quiet and the staff are friendly and helpful. In particular the breakfast is excellent. It is however, about 15 minutes walk from Nicosia centre and there are limited restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The hotel's own restaurant is pretty good but a bit pricey. I would recommend it to anybody, if you check my reporting record you will see I travel a fair amount and reasonably widely, this hotel stands out for me, not for one special area, rather an overall 'they know what they are doing and do it well'.

Welcoming was ok, although when I asked if I could already pay upon arrival given that I would be leaving very early the next day this was not possible. There was no porter to help with luggage. The room was comfortable and large with pleasant colours. The hotel's areas as well as the bedroom were clean and smelled nice. Luckily there were double windows in the bedroom, as noise from the main avenue below could have been a problem. It was good to see that there was provision for all kinds of plugs in the room. Some amenities were missing from the bathroom. Breakfast was good but nothing extraordinary. I found the room price a little high for March (considered as off-season in Cyprus). One can get a seaview room in one of the 5 star hotels in the coastal towns, such as Limassol, with the same price. I guess the hotel has its steady flow of clients coming to Nicosia for business, given the government offices etc.Generally an OK hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia

The room we were in could have done with a lock on the door leading out on the balcony though. It was rather old, although quite well maintained. Excellent breakfast and good scrambled eggs.2 negatives here though - the wifi - it was charged for and the signal could have been far better - also I had to keep logining in despite having bought 72 hours - and also the cost of beverages... Well I thought Greece was expensive but they were charging 5.70 for a single cappuchino or tea and a litre of local water cost 4 euro in the lobby bar and 5 Euro in the room.

40,"HiltonHilton Cyprus is one of those establishment who must have had his heydays in the 90ies. Regardless of the colourful outdated interior, their rooms do however provide some basic level of comfort: large space and balcony, large firm twin beds with good bedding, marble bathroom (ammentities provided: shampoo, conditionner, body wash and body cream, bathrobe and slippers), flat screen LG tv (all relevant newschannels, a couple german franch italian and oriental channels for free - further satellite channels on demand as well as a bad bouquet of films on demand for about 14 euro per 3 hours), kettle for complimentary coffee (normal and decaff) as well as black, chamomille and mint tea, ironing board, safe, a proper hairdryer, minibar (water 5 euro, beer 7, chocolate 6, little can of mixed nuts 15). Door to the balcony may only be closed with two little lock chains, always check that they are locked as maids tend to leave them unlocked after cleaning the balcony. Aircondition can easily be switched on or off and  temperature adjustment works good. The sound insulation of the rooms is a bit poor, bring earplugs if you have a light sleep. Maids also begin hovering the floor at 7am and are quite chatty.The Hiltonia Club is certainly the strong point of this hotel, with 3 to 5 gym courses a day (TRX, Less Mills, Pilates, Yoga, Body Balance, Body attack, Zumba, dance aerobics, ABS, cardio, tango, tabata, step, power hour....). Inside pool is a bit uninspiring and not that big (aquagym in the evening), if good weather use large outsidepool. There's also a work out room and a dedicated room with running mills and crosssteppers. Basic Sauna and steambath ammenties are gender split and it is allowed to keep the swimming gear on.Massages can also be booked;the rates are on the higer end of average charges for this service (30 min reflexologie 50 euro...). Don't expect anything special it's just okish.There's also a hairdresser in the lobby. Wash and style 20 euros - totally recommendable. Ask for Mr. Andreas he does a very good job at this. My previous hairdressers could never get curls into my hair for more than 2 hours. Andreas however managed to make a curly hairdo that even survived a two stop homeflight :) woow. Wash and cut from 30 euros on, manicure 18 euros.Downsides: 1) The Fontana Restaurant has a local colorful touch and the staff is very dedicated, however the food is only of medium quality. 2) Some of the reception staff is also a bit elder and hence not that customer fixed and helpful as standard 5 star staff. 3) Some floors do smell strange of sour milk and trash. 4) The rooms are clean but its rather a 3 star clean than a really torough well done job. 5) there are often some kind of 'celebrities' who are either themselves blocking the lobby or their fans are - during my 4 night stay it happened twice - I had to endure hysterical teenagers for 24h screeming and whining under my balcony and though bodyguards preventing me from taking the lift to access my room because some couple choose to give interviews in the lobby.Compared to international 5 starred hotels Hilton cyprus can't keep up the standard. Rather rate it as a local coloured 4 star establishment.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We were staying in Pafos and wanted to have a casino night so booked the Hilton Cyprus using HHonors points (bringing the price to £40 per room) so we could cross into Northern Cyprus.Upon arriving the hotel looked very nice. Designer shops are present throughout the lower floor with designer goods displayed all the way down to the Foyer. Unusually this hotel has its reception on the 2nd floor so don't go looking on the ground floor thinking you missed it.The reception staff were friendly and helpful and automatically upgraded us to executive rooms (as we were gold card holders). Upon entering the rooms, they were spacious and reasonably well decorated, however for a five star Hilton I did expected a higher standard of furnishing especially for an executive lounge. It seems this hilton just did the minimum it could to meet the 5 star criteria. To stress the rooms were not at all bad, just I had higher expectations from 5 star Hiltons due to staying in the Park Lane hilton.Anyway during our stay we made use of the executive lounge which serves free alcoholic beverages until 8pm (the employee was kind enough to leave the food out a lil longer and give us a couple of bottles of wine as we arrived at 8pm unknowingly) - which was much appreciated.Upon entering the bar area downstairs I asked to play the grand piano. I was advised that the one in the main sitting area was not for use, however another grand piano was available that I could play in the smaller bar. This of course pleased me greatly and I serenaded my friends for a few minutes on the piano before heading off to the casino.In the morning we visited the spa facilities. The gym setup is kind of inconveniant with the pool being in a seperate area from the jacuzzi. sauna and steam room and also having two changing rooms. In the end I had to walk back and fore the reception area in my swimming trunks dripping of water so I could use the steam room after my swim.The girls ordered room service and were happy with the food and the breakfast in the morning was of a very good standard, although some potato scones would have made it perfect.All in all a pretty good stay and if this was a 4 star hotel it would have got full marks, only reason is that I expect the executive rooms of a 5 star hilton to be furnished to a higher standard. Also although good value for money when using my points, the right price of the executive room per night at short notice was 290 euros. I don't believe I would have been happy if I had paid that price.Tip to all booking early in 2012. Hilton Cyprus is in the Hilton Point Stretcher Rewards, so you can get the room for next to nothing for only 17,500 hilton points.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Now this is a seriously good hotel. I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip. You get everything here that you can ask for in a good hotel. Clean, tidy, good food, excellent atmosphere - the full works. Staff is really helpful, try for an upgrade. Location is quite central BUT you have to walk to get to the city centre – about 10-15 mins walk. Breakfast was quite good and had plenty to choose from. If you are visiting Nicosia and are confused which hotel to go for, this is the one. A message for the staff there - keep up the good work.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"It is situated very near the center of the capital, just 10 mins walking distance. Ideal for those who want to sight see around Nicosia and are not afraid to walk a bit. A hotel with lots of History behind which has always been the best Hotel of Nicosia. It is an old type Hilton, in a good sense. Traditional Hilton luxury (I have seen Hiltons who don't deserve to be having the name) kept and reserved over the decades even though ownership changed few years back.A big plus to this hotel is that many of the workers there are still Cypriots and their Hotel-pedia is far advanced form others. The touristic and hotel management schools of the island are of the best in Europe in my opinion and they do know better how to treat clients.The moment u get inside this hotel it makes you feel unique. The staff is more than happy to serve you and the facilities are excellent. Rooms, lobby, cafeterias, restaurants, gym, pools (external and heated internal) library, conference halls, shops... u name it.Anything is u need this hotel can provide. Businessman or honeymoon couple, solo or with friends, you can have some quality time in this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We stayed here for a special occasion and used there offer of 50% off. Only downside to this establishment is the location as it is walk to the town centre, Taxi trip required. Seizable rooms with standard high class fittings.Book executive lounge to allow access to free bar and food at advertised times.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We visited the Hilton at the end of December 2011. Its one of the smaller Hiltons, probably built in about the 50's/60's and still in the style of that era which took me back to my youth - almost retro in style. It was clean and comfortable and not in the least shabby despite its age and we rather liked it. The room was very nice, with everything we needed and both the service and housekeeping excellent. Breakfast is a huge and very generous buffet - highly recommended. We will definitely return, though not in the summer months as although we enjoyed our stay, I doubt that we would be prepared to pay high season rates to stay there - it is really primarily a business hotel.The hotel is on one of the main roads into Nicosia and thus easy to find, but the location is not great for tourists. It is difficult to walk to anywhere from it so you do have to have a car (It took us 10/15 minutes to drive to the old city) and the busy road does not make walking particularly pleasant.To sum up, you should find clean, comfortable accommodation whenever you stay here.One tip - if you don't want to eat in the restaurant and are tired of room service, there is a little bakery just by the traffic lights outside the hotel, which does very good pies. (On the main road, just turn right at the first traffic lights and it is straight ahead on a corner).",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We visited this hotel for 4 nights over New Year's Eve. We were attending a wedding held at one of the ballrooms so it was the obvious choice. Although the room itself wasn't what I would call a 5-star (even though we stayed in an Executive room), the breakfast buffet was brilliant and service was fantastic. We also got complimentary local cakes and dried fruits for New Year's Eve, which I thought was a nice touch.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"We hired a car travelling around cyrpus and feared trying to find the hotel in the city but arrived at it no probs (just loo out for the big H). Staff at reception were so friendly giving us infomation about the hotel and the surrounding area.

Really cant say enough good things about this hotel and its staff.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"We visited the Hilton Cyprus in Nicosia for 2 nights (30th December until 1st of January), overall the hotel was okay, and I can rate the stay as okay as well; but to be honest it was lower than what I expected from a 'Hilton' hotel. Being to too many 5 stars hotels around the world, this hotel is a 5 star but has nothing special about it. Maybe the bad impression was caused by the renovations that were happening in the hotel lobby , but I noticed that there was no concierge, no valet parking, and from the reception to our room we had to go through two different building blocks and 2 elevators. The breakfast is less than 5 stars for sure! and when we ordered breakfast to our room, we found the glass of orange juice to be dirty.I will not complain much since the price that we paid was relatively low, due to a sales promotion.Finally, to be fair to the hotel, the location is ideal (in the heart of Nicosia, close to shopping district, the mall, and the old town). Maybe after all i have to blame it on the city, because what I have heard that the city doesn't have a lot of hotels, and this Hilton is the only 5 stars hotel in Nicosia.Bottom line, book it if there is a promotion",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"I visited the Hilton for a business meeting in October.For 43 consecutive years it stands as a symbol of exclusivity and a luxurious landmark. It won the award of Best City Hotel in Cyprus for the second consecutive year, voted by readers of the Conde Nast Traveller Awards 2010 under the category of ‘city hotels/ Cyprus, and was chosen for its high level of services and irreproachable hospitality. It also secured the first place as the most popular in the same category. It is the hotel that spoils and pampers its guests. This happened to me on this trip.I felt like home and I am not exaggerating. Starting with the staff who are surely professionals and multilingual they know well how to make their guests feel like home.Personally, I postponed until the coming trip to Cyprus, 3 dinner invitations I had in the city those days and chose to remain in the premises.I had a spacious room (#555) on the Executive floor. Here rooms are much bigger than the Hilton guest rooms and I felt so relaxed and comfortable not only from the amenities found here but the soft colours, décor, and its minimalistic style and touch of luxury. There was nothing exaggerating and all amenities functional and useful.The bed was huge and lovely just as I expected it to be with huge fluffy pillows. There was a mini bar and just above a separate open space with shelves for glasses, wine, and some delicacies on offer. I found the corner desk with the laptop very functional although I had my own and I spent much time out there working while at the premises.There was a flat TV with ample of local and international channels to choose from, and one of the two armchairs was next to the side table with an impressive lampshade and coffee facilities. This spot had become my favourite corner for my afternoon coffee when I wanted to watch the news. The emphasis in the whole premises is on elegance and comfort.The huge mirror in the bathroom made the room seem bigger but it was spacious all right. Toiletries (Crabtree & Evelyn) collection, and when I asked for one or two more I was brought a handful.The Hilton knows well how to pamper their guests with some VIP courtesies upon arrival. I had a surprise indulgence with fruit and a bottle of some red wine at first. Minutes later I had a plate with Cypriot delicacies in syrup and later some white roses were brought from the cleaning lady for the bathroom creating in minutes a pleasant ambience in this room! Later on, in the afternoon there was another knock on the door, this time I was brought some snacks. (Make sure to put the safety chain behind the door because some male waiters just knock and enter even before you answer).Guests with rooms on the Executive floor have access to the Executive Lounge on the 6th floor. A beautifully decorated room with fitted carpet comfortable sofas and armchairs creating different private corners, soft pleasing to the ears music, and open for the executive guests free for dining, drinks and nibbles.The most demanding guest will be pleased with the more than adequate American breakfast offered here. A variety of cereals, dry fruit, omelettes, sausages, mushrooms, pan cakes, ham and bacon, grilled Cypriot cheese (halloumi) yoghurt, rice pudding, different kinds of bread, croissants, biscuits and cakes. Everything is of excellent quality and taste and always under the supervision of professional staff like Gregory’s and many more.Dinner at the stunning (seasonal) Pergola Grill and Bar Restaurant, -the latest addition to the Hilton by the pool the last night of functioning was a challenge. The Executive chef Adreas Georgiou with the rest of chefs and cooks seem to work miracles in the kitchen. The presentation of every dish brought was like a piece of art. The exceptional culinary standards, the taste and ambience set the scene for stylish dining in soft pleasing to the ears music. Andreas Yiallourides is another asset for the Hilton.Another favourite spot was the Spa where I tried to combine business with pleasure. The Thai massage I had was so comforting and relaxing, but the Jacuzzi, the Steam bath and Sauna were just as good. I was amazed to see so many locals who are members and come here to exercise and spoil themselves. I consider it one of the most luxurious health clubs in Nicosia.Internet is not free here, but it has become a standard benefit (free of charge) for HHonors Gold and Diamond members only. It is a hotel geared predominantly to the business clientele making it an ideal meeting point, with just a 20 minutes’ walk from Nicosia’s highest points.So, with all the above it is not surprising that the Hilton in Cyprus consistently ranks as the international business community’s first choice. I highly recommend it and I truly can’t wait to return shortly.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed here for one night in the executive suite, after being sent here due to a flight delay. I only got this room as it was the last one and they was reluctant to give it!Very pleasant and clean rooms, with a luxurious feel and look to them. The bedroom had a lovely bed, a desk with chair and laptop, tea coffee, side tables and comfortable bed linen and fluffy pillows. The decor had an old fashioned feel to it., which i liked as it seemed more homely and glamourous, however the carpets need updating. The bathroom was lovely with crabtree and evelyn toiletries and was clean, shiny and luxiourious with a complimentary fluffy bath robe and slippers to use . The mini bar area looked very nice. was presented nicely and had its own lighting. Was was great about this suite was the many different light controls you could choose for effect-there were different profiles, profile 1 was dim with brighter highlights, profile 2 bright, profile 3 a highlight effect ect, or you could adjust the lighting manually. That was a nice touch. Both the bedroom and front room had flat screen TV with a good amount of channels, with films ect. The front room had sofa and seating areas arranged in a circle pattern-lots of chairs to sit on each with their own style, again in a tradditional theme which others may find dated however i quite liked it, had enough of the minimalist square block theme you see in many other modern hotels. There was a unit with several interesting books to read about Cyprus and a large midi hi fi system that we could use, never seen that before that was great! as mentioned before a flat screen TV and a central music system that you controlled by a switch inc volume control which played music from celing speakers-great! the balcony snaked round from the front room to the bedroom and was clean, but needed updating. You could entertain people in this suite for sure.the hotel grounds had a luxurious professional feel to it with a hairdresser, bank, business shops and a small supplies shop. This hotel was definitely aimed at the businessperson being in the capital city and had several conference rooms. To reach the excecutive suite area you had your own beautiful glass lifts. There were around 4-5 tennis courts, a large pool and i would love to stay here again-shame there is no beach nearby! If you like modern minimalist hotels this isnt for you but if you like 50's type glamour, brass fittings and a touch of luxury and old school charm then you would like it.",The Landmark Nicosia

30,"I was there for 6 nights on the business trip. Maybe I was there when hotel was having a bad time.At first, let me write about things that I liked:- Swimming pool – it was great to swim during the sunset after the working day.- Breakfast – good! A lot of different kinds of fruits, corn flakes and hallumi cheese.- Swimming pool view from the balcony.Things I didn’t like:- Internet connection is pretty expensive. For 3 days it was ~70 EUR.- Whole room was stinking of mustiness and yes, I had door opened during the whole evening. After couple of days all my business clothes were stinking a little with this smell. I understand the high humidity level but can’t they just deal with this?- Staff organization – when I was checking in ~4 AM in a morning and I was 2nd, it took around 15 minutes. There were 2 people operating while “in service” was just only one person.- Lift - well there are two. One was not operating for my whole stay (Sun-Sat). It was always crawded in the morning! It was pretty hard to get there, many people wanted to use it!!! Forget about getting something quickly from the room... I hope the lift is working right now.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"As Hilton has a well functioning routine when it comes to service, efficiency and tidiness, I will not comment on that. And the premises are nice - if you enjoy the classic and comfy style of American top hotels, you will like your stay even in Hilton Cyprus.What annoys me, is the way a top class hotel charges for services that ought to be free and considered basic services by now. My example: 6 euros/hour for the use of WLAN!? Why on earth? Even cheaper hotels are willing to provide something as basic as that - mostly without any further charges. Just like airports, department stores, cafés et.c.WLAN/WiFi is merely a necessary tool for any professional. Do us all a favor, and simply include the wireless connection in the price of the room. Much smoother that way.All the rest was great, as usually in Hilton. Thank you.",The Landmark Nicosia

40,"Being a diamond member we were upgraded to the executive wing which had a glass lift in the atrium. Very nice spacious bright room, classically furnished. Got a complementary water on the first night but not on subsequent nights. The executive lounge was very comfortable and had a nice selection of hot and cold canapes early evening, limited choice of alcohol was available from around 6.00 to 8.30pm. The food and drink is expensive, more so than the UK Hiltons. The hotel amenities are very good, shops on site and a nice pool area. Some building work was underway but it didn't impact on us as it was being done in the main building, no noise heard when we were by the pool. Great breakfast choice and outdoor seating available by the pool. The main restaurant was closed in the evenings and meals were taken by the poolside although you could eat in the indoor bar where it was cooler. The hotel is at the far end of one of the main shopping roads and if the weather wasn't so hot we would have walked into the centre. The taxi's are on hand at the hotel and cost 6 euros into town. For a cheaper meal we found a local restaurant 500 yards down the road. The staff were very helpful and arranged sightseeing tours.

Our room had a view of the beautiful swimming pool and the mts. in the background, so I would definitely ask for a back room and not one in the front on the noisy street. The rooms have all the Hilton ammenities and were nicely decorated and very clean. Room service was prompt and efficient and they had a very nice breakfast in the morning. The pool is fabulous too.

40,"I spent 4 days here on business. The hotel is very nice in many respects. Rooms are very well kept, service is excellent, as is the lavish breakfast buffet. The outdoor pool is really beautiful (and large enough for lap swimming in addition to just paddling around). At the same time, if you're looking for local charm/character, this is probably not the place for you. The location is not too central, either, but it's not too difficult to get to the historic city center.A couple of additional notes. One evening I had the dinner buffet at the restaurant. It seemed overpriced at 30 Euros, but the food was really rather good, and dining on the patio by the pool made it even nicer. I discovered that there is a large park around 300 yards from the hotel, next to the old University of Cyprus buildings, which is very nice for a peaceful morning stroll or run (perimeter loop is almost 3 miles). On the negative side, the price for internet access is ridiculously high. We know that it's primarily the more expensive hotels that charge for internet access, and this looks like gouging.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I've stayed here twice for 3 nights in the last 2 weeks. The first 3 nights I stayed in standard room 426. This room with a view on the pool was already of the normal Hilton standard, i.e. good.I still don't get it: why do these hotel chains still charge for internet? At cheaper hotels you get it for free, while here you need to pay €15 per day.I need to use it for work, so it will be reimbursed to me, but this internet only works reliable in the room. In the lounge, bar and pool the signal is not everywhere strong enough. So, if you are being charged for it, make at least sure that it is available everywhere!I selected at first login a 3 day package. When I checked out before going to breakfast, and going back to the room afterwards I still needed to use the internet, but it was already disconnected. I had to go to reception and 'beg' to give me another hour for free. This resulted in a lot of effort for the staff.Even more effort was required during my second stay....here I was upgraded to the executive floor which has free internet....at least that was told to me at check-in. At checkout it was of course charged...Again a discussion was needed to remove the internet charges from the bill.At the same time somebody else checking out also complained about the wrong charging of it...When at the executive floor you have free access (with your room card) to the executive lounge where drinks and food are for free. Nothing to complain here, but I don't recommend taking breakfast here. Go to the normal breakfast as the choice is more extensive there.This 'normal' breakfast is very good! Plenty of choice in drinks and food, fruit and everything you might need for breakfast.Very small detail, but I found the beep in the elevator for every floor you pass annoying. Specially when you have to go to the highest (executive) floor :-)In the executive room there is a laptop, so if you are HHonors gold you don't have to bring your own...Avoid a room at the street side, like 660, as it forces you to sleep with the windows closed and therefore the airco on. Not my preference.By rental car it is easy to find, just follow the highway from Larnaca that becomes a dual carriageway when entering Nicosia. Straight ahead until you see it in front of you. Parking is free and ample available.The pool is very nice...starting with a swim every morning is magnificent!",The Landmark Nicosia
50,Nicosia is small but I was pleasantly surprised to visit this oasis in Nicosia. It's large and spacious and although it was too cold the outdoor pool looked very inviting. The service was great because it was so natural. I was only there 2 nights on business and didn't get to use many facilities but next time will try and organise it so that I can. Good choice at breakfast too.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Great hotel, well located and well appointed suite. Staff and service was excellent.",The Landmark Nicosia
20,First of all the parking is a nightmare. There was no one at the valet and took us 5 minutes to find someone. The lady who checked us in was the manager and she was very pleasant. We had booked the executive club room. The rooms are of poor standard for the price you pay. About the level of a 3 star hotel. Few english speaking channels on the TV and the pay movies where not available. The executive lounge was was the worst i have been in any where in the world and the staff where very condescending. The food was awful. The breakfast was worse. You had to pay extra for breakfast and honestly i would not feed it to a dog! My fiancée being 33 and myself 38 we felt little respect from the staff most of whom appeared well into their 50's or older. One of the worse value hotels I have stayed in anywhere. Obviously Paris needs the money more than me to be serving this quality at such a ridiculous price!,The Landmark Nicosia
40,I travel regularly to Cyprus and this is always my place of choice in Nicosia. The staff are very accomodating and the location is ideal for business in the centre of the city. On this occassion my luggage was delayed by two days. the hotel made an effort to replace all toiletries from the gift shop at their expense. always a pleasure to stay here.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"In all respects I found this hotel to be very good. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was large and well furnished and the breakfast excellent. I found the bed extremely comfortable (and I am very fussy about beds) and slept very well. Though I didn't use it, the pool was large and very inviting. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"As a regular traveller I found the Hilton in Nicosia to be of a very high standard in terms of customer service, comfortable rooms and an excellent choice for breakfast, if you are a business traveller I highly recommend this hotel, it even had a hotel lap top in the room with complimentary tea and coffee , we had won a free nights stay at this hotel and was expecting to be put up in a old room, however the room we had was fantastic, the front office staff were extremely helpful and George at the front desk was very polite and always at hand for offering to reserve tables for us . Well done Hilton Nicosia you really compete with other European hotels much to my surprise !",The Landmark Nicosia
20,"Stayed here for 4 nights on Hilton Honors points. Was upgraded to the Honeymoon suite upon check in for a supplement of EUR129 per night.Small issues with housekeeping in that tea and coffee was never replenished in the room and the bed was as hard as a rock. Worst 4 nights sleep I have ever had. The place lacks any warmth and is expensive. Cannot walk into the town centre in the heat of the day as a bit too far out. Exec Lounge OK.Although it may nit be an every day event, our stay coincided with a diplomatic lunch given by the President of Cyprus to mark Cyprus Independence day. Obviously, this necessitated a cetain level of security but because the hotel management saw fit to give over the entire hotel entrance and lobby to the security men, there was no provision for guests to enter or leave without running an intimidating gannut of security guards and police officers whose manners left a lot to be desired. Additionally, all previously available parking was closed off by police who simply weren't interested in the fact that as guests, we should be afforded reasonable ease of access for us and our vehicle.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"I was in Hilton Nicosia last year, and I may it has improved since. There seems to be some renovation in the lobby area. The rooms are spacious and all amenities are present. Not at a luxury level, but this is not necessay in Nicosia where you are not staying in room a lot.The pool is a great value, because it is large and deep. Open all day, except maybe at some evenings because the pool area is a usual place to hold marriage receptions.The hotel is at the city entrance on the main avenue. Though people don't walk a lot in Cyprus, it is only 20-30 minutes on foot to reach the city historical center. On the way to the center there are many nice fashion shops and a few cafes.",The Landmark Nicosia
20,"Is it me rather than the hotel chain? Are my expectations too high? Do I cling to the old fashioned idea that the Hilton brand is eponimous with quality and five stars means the highest level of service and comfort? Whatever, this is not a quality hotel and it does not deserve a five star rating, but then neither does any other Hilton hotel I have stayed in, so, is it me?At the Hilton Cyprus, there was no lobby service so we handled our bags ourselves, the check in was efficient but frosty, no eye contact. The rooms were clean and fresh, but no alcohol in the mini bar (only on the executive floors apparently), No five star added value -dressing gowns or sllppers, and the room service was a long, long, costly disaster. Down stairs, at lunchtime, the bar was closed, as was the outside pool. OK, every hotel has a tension between what it offers and what it charges, but really, this for £135 a night?Cyprus has become careless and overpriced because of its unique position between the money of the West and oil of the Middle East, and in my experience, unfortunately, the Hilton Cyprus reflects this. Oh, yes, you have to pay for watching movies on the TV in your room, £15 a throw.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"The best thing about this hotel was the staff. Very genuinely friendly and helpful. Came here for a few days thanks to a good pacakage deal.This is the Hilton so you expect certain standards. It was certainly clean, comfortable and spacious with a good breakfast and so on. But it did lack a little sparkle. It needs a bit of renovation but all is of good to excellent standard.It loses some points because it is slightly too far up the main road to be easy distance to the centre. This day and age I would also expect that internet service would be much less than 6 Euro an hour.But again the staff was great",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"My third trip to the hotel in 18 months, although was not welcomed as a returning guest as such.Rooms are roomy with balcony and complimentary biscuits and red wine (although it didn't taste great!) I was on an executive floor which gave me use of an executive lounge and complimentary drinks and snacks which is great when you are travelling alone.As I was checking in, the reception were waiting for the Queen of Spain to arrive so I guess it must be a well thought of hotel!It's not as plush as the Hilton Athens, as it can't match the views, but is's clean and friendly.Downside is that even if you order cabs in advance, they can take up to an hour to arrive, which isn't great if you need to get to meetings!I probably wouldn't stay here for pleasure, but for business it does the job!",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"This is the only 5 star Hotel in Nicosia. While it does deserve its stars, the Hotel is already in need of refurbishment: both rooms and public areas are showing their age (with the possible exception of the Executive Rms, which are more recently built). Considering the obsolescence of the rooms and the public areas, it is possible that this Hotel is somewhat overpriced. Other than that, location, staff, breakfast and basic facilities are good or, in any event, well above average. All in all, a reasobaly good choice of Hotel, unique in its kind in Nicosia, but with some room for improvement on many fronts.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Hotel is a little old.Rooms are tired as well as public areas.

40,"The hotel is a little on the expensive side but I definitely have no complaints at all after my stay there. The rooms were spotless, the staff attentive and polite and the hotel well located, only half an hour from the airport and 5 minutes from the centre of Nicosia (by car). I wouldn´t say there was anything extra special about the hotel but as a business hotel it definitely serves its purpose.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"Excellent service, very professional and helpful staff. Location is not the best but stil close to the center. Food and especially breakfast is very good. Bar and lounges lively and cosy. Rooms are very clean, large and fully stocked. This is not your typical chain hotel: It has character mainly because of its late 70s decor, which although a tad tired adds to its charm. Great business hotel as I guess this is what most people are in Nicosia for: If you are on holidays, head for the beach...",The Landmark Nicosia
50,We went on a 3 night break to Cyprus with Emirates staying at the Hilton Cyprus in Nicosia and for the price we paid it was superb. The breakfasts were excellent and filled us up until evening dinner. We enjoyed all the hotel's facilites but ate out in the evenings as the hotel prices were too expensive. We would certainly go there again if there was a special deal in the future. Several of our friends have been on this trip within the last few weeks and all have enjoyed it.,The Landmark Nicosia
50,"This was my second stay there during the last 4 years. The location of this Hilton is not in the heart of the city, but it is in walking distance (about 20 min) from Ledra street and old town. It remains a very good hotel, with an impressive lobby, a very good restaurant, and a night bar (Paddock) with live music. Although decoration of the public spaces is of relatively old fashion, it creates a very relaxing and luxury ambient. Lobby bar is big, beautiful, overlooking the outside pool area, with live piano music in the evenings. Breakfast in the main restaurant was good (the typical ""Hilton breakfast""), with an inside and outside (by the pool) seating area. The hotel has also a well-equiped fitness center as well as an indoor heated pool. Quest room was ampious and well-equiped, with very good decoration. All the staff was well-trained, helpful and polite. If I retourn to Nicosia, I will stay again in this beautiful hotel.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"we stayed for 3 nights in May. The staff were very friendly andthe atnosphere was very elegant and nice. The rooms are bright and airy and were very clean. Breakfast was very good as well with plently of items to select from although I was a bit surprised as they didn't bacon. The fittness center is also very nice with all the needed equipment although some of it looks a little old.The location is good and the hotel is within walking distance of all attractions.We rented a car with Astra from the Hotel lobby. The car was fine and so were the explanations of the car company. However, don't take their advice to take the car full and return it empty bacause usually you won't be able to return empty and they overcharge on fuel (I think I overpaid by about 30 Euro.....)Overall, it was a very good experience.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,Spent couple of nights in January.The hotel is located in the entrance of the city and not in the center but as Nicosia is small everything is near by.My room was ok and the food was ok.Amenities as would someone expect .It is a business hotel therefore there is not the personal touch and they are just polite.Restaurant needs urgentky rtenovation as the chairs are very uncomfortable and old fashioned (though well maintained )Over all a nice hotel with nothing special,The Landmark Nicosia
30,"At first glance the hotel seems very posh, there is a nice kind of roundabout with palm trees in front of the entrance which we liked very much. Since we were three people we had a room with a double bed and an extra bed which was very uncomfortable and almost touched the floor, and got in the way of the balcony door... also we had a table which was placed in a strange position and we had to move it personally (it was very heavy!) just to be able to open the balcony door.... we were afraid to swith on the tv since it seems that everything is paid for in the hotel. Also we had no coffee making facilities even though they were listed in the guest room facilities brochure that we had in the room! Soap and stuff were not enough for three and the staff came everyday looking suspiciously at the minibar even though we did not even touch it.We had access to the spa (pool, sauna, etc) included in the price which we liked even though we were surrounded by naked women while being in the jacuzzi, seems to be a normal thing to do there... we stayed with our bikinis on though :)Breakfast was good but nothing too fancy, and coffee seems to be limited also... either that or the waitress just did not want to give us more coffee!Taxi service from the hotel is great, they get you one instantly in any time of the day (or night) and was cheap since the downtown is only 10 mins away. The reception was also helpful in giving us directions and info.Overall not bad but would not rate it as a 5star hotel, more like a 3 star.Oh... and there is not much nightlife in the surroundings!",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"Good, friendly service, clean and with good breakafast buffet and lively lounge/bar area in the evenings. Internet access is expensive though and the decor is a little bit tired.

Nothing special but clean and with a nice balcony over looking the pool.Beware there is no coffee making facility.Bathroom was very good with all usual soaps and stuff.Restaurant was excellent with good choice of food at both breakfast and dinner. The prices are high but the quality good. We loved the buffet dessert for 6 euros. As much chocolate cake as you can get on your plate.we found all staff very helpful and had time to have a little chat. They all spoke good english.,The Landmark Nicosia
40,Stayed here for 3 nights on a Business meeting. Excellent Business hotel with all expected facilities.Location is right in the middle of Nicosia.

30,"Good rooms, though nothing extraordinary, excellent air-conditioning, large outdoor pool, friendly reception and porters.Problems: unacceptable to have to pay 15 euro per day for internet, no bath robes (somebody else said can be requested), terrible pool bar service- 5 euro for a flat diet coke, the staff spoke no Greek or English and couldn't understand what ""flat"" or ""can"" meant- it was almost comic when the (Russian?) waiter said ""oh, you want gas!""",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"First the hotel, by itself is great but it lacksof several services, specially the Internet service, which you will need to pay 15 euros per day if you want to get conected. the decoration old fashion.

40,"Stayed there on business for 3 nights in June.LocationThe hotel is located on a busy Arch. Makarios street, which leads from the city center to the Larnaca airport. The street is quite noisy even at night and nearby construction works start early in the morning (before 8 am). You don’t need to worry about noise in your room, however, if you keep your windows closed at night.The hotel is within easy reach from the business areas (about 5 min by taxi).RoomsRooms are spacious and clean though the furniture would benefit from a few touch-ups.An in-room safe and Euro-plug adaptors would also be very useful.The hotel spares no money on air conditioning. (I actually thought it was not quite environmentally friendly to keep the aircon at 21 degrees while it was 37 outside!).The bathroom was reasonably sized, with all necessary amenities. The blowdryer, however, dated from the previous century and did not quite live up to the hotel’s 5 star status. I also didn’t have a bathrobe in the room, but I guess those were provided on request.The bed was large and comfortable, no gripes about that!ServiceThe hotel’s staff were friendly and efficient, I had no problem checking in and checking out, all questions were promptly answered.FoodThe food for dinner was ok but not terrific. I actually found food in local tavernas to be much tastier than at the hotel. Breakfast (served by the famous pool) was varied and offered a good choice of fruit in addition to the typical hotel breakfast stuff.FacilitiesThe hotel has a large pool (as mentioned above), which was quite popular at breakfast time) and a gym and tennis courts (which I didn’t use but which seemed quite popular with hotel guests and locals).The hotel seemed quite full even on weekend and was definitely in high demand on weekdays, so it’s a good idea to book in advance.Overall, my first experience with the Hitlon was positive, if I go to Nicosia again, I’d definitely consider this hotel again.",The Landmark Nicosia
40,"We had a very pleasant stay in Hilton Cyprus in the center of Nicosia. We stayed in the executive room, which was large, well equipped, nicely decorated – nothing special, but pleasant and comfortable. There is an executive lounge for the exec. rooms, with drink and light snacks available the whole day.The hotel has a great lobby, with numerous spaces for a business meeting or coffee with friends. The lobby faces an outside swimming pool. We didn’t go there, so not sure if it’s good or not.The staff were a real highlight: everyone is very friendly and polite. One downside of the hotel is a VERY tired health center, it is simply dirty there, the walls are very shabby, the plunge pool is nearly falling apart.The hotel is about 40 min drive (50 Euro taxi ride) from the Nicosia airport, located in the city center, about 10 min drive from the historic center of the town.",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"Have stayed in a few hotels in Nicosia on business over the years but the Hilton Nicosia is by far the best. Not to be confused with the Hilton Park, which is more to the outskirts of the city, the Hilton is slap bang in downtown Nicosia meaning it is ideal for business but also for getting out and about the central part of the city, the walls, Ledra street and close to some good restaurants.The hotel itself has good restaurant, large bar area, great outdoor pool - especially if temperatures are rising, but also an indoor pool and health club.Rooms are good, service friendly and overall a hotel I enjoy returning to.",The Landmark Nicosia
30,"The hotel advertises itself as 5 star but in reality it is 3 star in the old part of the hotel or 4 star in the new part of the hotel.I routinely stay in the hotel as it is close to a number of my clients in Nicosia.On the positive side the rooms are quite large, there is a large outdoor pool (perfect for swimming lengths), a decent gym and indoor pool and staff are generally very friendly.On the negative side, the hotel is pretty much a concrete block although there are balconies, the restaurant is nothing to write home about (nice but not brilliant) and sometimes getting a taxi can take a while.",The Landmark Nicosia

50,"The Hilton Cyprus on Makarios Avenue in Nicosia is a five star property. I paid 96 CYP per night on a special deal associated with a company in Nicosia. The lobby is fairly elegant, and the pool area is definitely elegant. Rooms are large. There is a far too small parking lot. And the entrance is a bit strange coming off a drive into the parking lot. Breakfast was included in the cited rate -- and this was superb. There were huge tables of foods -- mostly exotic -- but many English specialties. You'll brush elbows with the Italian embassador and others like this in the lobby. The neighborhood is a bit out of Nicosia -- and walking downtown is a bit hectic -- too many street crossings without traffic lights, and high density traffic. There is a second Hilton in Nicosia -- and I never saw that one.",The Landmark Nicosia

The staff was very friendly and polite, even though those working in the dining room gave me the impression of being bored -if i may say. The view from our balcony was not the best in the world but we didn't care much since all the rest in our room were perfect.Two are the things I disliked:1) The hotel is a bit far from the city center (about 20 min. on foot), and 2) on our first day at the hotel and during the breakfast -which was excellent by all means- I found that my cup of coffee had signs of lipstick on it. Of course they apologized and replaced it immediately, but this little incident ruined the good impression I had for the hotel. It is a pity because it is a very good hotel, honestly...",The Landmark Nicosia
50,"I stayed here for a conference and took my son, aged 12 and husband along. We arrived late and the staff were very welcoming, and had assigned us a very spacious room with ample space for a bed for my son. It overlooked the front of the hotel, not the pool but was quiet enough for a busy area. The pool was more inviting then the candid photos show, but it rained a lot so we only used it once! The public areas of the hotel are very smart, and the breakfast area is particularly nice, overlooking the pool. The bar is lovely, but very expensive. I travelled with a disabled colleague and this area is not very wheelchair friendly. Although not a child hotel, my son was never made to feel unwelcome, in fact the staff in the bar and restaurant were great with him.Overall a great stay - people friendly, and it was my first stay in Cyprus which made me want to return. As a business hotel, it was very good indeed.",The Landmark Nicosia

Great service, large rooms and fantastic breakfeast.Being in Cyprus for business this hotel had everything I was looking for. Next time I go I'll try the pool as well that looks great.The only negative remark is the ""classic"" furniture in my room, typical Hilton. Being under thirty I tend to appreciate the modern look slightly more.So, if you are in Cyprus for business this is the place to go for.",The Landmark Nicosia

It is fun to see the locals at work & play -but if you prefer mellow quite, do not stay here -the vibe is metropolitain.I do not think I would spend too long here as a tourist bc the coastal areas are so beautiful -but it was good to see the old city and the green line. The city has vast history -well worth hiring a local guide to point out sites and help you avoid the chotsky shops that haunt the old city.City has some great clubs -try Arabesque on a Sunday",The Landmark Nicosia

Once you enter the grand, beautiful lobby there are comfortable couches and tables to sit at.The room was a decent size and was well kept. There is a balcony off the room and depending on where you are located in the hotel, you may have a view of the pool. It does take a bit of time to walk into town from the hotel, but there are several restaurants and shops that are within walking distance. There are also several shops in the hotel, including a shop to buy sodas, magazines, etc, which is very convenient.The breakfast buffet is amazing - fruits, fresh breads/baked goods, meats, etc. The presentation was beautiful and we never had difficulty getting a table. Within the lobby there is seating that you can be served at. This was very enjoyable, sitting in the beautiful lobby and enjoying tea and dessert. I attended as part of a study tour with my graduate program. We had several dinners in private rooms, and they were all excellent.The Friday night we left, there was a singer in the bar/lounge. He sang cover songs and was very expressive. This definitely added to the enjoyable environment.There are pools - both indoor and outdoor. I did not swim in either one, but they both looked nice. There is a decent sized gym and also a spa for those that choose to partake. All in all, this was a luxurious hotel. The staff was very helpful.

All the advantages you would expect of a 5-star, including a fantastic pool, good food and pleasant staff.For the tourist traveller, it may be an idea to find something closer into town as there is very little of interest in the immediate vacinity (apart from an excellent restaurant 100 yards down the road) although, in fairness, Nicosia is only a small town and the Old Town can be reached in about 20 minutes by foot. One advantage of the location is that it is on the main road out of town, which means you can drive to a decent beach in less than an hour without any of the traffic hassles of getting out of the city.",The Landmark Nicosia
