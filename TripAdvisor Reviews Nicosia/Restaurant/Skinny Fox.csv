10,"We ate there three weeks ago .Nice environment but unfortunately the waiter was not properly trained .He couldn’t open the bottle of water with his hands so he helped himself with his T-shirt.He was also not aware of the wine they had .Getting to our plates ... the duck buns had a bone in them which unfortunately we discovered it in a awkward way.The royal crab had a very intense fishy smell, like tuna or as if it was spoiled ...this made the head waitress(not our waiter ) wonder I guess and she came to ask about it because we didn’t eat the dish .The rest of the dishes where quite indifferent.Value for money below zero.",Skinny Fox
40,An all-time favourite right in the heart of Nicosia that combines exquisite flavours with an elegant ambiance. The new outdoor seating area is absolutely charming and in line with Skinny Fox’s beautiful decor! I highly recommend the raw salad.,Skinny Fox
50,"The service was great, the location excellent, the food amazing. Will definitely visit again. (I could have the beef carpaccio every day)",Skinny Fox
50,"It was a nice experience with business partners from abroad who enjoyed it. Nice dishes, tasty and unique Good wine and helpful staff",Skinny Fox
50,"Amazing food, beautiful atmosphere, excellent service. The risotto with the truffle was superb! I totally recommend it.",Skinny Fox
10,no special menu or theme. just overpriced and overrated food for any business meeting expensed by the company,Skinny Fox
20,"I visited for dinner with a friend as we had heard great things. We booked last minute and were offered either a table in the smoking area, or place at the bar. As we are non smokers we opted for the bar. Upon arriving we were very kindly told that we could have a normal table which we accepted. However, what I didn't realise at the time was that there is no real divide between the smoking and non smoking sections of this restaurant. In fact, there is a distinct smell of smoke as soon as you walk in because of this.The next table from us (barely half a meter away) was in the smoking area and so rest assured once the people dining at that table arrived and began to smoke, it pretty much ruined our dinner. Fortunately we were almost finished and so we promptly ordered the bill and left.It's a real shame as the food was great, but if you are a non smoker be warned, you may well be sat next to somebody smoking all over your dinner, which to be honest, is just horrible.",Skinny Fox
40,"Very good food, high price but worth it. There is not a big variety in the menu but satisfies all tastes.",Skinny Fox
50,Great quality food but prices are high. You taste what you pay. Worth the money. (Ordered the Asian Pork Loin - highly recommended!),Skinny Fox
40,"Whoever did the interior design for this restaurant did a great job - I fell in love with it's ""Asia meets jazz club"" vibe. And the same Asian cuisine references in the modern Western menu. Great variety of salads and starters. Totally loved their crab-avocado starter. Plenty of gluten free choices. Friendly staff.A nice break for your taste buds when tired from traditional tavern foods.",Skinny Fox
40,"Very nice ambiance, good food, one of the few places in nicosia with good food so far, the drings need a little something still, but everything else is just right.",Skinny Fox
50,"I be been visiting this restaurant regularly over the last year. It's a very nice place to be as a couple, with friends on the bar, and also with family for lunch over weekends. One of the best food in Nicosia, excellent steak, duck buns, crispy tuna, foie grass. Excellent service and ambience. It is an expensive restaurant but is it worth it. It is excellent in its class.",Skinny Fox
40,It is not the first time I’m visiting this place. The atmosphere was good and the service as well. The carpaccio was delicious as well as the beef fillet which was cooked well. Nice place to be if you are in Nicosia. The prices are higher than other places on average it will cost you around 30 eur per person (average plate price is around 25 euro),Skinny Fox
30,"Trendy place but menu was very limited and slightly overpriced, only small bottled beers than can be sold at a premium. Disappointed that the outside and inside area are basically one with the big French windows open so the outside smoking basically all came inside as well...",Skinny Fox
30,We went for after work drinks around 1830 we were the first in the place. Didn't mind that it was empty but the kitchen didn't open till 1930 so we couldn't order something to nibble on with our drinks. The waiter was polite and brought us some peanuts. Ill go again as the cocktails are great but later to have something to eat with the cocktails,Skinny Fox
10,"The ambiance is very agressive : loud music with obsessive beat, dark red on the wall with an incohérente decoration. The food is OK but not brillant considering the very high prices of the menu. Total lack of courtesy : I have found a fly in my wine and the didn't even offer a glass. First and last time we come here.",Skinny Fox
30,"went once, food service ambiance is one of the busy places in Nicosia need to reserve in advance Visited the place with my wife. variety of food (Okiiiish), nicely decorated place. Overrated",Skinny Fox
40,"Visited the place with special guest. Delicious food, nicely decorated place. I strongly recommend it. Definitely I would revisit the place.",Skinny Fox
50,"have been there a few times everything was perfect, food service ambiance is one of the busy places in Nicosia need to reserve in advance",Skinny Fox
50,I was there for a business dinner and really enjoyed both the food and the wine.Excellent food quality and great environment for a business dinner.,Skinny Fox
10,It's so poor. From the service to the food to the lack of attention to any details. It's as though they tried to imagine what good food might taste like and went with that regardless of the end result. This is a classic Nicosia establishment in the sense that it is well below average in every department but is always fully booked because the locals want to be seen there. Never going back and neither would anyone who actually has any appreciation of what a good dining experience is.,Skinny Fox
10,"Really disappointed. Risotto was overcooked , reminded me a soup instead. Pasta seafood also overcooked and tasteless. Duck buns ok , salad overpriced and didn’t not even had a dressing. Overall a pricey restaurant, doesn’t worth going there.",Skinny Fox
30,"If you are a regular you will get the full attention, otherwise you struggle a bit, plus the waiters can be arrogant. Nice atmosphere, always busy, reservation is a must. Food is good but not consistent.",Skinny Fox
30,"I was told that this is one of the best places for dinner in Nicosia and was going there with this in my mind.The place is very nice, modern with very nice tapestry in the walls. It brought me memories of Japan maybe because of the flowers in the wall.The food was very good but not something extraordinary. The sea food pasta was nice cooked but missing the sea food. 2-3 shrimps and 2-3 rings of squid.The service was good but the food was overpriced!In general it was good but some people were smoking near me and I had the smell of cigarette. Also for some reason it was very noisy!!! Sometimes I couldn’t hear the people sitting next to me.",Skinny Fox
50,"and interesting salads,in a cosy and trendy restaurant.Service was fine although all tables were booked.Quality crowd!",Skinny Fox
40,"A very particular place, with tapestry on the walls, warm lighting and one of the best services. A rather menu but with very interesting choices. Dishes were a great blend of tastes, delicious, not at all heavy. A bit pricey but the tastes are worth it.",Skinny Fox
40,"I really liked their interior design. Moreover, they had excellent service. However, their portions are too small and they are a bit overpriced. On the other hand, they have a very good taste. Too gourmet for me!",Skinny Fox
10,"I was looking forward to visiting this restaurant last Friday, and when I called to reserve I was told that if I came exactly at 7.30 then I could stay until 9.15!Anyway, I arrived at 7.30 sharp with a friend and was greeted by 2 waiters who told me I had to leave by 9.00. Despite the rude greeting I remained cheerful. After sitting and waiting for 15 minutes, the waiters came and told us that the kitchen didn’t open until 8! My smile was diminishing as I replied that we were asked to arrive at 7.30, and I will not be leaving at 9 then. They were very quick to respond that they could move us to the smoking section of the room ( Which by the way is illegal!) I replied that I definitely would not be sitting near any smokers! There was no partition between the smokers and non smokers by the way!After waiting a further 15 minutes some bread arrived accompanied with a tiny bowl of oil. I asked the waitress if she could be kind enough to bring a little balsamico to which she replied ‘what’s that? No we don’t have any!’Did you really need to come to this awful pretentious place asked my friend? 8.30 our starter arrived and at the great dismay of the waiter! we ordered the crispy tuna and not the huge duck buns he was promoting! Yes the very tiny slices would ensure that our starter was consumed in a flash!The clock was ticking, it was 10 minutes before 9 and our main course hadn’t arrived! We only had 10 minutes left before they would throw us in a whirlwind of smoke or out of the front door. This is how stressed I was, it was a nightmare. I was thinking to myself ‘No wonder they call this place Skinny Fox! After sitting for over 1 and a half hours and only served a morsel, I felt like a Skeletal Fox!’Finally a few minutes before 9 the Fillet steak (one of the most expensive dishes on the menu arrived together with my seafood pasta. In all my years of eating fillet steak in some of the worlds best restaurants and steakhouses, I have never been served a fillet steak cut up in 3 shriveled up pieces, over cooked on the outside! It was horrendous. Horrible mushy vegetables on the side without any potatoes or rice.My dish was even worse. I can safely say that it was the worst pasta and meal I ever had. I expected a variety of seafood, but there were 4 raw prawns and 4 pieces of old tiny squid which tasted so bad that I was sick for two days after leaving this restaurant.The food was so disgusting that we were able to depart before 9.15 and spared ourselves being howled at by the rude waiters that they needed our table!Management is clearly non existent in this establishment and the unfriendly staff have no idea about customer service and customer respect. Disaster from start to finish. Steer clearP. S. I didn’t rate this place with one star even!! But to proceed I had to reluctantly give them 1!!!",Skinny Fox
50,One of the most nicely decorated bar restaurants in Nicosia with an amazing bar and the most creative dishes! One of the best for its category.,Skinny Fox
40,"The decoration and ambiance of this place is very well done, it is a place to be for the ambient, the music, drinks and food. All is very fresh and with good variety of options.The service is efficient, friendly and with good speed.The smoking in the closed terrace area could be annoying for some people.",Skinny Fox
50,It is not the first time I visited this place and I am never disappointed.... the duck was delicious and the carpaccio and duck bun were tasty. The Service was good too. Always full of people ... better to reserve before going mainly during the week end and at night ...,Skinny Fox
50,A place where the most demanding customers can find all to their satisfaction. Expensive but worth it.,Skinny Fox
50,"An elegant restaurant with a cozy atmosphere, offering excellent food and cocktails. Suitable for a special occasion. Do not miss when in Nicosia.",Skinny Fox
50,"Great food, great service... 2 bottles of champagne, Macallan 18 and Macallan 21 - it's going to be a great night !",Skinny Fox
40,"The atmosphere at this place is great, very trendy chic with attracting a late 20s to late 40s crowd. Service very good. A little bit on the pricey side, but it's expected at such a resto. Improvements can be made in terms of having more vegetarian/vegan starters, as there were no dairy-free starters. and could have more options for a vegan/vegetarian main meal for those who don't eat meat/fish or are fasting. They create really good food, so I'm sure if they put more such options, they would be well executed and well welcomed",Skinny Fox
50,We love this place and visit every time we are in Nicosia. The seared tuna and the buns are to die for!,Skinny Fox
10,"It might be a hot spot of fine dining in the capital right now but what's that worth when they don't have a true non-smokers' area? Really disappointed, bearing in mind the price we've paid for our family dinner. We complained to the waiters twice (as some members of our our family are asthmatics) but they didn't seem to evaluate the situation adequately. Plus they let some clients smoke regular and artificial cigarettes right next to our table. Not a wise management.",Skinny Fox
50,"Being a regular since it first opened a couple of years ago skinny fox has a very complete yet diverse food and drinks menu which gets slighty reshuffled every couple of months. Ambience and service are top notch, making this place the obvious option for anyone looking for a pleasant evening in Nicosia.",Skinny Fox
50,"One of the best choices for business lunches in Nicosia. An amazing decoration, a very clean restaurant and an extremely nice and friendly staff. The service was just perfect and the food delicious.",Skinny Fox
50,"The staff is extremely friendly, the alcohol is really good and reasonably priced.Food comes in big portions, tastes really good, and the staff are happy to amend dishes in case you ask them to.The only issue is the ""smoking area"" is located inside the restaurant, just in a more ""open"" area, but this is not something ""unique"" to this restaurants, since Cyprus is very ""smoking friendly"" country, and they don't really have proper ""smoking free"" areas in restaurtans.",Skinny Fox
50,Nicely decorated restaurant with a good atmosphere. The pork tendorlean was tasty as well as the duck bun and the lobster ravioli ... service was good too. I recommend this place,Skinny Fox
50,Great choice for business lunches and much more. Nice decor and a clean restaurant. The service was very good and the food delicious.,Skinny Fox
50,"The crab salad is addicting and I drive from Limassol to Nicosia atleast once a month for it! I recommend getting all of the Asian style starters and sharing them, the crispy tuna and duck buns are great!",Skinny Fox
50,"We was invited by family to the skinny fox and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food, Place was a bit dark and hard to see the menu due to limited lighting especially if you’re sitting outside under the canopy. But from other reviews I read prior to going about who’s who and a place to be seen, It all makes sense. Though if I could eat a duck bun every day for the next year I would, They are to die for, fresh, tasty and just delicious. Our main course was good, and our whole group seemed to enjoy it tooWould I go back........ Most certainly, especially due to that duck buns",Skinny Fox
50,"Excellent choice of dishes, all very tasty and great wine. Service was impeccable. Loved the duck buns, crispy tuna and Moroccan salad.",Skinny Fox
10,"The ambience was okay, beautiful floors, wallpaper okay, but the art over crowded the walls. This over abundance mixed with dance music and smoking permitted inside, didn't make for a pleasant environment to dine in. The server was pompous and arrogant, yet he served a cold bottle of red wine. An elegant establishment would never serve a red wine cold! This is basic knowledge. This was a clear indication that the restaurant was of a lower class than it portrayed. The food was okay, the chef did not know how to balance the flavors incorporated in the dishes. One of the worst restaurants I have been to, and over priced. Save your money.",Skinny Fox
30,"Visited on a Wednesday night, quite busy for mid-week, but had managed to book a table for 4 approx two days before, requesting a NON smoking table. Upon arrival we were greeted by a grumpy front of house who seated us at a table set for 5 people... in the smoking section... and then was nowhere to be seen.As far as the food goes, we ordered the Moroccan salad and Duck steam buns for starters, both of which were excellent. We tried 4 different mains; pulled pork, prawn spaghetti, corvina fish and calamari risotto, which were all delicious. Waiting staff were very friendly and helpful.The selection of mains was slightly limited, but apparently they are in the process of changing the menu.Overall, not sure if I'll be returning..",Skinny Fox
30,"...and enjoy good food, then this is the place for you.But it is loud, service can be a bit slow, and because one wall is open to the outside you will be enduring smokers. And if you are “lucky” enough to have four obnoxious cigar smokers close by....then you can imagine.Regarding the food, quality is there and so is consistency (we have been 3-4 times over a period of a year). Risottos are very tasty, the rib eye is great and from the starters the tartar is good albeit a bit salty.And this is one of the few places in Nicosia that has my favorite vodka (Tito’s) on their bar shelf.",Skinny Fox
20,"Enjoyed our dinner at Skinny Fox. Very popular. Excellent food. The quality has not only remained high, it had improved, I would say. The restaurant is enjoyable and the service very personalized. Our waiter remembered us from a previous visit ! Relaxed atmosphere but very noisy environment with rather loud background music. Would recommend.",Skinny Fox
40,Went to Skinny Fox for first time. Don't know what I was expecting but was a little disappointed. Food was lovely and very tasty though menu very limited for me as a vegetarian but portions simply not enough left feeling hungry and cocktails were on the weak side and glass only just over half full. Music felt repetitive. Ambience was very nice and staff were very helpful though when we asked for coffee could only offer us espresso after 11.30pm!,Skinny Fox
50,"Had dinner for two this week, the service was excellent:very polite, attentive staff who had good knowledge of the menu and ingredients. We had the pesto ceviche for starter, which was tasty but different to the original Peruvian dish. But it was the main dish that was rich in taste, interesting and superior to most other restaurants in the city. The prices are definitely higher than most but depict the high standards they set for themselves. The place itself is nicely decorated with a living-room feeling but was a little bit louder than i would wish for a romantic dinner. Overall, a great find in Nicosia,will definitely be back soon to try mor of their menu! Very refreshing!",Skinny Fox
50,"Excellent in every way. Service, food originality and quality! Lovely atmosphere and heavenly food and cocktails. Cannot recommend it enough. A must if you are visiting Nicosia !",Skinny Fox
50,"busy, trending beautiful crowd, excellent food! every place is very well thought and served. choose to share dishes to get to try many things. lunch is more quiet and still great.",Skinny Fox
40,"We had a dinner party on a Monday night in July. We were sat in the sun under the awning but were okay with it knowing the sun would be down shortly. Once the sun was down they pulled the awning back to allow a bit more air flow. It was fine and some gust would allow the A/C to circulate our way. We asked for a non-smoking section and where we sat allowed for good circlulation of air. Cocktails and food were excellent. I do recomment the Spaghetti with truffle. The seafood one was good too. Yes, a bit pricey and the reason for the 4 stars. I haven't been too happy with a lot of restaurants in Nicosia, but this one has impressed me with the quality of food. It says a lot when a restaurant is hopping after 8 on a Monday night.",Skinny Fox
40,"The interior and food are exceptional. Cocktails are well prepared and the food is delicious. This place has a quite big choice of wines, so if you are a wine-lover or a fancy wine-lover, you need to check it out. Been there many times and will visit this place again soon. Why 4 stars, but not 5? Because myself and my friends already mentioned, that the food is a bit too salty. And this saltiness does not go anywhere :) Food is delicious and it looks amazing on the plate, but you really want to taste less salt.The menu is small and it has not changed for a while... as a result, a lot of my friend skip Skinny Fox now..can not disagree... It would be nice to see a new menu at Skinny Fox.",Skinny Fox
50,"Reading the reviews below I was abit concerned however I decided to bite the bullet bullet...Conclusion: ""Haters gonna hate""The restaurant is TOP NOTCH we have tried many starters, cocktails and wine.The portions are excellent. You are not expected to dine with just the main dish, in Cyprus many consider starters not being part of the dining experience and skip them directly to mains.We had scallops,beef tartare and beef carpaccio paired with Barafakas red and Pulled Pork for mains.We finished with some cocktails. The Old Fashioned is highly recommended.Definitely worth visiting there are not many competitors to contest Skinny Fox, prices are what you would expect from a fine dining restaurant.There are many fast foods around if you are on a budget.",Skinny Fox
40,"Skinny fox is by far one of the best places to have lunch in the heart of Nicosia. The atmosphere is very nice, although a bit to heavy on the decorations But the food is EXCELLENT!!! Will definitely be back soon!!!",Skinny Fox
50,"Lovely interior design with excellent food. The daily specials are obviously special as they tend to sell out very quickly, so get your order in fast!",Skinny Fox
20,"We had made reservation before 4 days of our visit to celebrate the birthday of my friend plus we had ordered a small birthday cake for him to blow the candles ! We came on the spot and they denied everything although we showed to them the confirmation email ... anyway they gave us a table after all with no cake ... The food is terrible , the crab salad had so much coriander that haunted the crab meat and the rest of the vegs, the meat fillet was not that fresh with some peculiar heavy ... taste , the fish fillet was good,but nothing special and thank god that I had separated it from the sauces and the dolma of lobster .... the service is so terrible for such an expensive restaurant , we had to be served the wine and the water by ourselves...",Skinny Fox
30,"Before I move on to the negatives, I must say that the FOOD IS AMAZING, the chef and the kitchen staff does an excellent job consistently, I was never disappointed by the food in any of my visits there.However, the front of the house is simply unacceptable. I visited today for lunch when the restaurant was at 10% capacity max without reservation and they sat us ""outside"" (it's an exposed area which is covered by plastics, so there is no aircondition and no natural air from outside). When we aked if we could be sat inside due to the heat they were adamant that all tables were booked.We ordered fairly moderate amount of food for two (two salads and one main), but due to the heat (Nicosia during summer time at noon without aircondition, you get the picture) we could not finish the food. When asked to pack the food for takeaway after asking the bill we were told that they the restaurant doesn't have a take-away license (whatever that means) so they couldn't give us the food we had already PAID FOR to take home.Even if this excuse does not stand in legal terms (I paid for the food which made it my property, hence enabling me to do what I wish with it) and a license is indeed required, this is exactly the job of the restaurant's management, to get those licenses...I've never been denied to take away my unfinished food anywhere in the world or in Cyprus. But I guess different rules apply to this establishment.Although, as I mentioned above, the food and the decor is amazing I will never be visiting this establishment again because I want to spend my hard earned money on people who respect their clients.",Skinny Fox
50,Located in Nicosia. The food was delicious mainly the sea bass and also all the starters that we took duck bun etc the service was quick. The restaurant is modern and well decorated. I recommend. Nice ambiance too,Skinny Fox
40,I went there after a local suggested it and I was really impessed. Very nice mediterranean cuisine and lots of gourmet choises. Staff service was nice. It is on the pricey side but i suggest it.,Skinny Fox
50,The salads are really good! Best mozzarella i have had for years! Also the chicken dish was amazing. I definitely recommend it for lunch!,Skinny Fox
10,"Although the interior design of the restaurant looks very nice, it is very expensive restaurant and the menu needs a lot of improvement. For those who are vegetarians/vegans the choices are very limited. Staff service was poor. The quality of the food is perfect but the problem is that the prices are very high.",Skinny Fox
30,"Went because it has been very hyped. In the essence of it however, the food, I can't say it met expectations. Marrocan salad was so full of vinegar, we could not taste anything else. Pulled pork was done nicely, best thing we tasted. Mushroom risotto is a safe choice. Drinks were well done but quantity ridiculously small. Try it out, maybe it's just not for me!",Skinny Fox
30,The food is kinda fake gourmet and the portions are very small. At least I liked the crispy tuna and the green salad. Deserts were also good. Don’t try the lobster cannelloni cause it’s totally not worth it. In general it’s overpriced and snobbish and I get the sense this is the character it wants to promote. Of course there is a certain class but in general they cannot pull off the gourmet part.,Skinny Fox
50,"This place is a unique inspiration of the food philosophy and the service level. Each of the service staff want to serve and is happy to be in assistance of any need of the guest. Between the service care when I get my meal in front of me I get indulged into taste mood breathing the flavor in. New menu is nice and attractive for the summer mood of the city. It is a pleasure to visit the place to feel a guest, not a customer. Thank you.",Skinny Fox
50,"In Nicosia on business and we were hosted at the Skinny Fox.What an experience!Duck Buns must not be missed; created from scratch in the kitchen, delicious.Followed with the best medium rare fillet steak I’ve had in a long time; well ahead of London or Paris.My first time in Nicosia and we will be back.Superb service and friendly management were the icing on them cake. Well worth a visit!",Skinny Fox
40,"Eating at 2pm just 6 other diners nice reception and attentive service.We ordered scallops with parsnip puree very good indeed though im no sure about the box with pebbles and assorted bits it was served on. A reasonable bottle of chablis was fine.Maincourse fillet of beef and fish was well executed though not very hot. Dessert lemon curd with meringue and strawberry sorbet. Well meringue rock hard,lemon curd more pastry cream with a hint of lemon but the sorbet was excellent .",Skinny Fox
50,"a rather vintage looking restaurant with a homey ambiance and vibe, reminds you of your grandmothers house, in a good way! automatically feel relaxed in this environment, the lighting is perfect and the bar gives character to the place... the waiters are helpful and smiley, the service is not the best thats because they definitely need more staff! the Bar men are very knowledgeable with original cocktails or if you are a fuss pot like me, they can whip up something for your palette!the food is to die for!!!!!!!!!! the salads come in huge portions! i suggest you order a salad and about 4-5 starters if you are 2 persons! the main dishes are nothing special or original BUT the starters!!! wow!!! i just want to eat everything every time i go! trust me you will not regret it!if you are looking for quantity unfortunately you wont find it here because this place serves QUALITY food! my favourites include the seafood salad (enough to share), seafood kaneloni (enough for 1 person only) , seared crispy tuna tataki (enough to share), prawn dumplings, scallops and dessert!!!! the chocolate mousse!!!!!!!!!",Skinny Fox
30,A very popular place and as such is very noisy. Some dishes are good but some are truly average and very pricey. It is not value for money. Expensive wines are not decanted.,Skinny Fox
10,"Last night i understood why this place is called Skinny Fox.Because if you go there and eat you will become skinny. They have the smallest portions not enough even for a small child. The service was terrible, very slow and with huge delays. Big plates with a little bit of food in the middle. All plates were full of garlic and in general there was a terrible smell of garlic everywhere in the restaurant. The music was very loud so we couldnt talk to each other (a group of 6 girls). The only thing we liked was the decoration. As a result we paid €30 each and left totally hungry and SKINNY!",Skinny Fox
40,One of the best gourmet restaurant in town. Great food excellent service. You have to try duck for starter. The best. The only bad thing is the small main dishes. But everything in excellent taste. Machalepi is the best idea to finish you dinner..,Skinny Fox
30,"Excellent food, amongst the very best in Nicosia, the fish was superb ... unfortunately the separation of smokers and non-smokers is a mockery ... what a shame",Skinny Fox
50,Tasty food: starters are very tasty and well presented. My preferred main course is the steak with foie gras... delicious. Service sometimes slow but the waitress are always ready to assist you. I recommend.,Skinny Fox
30,The food was average with limited choice. There is no way that a person with allergies or special dietary requests can eat here. Too greasy food served as gourmet,Skinny Fox
40,It's apparently very difficult to get a table (my friends had booked on a weekday and were joyous for their achievement). Offers modern fusion cuisine which is not easy to come across in Cyprus. We tried several dishes - all of which well executed. Service was fine but one could see it could easily tip over if it was a tad busier,Skinny Fox
50,"So, intrigued with the name of the place, I felt the need to check out this restaurant. If you are looking for a different dining experience, this is it. Tony was the cordial and friendly manager with the great smile. Menu choices are interesting and the food was flavorful. Very casual dining. When the weather is warm, there is outside seating. We visited there twice. The second visit was later on a Friday evening. They were a little slower service wise and out of some main ingredients, so you might want to go early to avoid that. I guess this is actually a chain in Vegas. We were at the one on 215 and Decatur. Check out the pineapple barbecue sauce- Yumilicious!",Skinny Fox
40,"Its a very good choice for lunch in the heart of Nicosia. I recommend their salad starters, but you can find something for everyone.",Skinny Fox
40,"The restaurant is ok, the bar is great with a huge choice of Gin.But, the reason why you must go there is because Costas (the manager) has created a place to be.Female friends having diner without husbands, male friends doing the same.If everyone knows everyone in Nicosia (!!!) the place has concentrated a Cypriot posh group of local people. If you are looking for an Appart or office for rent, ask Costas about the « Chicken Girl », ex star of the poultry market... you will meet the kind of pro suggested locally :(",Skinny Fox
50,"We've been here several times and we liked all food that we've tried. Salad with tuna, pasta, tar-tar, grilled dorada etc. - everything was good and tasty. Be aware of a bit higher prices than average. Nice and impressive decor, polite and friendly staff.",Skinny Fox
30,"This place is really skinny ... All the doors are open, so there is no difference between smoking or not smoking area, it is not the best choice if you are with a pregnant lady.Waitress was very rude, no one was looking after our table.Food was excellent, nice presentation.Won't rush to go back, the place has nothing special. It is just TRENDY.",Skinny Fox
40,We went for lunch and enjoyed the fresh ingredients and execution. We enjoyed all the dishes we ordered (except for the dumplings). It was pricey though (but commensurate with a more upscale type dining) and worth the price.,Skinny Fox
40,"The food was excellent and the service too. The decoration of the place is such a pleasure to the eye and we really liked it. I have to say that I was impressed as to how clean the toilets were (!!) and the only negative remark I need to make is that even though we did not notice while we were there, smoking is allowed in some tables, having as a result our clothes to smell.",Skinny Fox
50,"My personal opinion is that this is the best restaurant in Nicosia at the moment! Excellent food, great coctails and a great atmosphere! Can't ask for more!",Skinny Fox
20,"The food was very good (tuna starter, fillet steak main), although very overpriced. But it's ruined by the fact that several tables were full of people smoking. It's 2017 and I'm pretty sure this is illegal (even in Cyprus...) and if not, it should be! My clothes still stink.",Skinny Fox
20,"If you are a vegetarian i do not suggest to visit this restaurant. The only vegetarian options are 2 salads and 1 main dish!!! Not even a single dish in their “starters menu” is suitable for vegetarians. Also this place is only good for smokers. The smoking and non-smoking area is divided by an invisible wall?? I mean it is just ridiculous!! I would’n visit this restaurant again. However, to be fair, the food was ok and the dessert was very tasty. Service was just ok.",Skinny Fox
40,"Visited this place last week for business dinner while in Nicosia.It's a really nice place, the decoration and setup makes you feel comfortable and warm.Have to say that the food is amazing, duck buns are exceptional and Chicken Beriani delicious (star of the night).Wine is very tasty as well.All in all a great experience and would go back as soon as back in Cyprus",Skinny Fox
30,My second visit to this restaurant & I don't think I shall return. As before service was extremely slow-45 minutes to deliver 2 simple desserts . Main courses were OK.We were all really upset when just before our desserts were delivered smoke from some clients cigars was blown our way . The smokers were sitting in what looked like an Indoor smoking area complete with ash trays on the tables. How legal is this? Altogether a disappointing visit.,Skinny Fox
50,What a find .....the food was exceptional. We had a selection of starters and one main meal and it was all delicious. Service was without fault. Would highly recommend.,Skinny Fox
30,"I visited the place for lunch in December .Even when we called for the reservation, the employees were not helpful or very polite.The waiter who served us gave us the impression that he was in a hurry to serve us, eat and leave.The 5 dishes we ordered were nothing special and definitely not value for money.Even when we paid and getting ready to leave the restaurant, no one of the employees put any effort even to say thank you or goodbye.In general, if you are a world traveler and you enjoy good service and quality food, you will understand that this restaurant has a way to go.",Skinny Fox
30,I was expecting something considerable better considering the price of the food and the visual appearance from outside. The food was average and the staff unhelpful and very slow. The waiter brought our drinks just ahead of the food which was a let down and when we commented he just shrugged,Skinny Fox
50,Business dinner with a nice Ribeye steak...exceptional side dishes and an excellent red wine...enjoyable evening...highly recommended when you are in Nicosia center.,Skinny Fox
20,"Nothing special about the food, really slow service, and unacceptable mix-up with smokers! So sad...",Skinny Fox
10,"The smokers’ and non-smokers’ part are together and form one big connected space. The window doors that were supposed to separate them were removed to make space for more smokers’ tables. The cigarette smoke cannot escape to the outside because windows and a roof keep it cosy inside. The air inside becomes blue with smoke. If you are non-smoker, the only way to escape the smoke is by leaving.",Skinny Fox
40,"Warm place with nice decoration, low noise, no smoke. Good dishes and sufficient service. Would suggest to everyone who search for excellent food.",Skinny Fox
40,"Skinny fox is a very nice restaurant with interesting decoration.Went there few days ago with a friend.The food we ordered as mentioned above was excellent, every single plate. In my opinion improvements must be in place as far as concern the service! Nice touch the cocktail we ordered was served in our table by the bartender.Keep up the good work skinny fox.",Skinny Fox
50,I was really intrigued by the fact that the restaurant has no outside signs. However it is always full. is it by chance? A recent visit convinced me that this place may have one of the best menus in town. The roustique decors is quite pleasant. Has a certain upclass feel. We were a party of 10 friends.Starting with a Skinny Spritz cocktail I was already anxious to go though the gastronomic experience. Undoubtedly the duck buns are a must try and so are the scallops and garpaccio. The salads were freshly cut and rich and were well enjoyed by our gluten intolerant friend. All the food was accompanied by a nicely chilled Pinot Grigio. And then it was time for desert. We ordered the choux on hazelnut crust which were to die for and Tiramisu. The excellent food was served with care from the very polite and attentive waiters.Cant wait to visit with my husband.,Skinny Fox
50,"I had one of the best meals in cyprus! I love visiting restaurants in cyprus! The food was amazing, the service superb and the atmosphare excellent! 5 of 5 is the minimun i can rate!! Well done!! Bravo!!!",Skinny Fox
40,Liked the place a lot. Was there for a private event so I am not sure what I experienced was their daily service. Food is good; drinks the same :) Loud music for my taste. People seemed to have liked it.,Skinny Fox
50,Great food ! Great place to be . I like the atmosphere the stylish interior design . The food was tasty and I will go back again !,Skinny Fox
50,"The decorations of this relatively new establishment is really impressive, resembling a French bistro or a London stylish bar! Great music, imaginative cocktails and nicely dressed patrons, all create a beautiful atmosphere. Food is good but there is still room for improvement.",Skinny Fox
40,Located in Nicosia. Well decorated restaurant. The food is good but the service is extremely slow. The atmosphere was nice too.,Skinny Fox
50,"Skinny Fox is a trendy restaurant which plays electronic music and has stylish clientele. What impressed me most was the quality of the food. I can confidently recommend the 500g rib eye. The service is laid back, which I don't mind, and the staff are knowledgeable.",Skinny Fox
30,"We were a company of five and we dinned in skinny fox on Thursday between 21:00-00:00. Upon arrival the waitress handed to us the set f menus (food and drinks). I felt like the waiter was trying to rush us in ordering, she kept on asking if we were ready.In general the service has nothing special, is average, no formality in the way they approach the clients but no rude either. I would expect a better uniform by the waitress, males were ok. Every member of the staff were in total black, but athletic leggings i wouldn't appreciate that from a formal and promising restaurant. May the establishment of a staffs' uniform, not a dress code, would be more professional.The venue is very delicately designed, very stylish and trendy. On the background there was a jazz music which suited perfectly with the atmosphere. It is obvious that someone invested a significant amount of money in decoration with furniture and accessories that you will not see just everywhere. Thumps up to the interior design!The table set up was simple but satisfying: water glass, a good quality of an A4 paper with the logo as a mad, and cutleries for starter and main.Food wise i had more expectations. We have starters which were almost perfect as soon as we reached a hair in a Chinese bun. We had a tomato mozzarella which was perfect, a goat cheese salad which it was ok but a was disappointed to see that in the goat cheese it was high concentration of pepper. Then we had the Chinese buns which are one of the famous plates of the restaurant, they are indeed very nice but we would preferred them without hair. When we informed the waiter that in the dough we found hair she said ""I will inform my supervisor"" she came back immediately and said that they will offer this plate for free. I would expect the supervisor to come and apologize though it was not a matter of money it was a matter of hygiene. We also had a beef prosciutto which was very ok. For mains we had grilled chicken and their rib eye steak which were perfect. We also had the lobster risotto and the pulled pork both were heavily salted and the risotto with very much lemon as well. The herbs were enough to cover the taste of every raw material used in the plates. Desserts are ok but nothing special.Cocktails were super. I don't really think you are getting value for money, i would expect more for this prices. The bill came in a silver pomegranate, i liked this touch.",Skinny Fox
50,"A place to be visit. Excellent quality of food, modern presentation, tasty and we'll balanced. Good quality of ingredients, presentation and composition. Service friendly, fast and well trained.Wine and cocktail list very good, nice selection and well presented.Proud for the chefs and his team job. Well done guys.",Skinny Fox
40,"I particularly enjoyed the cool atmosphere. It is a trendy place where you see interesting faces having a nice time. I liked selected plates from the menu, as the crispy salmon and the pull pork. And this went well with a pornstar cocktail. You will enjoy!",Skinny Fox
30,"The decor is lovely, the seating arrangement and lighting all highlighting the quirky wallpaper - all very interesting. Cheese platter and drinks are fantastic. The food was average-to-good and priced accordingly (16euros+) but the service needs more training: how to keep an eye out for customers trying to catch your eye, how to serve desert menus after dinner, how to repeat an order to make sure you've got everything.Do and try get there early because it gets very busy and you'll find yourself waiting for your food, desperately waving waiters down etc. I'll definitely go again, for drinks and that yummy cheese platter.",Skinny Fox
30,"The Skinny Fox is a trendy restaurant in central Nicosia that, refreshingly, bucks the minimalist-industrial trend that has been taking over the restaurant world. Its colorful wallpapers, stacked books at the entrance, and eclectic collection of art all contribute to the atmosphere.It's clearly the spot to people-watch while nursing a cocktail (do try the Skinny Spritz - just perfect for a warm summer evening). The service is attentive, and I had no complaints.So why the average rating? I ordered the Harissa Chicken expecting flavorful poultry served on spinach rice and the rather intriguing, smoked yogurt. Instead of the punchiness of Harissa, my chicken was rather bland, and neither the rice nor the yogurt (which tasted ordinary to me) added anything of substance. My partner's excellent cod dish with a crab croquette, on the other hand, would have made a better choice. Our friends ordered the Raw Salad, which was quite a large portion but was lacking the Edamame which had promised as the star of that show - our server didn't inform them that the kitchen had run out of Edamame so we can only assume that someone forgot.It's the lack of consistency that leads me to give Skinny Fox only an Average rating. Having said that, I would go back and give it a second chance, hopefully by trying its famed duck steamed buns.",Skinny Fox
40,"Good food but could be better with some improvements in the menu, e.g. Avoid the sugar. Good advice and excellent decoration. Expensive though. Would visit again.",Skinny Fox
20,"The beef carpaccio was ok, the duck buns were very good, the rib eye was poor. But what brought this place down was the quality of the service (clueless about everything and dreadfully slow) and the fact that people smoke inside the restaurant.",Skinny Fox
50,Located at Nicosia. Nicely decorated restaurant serving tasty food; must try lobster risotto and the duck ... good service too.,Skinny Fox
40,This place reminded me of the once glamorous Buddha Bar-a bit more relaxed and not trying so hard either. Which is why I think it will last longer. The food is surprisingly good. Definitely come again....,Skinny Fox
40,"Great place to meet with your friends.Good food options (although not many) that can satisfy all pallets.Some dishes could improve but that's just my personal opinion eg the duck buns who everyone loves, I feel there's too much bun hiding the lovely taste of the duck.The service could be better especially on really busy nights.Other than that its a lovely place and the owner has this contagious positive energy all around him.",Skinny Fox
40,"We visited twice within a week. After the first visit we were very impressed with the food, specifically the mixture of the side dishes included with the mains. The Octopus/hummus on both visits was the best octopus we've had. However the food on the 2nd visit was nothing special with my wife's cod having far too much ginger causing her to simply stop eating. The decor of the place is not for us as the floor clashes with the wall paper making it feel like its trying to be something its not. Finally, although the servers are attentive and knowledgeable of the ingredients in the dishes, they come across as very disinterested in being there. Minor adjustments could make this place endure rather than be the current in place for a few years. We will probably return and do recommend eating here.",Skinny Fox
50,"Relatively a new addition to Nicosia's scene.> Very good food, with some interesting twists on classic dishes. Wine list has some good options that will satisfy almost everyone> Nice decor> Service is just ok - there is room for improvement> Prices are reasonableOverall a very good dinning option in Nicosia.",Skinny Fox
50,"Had dinner here last night (Thursday) while visiting family in Nicosia. The place for full at 8pm and we waiting 5 mins for 2 seats at the bar.The fit out has a Moroccan feel to it with a lot of thought and detail going into it that actually creates a pretty cool vibe.The menu has an asian fusion feel about it and we ordered the tuna, lobster risotto and seabass. All the dishes were well portioned and tasted great. I would certainly order the risotto again.The most impressive part for me was the bartender. Sitting at the bar is quite enjoyable as i enjoy talking for the guys behind the bar. Their rum, scotch and gin selections were top notch and his knowledge and skill were fantastic. He experimented with his own ideas to offer up variations of cocktails. The guy really has a passion for drinks and that certainly adds to the overall experience of eating at this place.Would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a casual feeling drink and meal.",Skinny Fox
50,Great food finally.... interesting fusion plates...very intriguing that i wanted to try everything! We tried quite a few and all were excellent. I totally recommend it! Service was just ok...a bit of a delay...or we booked at the bar but were seated on a table without anybody mentioning anything....I really hope the food quality remains so high after the first buzz!If you are into good food.... try it! Dont miss the beef carpaccio and the tuna!,Skinny Fox
40,"Went there with my husband for dinner and fell in love with the place. The atmosphere takes resembles a New York bar/restaurant. Modern ambiance with vintage touches in a very successful blend. Friendly staff, mouthwatering dishes, well cooked and presented. Loved it!",Skinny Fox
40,"i enjoyed the food, it was really good, the staff were very friendly the decor was beautiful. i recommend it!",Skinny Fox
40,Very nice food and cocktails. All the dishes we had were delicious. All the ingredients carefully selected made me wanna try all the menu :) Although a friendly recommendation for a better service... for such a place we expected more.,Skinny Fox
30,"Dined here with my girlfriend on a date. On entering we say there was some kind of event with people milling around drinking champagne, we did notice some local celebrities there as well.The decor made a fun change from other places in the capital, however it did not seem as organic or as hip as in similar places abroad which it seemed to be copying.The service was quite poor and detached, the staff perhaps were more concerned with the event guests and we did not feel very well taken care of.WE had the crab salad to share, I had the pulled pork and my girlfriend had the prawn pasta. The food was ok, crab salad tasted fresh although somewhat bland. The pulled pork was tasty and the pasta was cooked well. However nothing was extraordinary or rose to our high expectations.In the end the bill seemed to us unfair - for the prices asked the food does not deliver. Perhaps I am harsh in my review but this is in light of the positioning of this place as THE new hip place to be seen in. Perhaps if service is improved and the food is raised to the next level, Skinny Fox might be worth another visit",Skinny Fox
30,"Recently visited this place with friends. We had a few cocktails and dinner. Overall it had a good atmosphere and decor. The service was not very good as the waiters where not easily available. I ordered the risotto, it was ok but it was to salty and did not have a silky and creamy texture as it should. As for the food, the portions are relatively small and pricey. Some of the deserts are very nice. Overall nice atmosphere, but too pricey for what is offered.",Skinny Fox
30,"Visited this bar/restaurant place last night for a family dinner! This is a new and very popular restaurant in Nicosia bearing in mind that Nicosia offers limited options for fine dining.The decor is warm and nice, service is average food is ok but price is quite high!! Fine dining with Paper napkins ???",Skinny Fox
40,We went to skinny fox for lunch and I liked the decor of as it was not your usual contemporary feel. The menu is varied and everything we ordered was really delicious. I would like to try it in the evening to see if it has a different vibe to it but on the whole a lovely restaurant.,Skinny Fox
40,"Located in Nicosia. Well decorated restaurant. The atmosphere is good, the food acceptable (portions relatively small) as well as the cocktails.",Skinny Fox
30,"I went to Skinny Fox after good - great reviews from friends. Good atmosphere, good service and nice ambience. Place a little too crowded, tables too close together.Good selection of cocktails, a bit pricey. Table of 2 couples. We ordered starters, main and desert. Starters were salad and duck 'pitta' - amazing taste. Mains: 2 fish and pork. Fish was ok, nothing special. The pork was not that great, fatty and sauce nothing too exciting. Desert was great again. Unfortunately, it took almost 45mins for mains to arrive. Overall will probably try it one more time as there were good aspects which we look for when going out, however the jury is still out if this is a place i like.",Skinny Fox
50,The food quality is definitely above average Cyprus standards....it could be compared with good restaurants abroad something unusual for Cyprus. Even though a bit pricey I believe it is worth it not only for the food but also for the ambience. I hope it will keep up this high standard because we need such places in Cyprus! Well done guys!!!,Skinny Fox
40,"We arrive at 7 :00 pm without reservation,the restaurant was empty, they let us know that the kitchen it's opening at 8:00 pm until that we order a bottle of wine and a cheese platter! Only 2 2 types of cheese ( kefalotiry and yellow chedar) grapes and a jam they brot us some bread ( not home made) for dinner we had beef tartare which was good , black Angus ribeye for main , millefeuille and chocolate cake for dessert! Overall food was pretty good worth the experience! The service otherwise was lame, the most shirt service ever meet in Nicosia over the years! Hope they will to something about that soon otherwise will loose customers",Skinny Fox
20,We had for dinner several of their plates including the two risottos and two different salads. We were waiting for more than 1 hour for our food. One of the plates never arrived. The food quality was worse than average! Not visiting again here!,Skinny Fox
30,Visited the place with high expectations!! We could not find a parking place! - when i asked for the designated parking place they told me they had none!! . Second disappointment - they did not have non-alcoholic beer! - then i asked for tonic water and they brought me a no-brand tonic water! Please!Food was ok to good - i had fillet - deserts were good and after that we asked for nuts and they did have. Good quality ones.Music was a bit loud but expectedGood crowd,Skinny Fox
40,"Casual lunch with friends. Decent wine list at reasonable prices. The dishes we tried we all very good. The dolma as a starter was delicious and easy to share. The taliatelle with shrimps, sea bass and halibut were all tasty. Service was good and the place overall very cost and clean. Thoroughly recommended.",Skinny Fox
40,Amazing place to be. A very well designed restaurant and bar. Lovely atmosphere and delicious food! Service needs to be improved!,Skinny Fox
50,A lovely restaurant beautifully decorated with friendly staff and lovely food!! The food is mouthwatering you should get the steak absolutely delicious!!!,Skinny Fox
40,"Refined dishes, unique decor and professional service. Unfortunately it gets very crowded on weekends and the music is turned on too loud.",Skinny Fox
30,"I visit the place last night for a girls night out !Warm atmosphere nice music!Food was good,gourmet plates small portions as it should be and very delicious!Good selection of wines and coctails! Service a little bit slow!All good but nothing new or special to make me a regular customer.",Skinny Fox
40,"Food is gourmet but the right quantity, not too much and not too little.Excellent food, when eaten is as though it is a ritual. Very talented chef. Should come out and speak to the guests.Limited choices but there is something for all tastes.Found the decor with the books very nice but not the combination of dark floor with the orange cause there was not enough lighting for me.We also chose a dessert which was excellent!!! Mille Feuille not to be missed!!I would have to agree about the service. It is not at all bad but slow but then there were only two waiters for the whole restaurant...............",Skinny Fox
50,"Great food very well presented, very good selection of wines priced sensibly, good service, reasonable prices. What is really good though is that this is a very vivid place, Jazzy, fizzy and with the right crowd. If I had to include a negative comment I would say that the decoration is slightly overdone. Make sure to have a reservation.",Skinny Fox
40,"Concise and delicious menu from start to finish. We opted to try it for lunch when they would be less busy. Very happy with that decision.Service was timely but a few faults, not a big deal but for the price service should really be flawless. (forgetting drinks, serving other table your dish etc. ok it happens.)The layout of the restaurant means smokers sit next to the indoor area, this is an issue and they need to fix this. It smells like a pub. Cigar smoker was the only bad thing but really a minus point.Food executed well and worth the price. Cornfed chicken juicy, full of savoury flavours, lobster risotto citrusy and satisfying. Duck buns would benefit from addition of fresh coriander. Not a fan of the rose sorbet, but that could be personal taste. Desserts were the perfect size for sharing. Definitely going back for lunch to try other dishes. Really well done.",Skinny Fox
40,"Great food, dolmades and fillet steak, both very good, service was poor considering their price point, food justifies price though. Nice atmosphere but service needs to be more on point and with a smile please :)",Skinny Fox
30,Was impressed with the food although starters came at different times and were late coming. However the tasty food was ruined with the fact that people started smoking inside. We had to complain to waiter who decently asked them to stop smoking and of course we got dirty looks for the rest of the night. Allowing smoking inside is inexcusable.,Skinny Fox
50,"Creative, tasty, quality, good vibes, good food, pleasantly surprised by chef ability to cook chicken just moist, tartare au couteau, as it should, and everything else with a twist. If you care about food, must do. If you want Tavern food, stay away :-)",Skinny Fox
50,"finally i managed to get a table at this new restaurant in town that i heard so much about.We arrived early 8.30 so we ordered our food before it got really busy so i can say service was quite good. The food was really good, the ambiance even better. I loved the music and the decor, service was good and the food delicious. I think its probably the best in town at the moment but you need to make a reservation way before",Skinny Fox
40,"I have been in this restaurant a couple of times, the décor and the atmosphere are quite good towards very good. The food is very good with the exception of a few dishes. However, the big problem is the slow and inefficient service!! I would think that this should have been spotted by now and corrected, but alas no!",Skinny Fox
20,"And that ruined the whole experience of course!! And we didn't even have lunch or dinner ! (We would probably beg them to bring our food before midnight!)We went in the afternoon for coffee -the place wasn't heaving- and ordered 2 teas and a cappuccino! We waited almost 20 mins to get menus and almost 20 more to bring them!All the staff was busy talking -arguing actually- about the evening seating arrangement and they didn't care about the customers who were already there! the small mugs came with hot water half full (?) for the teas, (and brought the wrong tea bags) and when my friend asked 3 waiters for extra hot water, one came 20 mins later (classic) saying they didn't have tea pots so they could take our mugs in the kitchen, fill them with water and bring them back! What??The deco is nice and inspiring but that's about it! Will not bother to visit again! Service and respect is one of my top priorities when I visit a restaurant and in this one I had neither!",Skinny Fox
40,"New arrival in Nicosia, where you can combine good food and drinks. I would include it on the pricey side although we were very pleased with the quality of the food, the décor and the general atmosphere. I will go there again and I do recommend it to others. You have to book well in advance since it is always packed.",Skinny Fox
20,"Waited one hour for the arrival of a salad to share and another 20 minutes after that for our main courses. It arrived quite cold. Not just that, the service in general was slow for drinks too. Dissapointed considering the reputation and pricing of the restaurant.",Skinny Fox
30,"Visited this recently opened restaurant last month for lunch. Quite a pleasing atmosphere but very limited menu. Portions are quite small. My pasta sauce was excellent & my friend's salad was good. Service was a little slow. However, my ""salad eating"" friend returned for dinner some days later & was very dissatisfied. The restaurant was full & the staff were totally unable to cope. She had to ask three times for some water & she ordered the same salad S before and said it was terrible. Lunch & dinner menus are the same very limited options. It's a good location so I hope they get their act together soon.",Skinny Fox
40,"Outstanding dinner in Nicosia. Nice atmosphere, good service and the most important very nice quality of food. Very nice plate presentation and the best taste. Had tried the fillet steak, chicken and halibut for main, and tuna , Iranian dolmades and salad for starters. Accompanied with a nice Chilean Merlot.Finished with fantastic desserts.Highly recommended .",Skinny Fox
50,"Delicious food, great ambiance, great service with a smile. The Chocolat Noix is unmistakably superb.",Skinny Fox
40,"Nice atmosphere. Some of the food is great - in my opinion the best dish was the beef tagliata, the cooking of the meat was perfect. We also liked the prawn pasta, as well as the duck buns (from the starter menu).The only issues are the slow service - especially on Saturday nights where the restaurant is full, we had to wait for a long time for a waiter to take our order. Furthermore, as mentioned below, this is a restaurant and not a bar/club, and therefore the music is unreasonably loud. When people meet for dinner they assume they will be able to talk to each other.",Skinny Fox
30,Another addition (among many others) at the capital that serves gourmet style food and wine. As a place is not bad... has a character of its own but with poor customer service. Even with reservation they were having trouble getting us a table (rude manners) and taking too long to get the order. Unaware of what is the proper way to serve a glass of wine. Not the best experience.,Skinny Fox
40,"Went out with friends on a weekend night. Very popular, very busy and certainly a buzzy atmosphere. Very nice cocktails. But the good news end here. Food was ok but really nothing special. No identity. Limited and unimaginative wine list. I can't really point out something unique about the place.",Skinny Fox
40,"The newly opened Skinny fox in Nicosia is a nice place to visit as far as decoration is concerned. The food is absolutely excellent and served warm in warm plates. There is though an enormous problem - as often in Nicosia - the music. Too loud, much too loud, therefore one has to almost shout to be heard by the company around the table. What a pity. Of course, we asked for the music to be turned a bit down. Not only were we looked upon as we were coming from another planete but our request was not taken into account. What a pity!",Skinny Fox
40,"Been with couples before christmas, amazing ambiance, parisian vintage, great service, lovely set up, impressive atmosphere, not do impressed yet with the menu choices , but i beleive would show improvements as it's something new in town!! Lovely choices of wines!! Keep it up there!! It's a wonderful place!",Skinny Fox
50,"The dishes were really interesting. Presentation was great, and the decoration was very stylish, too. I had a steak and the meat was of the best quality. There is some room for improvement on service. Will definitely go back.",Skinny Fox
50,"Was really looking forward to this as I had read many reviews about this restaurant and wasn't at all disappointed. The design looks like the interior of a Georgian manor crossed with a french boudoir, dark wood paneled walls and floral 1930's wallpaper with little details here and there that complete its out worldly atmosphere, u literally feel like you have been transported into the past. The service was excellent, the cocktails incredible (I strongly suggest u try the skinny spritzer). My friends and I shared a salad and ordered the shrimp tagliatelle, the pork and corn fed chicken and finished it off with the milfeig and chocolate cake for desert. Give them a Michelin star they deserve it. Two thumbs up!",Skinny Fox
30,Went with four girlfriends for coffee/drinks. Cocktails are quite good and pretty good pricing. Didnt try the food so no comments on that. Service was a bit slow in general.,Skinny Fox
50,Cozy shop with nice atmosphere. Nice welcoming at the entrance. No way to enter without a reservation. Works as bar and coffee shop also. Excellent service from friendly staff ready to serve you. Short menu but with the starters covers a variety of choices. Wine list includes good wines with a range of prices. Everybody was satisfied. Some negatives is that the tables are without tablecloths and there is no cloak room to host your coats. Average price per person 30-50 euros. No private sittings.,Skinny Fox
40,"food - fresh ideas delivered well. For starters, the iranian dolmeh (8euro) and the chinese duck buns (12euro) are great. For mains, the pork (14euro) is very good. The norwegian halibut was on the watery side, as was the pasta. For desserts (each one enough for 2 to share), the chocolate noix is a success, while the millefeuille is rather uneventful.decor / ambiance - quirky cool decor, with attention to detail. Good vide, good music. On the negative, the open plan layout and the lack of clear ""outside"" and ""inside"" means that the inside gets cold on cold nights and that the cigarettes' smoke comes inside.service - very good for Nicosia standards. Both times though, at least a couple of waiters had a body odour issue.drinks - great cocktails, good selection of wines.glitches - elementary, but smoking should not be tolerated. We had to endure two rude eejits smoking their cigars for 40 minutes next to us (inside) before the staff tolld them off. That's simply unacceptable. Also, they dont have black pepper..! Just the pepper melange which doesnt really go with all dishes. Get some black pepper people.",Skinny Fox
40,During my last Business trip to Cyprus I had a really nice surprise from my friends.We went in a new place to have dinner and drinks!When I came in this new restaurant I felt like I was in a film of Pedro Almodovar!!!I have to tell you that I love this director!The decoration is amazing!I will not try to describe the flower wallpaper or the lights or the color of the stools in the bar or the little details that makes this place so unique. You have to go there and to see it!!!!I will talk about the delicious dinner that we had there.First we ordered a really nice salad with pumpkins!!!! So fresh!!!!!!As first dish we ordered (and we shared) Iran Dolmeh and Duck steam buns. Both delicious especially the plate with the Dolmeh!!!!As a main dish I enjoy Tuna (this was actually first dish in the menu). The taste of this “simple” dish was amazing!!!!! I wanted to give my congratulations to chef but unfortunately was too busy. I hope next time.We finished our Dinner with Margaritas!Next time I want to visit this place again!,Skinny Fox
30,"An other addition to the ""beautiful setting- average food"" list of Nicosia's restaurants.Although maximum efford has been made in decorating the place, the same cannot be said for the food (at least for the things i tried) and the service.An other thing that put me off (and Skinny Fox is not the only restaurant doing it) is that despite the very low temperatures, they have an ""open balcony doors"" policy in order to accommodate as many customers as possible.As a result,we had our dinner with our coats on, athough our table was inside and not on the covered terrace. On the otherhand, I have to admit, they do serve amazing coctails!",Skinny Fox
50,"Possibly the coolest most fun, delicious food, excellent service, amazing cocktails, day or night, dinner or dessert, bar or seated, chilling or fun place to be in town at the moment. The town has seen nothing like it before. Go there for dinner with friends or colleagues it is a guaranteed fun night out with excellent flavors and aromas!The service is quick and prompt and the owner regularly walks around the diners to confirm that everything is as expected. Best dish to try is the crab salad and steak for 2! Don't forget to order the chocolate dessert, which you would rather not share....",Skinny Fox
