50,"Very pleasant! Delicious food, good servis! Very nice atmosphere. We always enjoy our lunch there. Hopefully we will be going back soon.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Excellent service, delicious food and very reasonably priced. Lots of options for a vegetarian :-) The mushrooms in garlic sauce were so absolutely delicious, you must order them. Simply perfect. Pleased we ordered two lots of potatoes with the spicy sauce (a nice tomato sauce, not very spicy but very tasty), they were too good to share! Grilled vegetables were ok. Garlic bread yum and hubby had the salmon steak (with potatoes, veges and salad) which he really enjoyed too. We had three pommegranate juices- they were so good, and then two nice desserts to top it all off (banoffi pie & affogato). Total for all that = 32 euro. Lovely location right by the mosque, really nice inside or outside. So pleased we ate here!!",El Sabor Latino
10,"I’ve been here with family over the years many times and it was always a brilliant experience, last two visits specially today was a shock we sat down to order we had to ask for menu then we ordered and our drink came after we finished our meals and even then it was wrong service was absolutely rubbish very rude staff and a big disappointment of a family meal. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone.",El Sabor Latino
20,"Went to El Sabor as it was recommended by my cousin but left very disappointed.I ordered a T bone steak and my cousin ordered a pasta dish. I was asked how would I like my steak ? I replied medium rare.They were bought very quickly and the pasta did look good however my T bone was 1) so thin you’d think it was transparent but worst of all it was so under cooked it was raw, to the point twice I had to change my knife. Now you may say why didn’t you just send it back ? Getting the waiters attention was impossible. I asked one who said give me a moment I’ll send someone over. After about 5/6 minutes I just thought why bother. I’ll eat what I can and leave the rest. We then asked 3 times for the bill. Every time being told someone will come over.In the end I walked over to a waiter & said was this meal free because it was so bad ?He immediately got the Bill & came back too me.First time on a recommendation but last time. If you want a decent meal avoid the Tbone, I can’t comment on rest of the menu as I won’t be going there again.",El Sabor Latino
30,Visited this week as we usually eat here when we visit the Occupied side of Nicosia. Always been good. This visit my husband's chilli chicken was dry and the chilli sauce seemed to be sweet chilli sauce from a bottle. My steak was OK but so thin! The Dianne sauce was delicious though. I didn't feel we'd had a treat as in other visits.....not sure if anything has changed...new owners/chef?,El Sabor Latino
40,"Sabor has a great setting beside Selimiye Camii Mosque with both open air and inside dining. Friendly and efficient staff. Menu offers a good Tapas selection as well as pasta, chicken, steak, fish and salads.Four of us had tapas with a jug of sanghria, beer, bottle of water and desserts all for 360tl about £12 a head, great value.",El Sabor Latino
50,This has been a absolute favourite of ours since it’s open! After 2019 being a year of pure disappointment with the quality of restaurants in girne (where we are staying) my husband remembered here!All I can say is YES!!!! Hats off to the owners who ever they are for maintaining the quality for all these year. To all the tourist who still haven’t discovered this place... your truly missing out extremely fantastic value for money,El Sabor Latino
40,Very well priced restaurant serving good food at very reasonable prices - nice setting in open air - two main courses and two drinks c£14 - couldn’t beat it !,El Sabor Latino
50,"This restaurant in Nicosia (Turkish side) is one of my favourites when working in northern Cyprus, and a great place to meet friends and colleagues. The location is great in the old walled city. Great for lunch and evening meals.The restaurant is extremely popular and can be very busy in the evenings. Staff are really friendly and helpful.The menu is varied and features Spanish and Italian cuisines (as well as local). I particularly love the Patatas Bravas with Italian meatballs for starters. Good lasagne. Homemade lemonade really refreshing at lunchtime.",El Sabor Latino
50,Excellent food and wonderful staff! Would recommend a must visit when travelling to Nicosia. Enjoy !,El Sabor Latino
50,"We have been here before. Lovely friendly staff. The food is consistently good. Lots of choices, well presented and delicious. The prices are very reasonable. Our usual place to eat in Northern Cyprus. Highly recommended.",El Sabor Latino
40,"One of very few decent restaurants in North Nicosia and worth a visit. We went twice but the second time the steak was not as good as the first. A nice evening though all the same. And yes, the Sangria is good.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Generous and tasty dishes in the shadow of the cathedralThe Sabor restaurant terrace is very welcoming, in the shadow of the cathedral, a bit off the main tourist lanes of North Lefkosia. Ordered dishes were generous and very tasty: a feta salad, al dente arrabiata pasta or garlic shrimp and calamaris, without to mention the sabor fish. The ""local"" Turkish beers were served at the right temperature by a friendly and efficient staff. The ratio price/quality is excellent making it probably the best alternative to other tourist feeding places, on both sides of the green line. It remained the absolute best reference during our stay. We visited it twice. Apparently, the locals also like this place.",El Sabor Latino
40,I was skeptical to visit a Spanish & Italian restaurant at first. The wide menu also made me curious. We were a group of 10 and everyone tried different types of dishes. I had the shrimp and calamari with salad and potatoes. The presentation was quite interesting as well. My dish was tasty and I was satisfied. Their sangria is to die for!,El Sabor Latino
50,Best food and custumer service in Cyprus. Manager Riza is the best. This place feels like home. 10/10,El Sabor Latino
50,This is a restaurant continuing the similar menu for more than 10 years and it brings quality. The restaurant is next to Selimiye Mosque and there is no trafic so you can sit outside in the center of old city and enjoy your quality meal and pay around 30 euro for 2 people. What else do you want?,El Sabor Latino
50,"Surprised that the menu was almost exclusively Italian dishes in the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia. Close to a lot of attractions. Best of all the super helpful and attentive staff as well as the excellent quality of food, not to mention the huge portion sizes.",El Sabor Latino
40,"I had the mushroom cream chicken with a cappuccino and hit chocolate. Mine was delicious and perfectly cooked. My partner had pasta with Gorgonzola and he was not as satisfied, calling it average. Huge portion again. Located in a lovely area close to the mosque on the Turkish side of Nicosia. Service was excellent and attentive.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Being at the Turkish side and close to the visiting monument area we checked this restaurant and it was great. Fantastic service, food and ambiance. The price was really worthed since the conversion of the Turkish lira made it really good value.",El Sabor Latino
50,"There are not an overwhelming choice of restaurants in the northern part of Nicosia bit sabor would be just at home on the other side of the Green Line. Very good food in healthy portions, well priced house wine, excellent service and atmosphere. The restaurant is in the shadows of St. Sophia with plentiful outdoor seating and a cool vibe inside. The dishes are mainly influenced by Italian, Spanish and Portuguese cuisine. A great place to relax and enjoy the wine and company.",El Sabor Latino
50,El Sabor is great for a Tapas snack of a full on meal. Menu has enough choices to please everyone. Been back several times.,El Sabor Latino
40,The food is cheap and it’s one of the most cozy places that we’ve eaten in Nicosia. Would recommend if you are on the Turkish side of Nicosia.,El Sabor Latino
40,"Very efficient and friendly staff, very well organised, incredibly good food for the price and an over all lovely evening. Nice and relaxing outdoor space, perfect for a romantic meal. Great wine and great steaks!",El Sabor Latino
50,"Great food, friendly staff and nice location. Credit cards accepted here. Given the current £-TL exchange rate, makes a cheap meal!",El Sabor Latino
40,"A huge place with lots of outdoor space. The food is decent to very good, the service is excellent, the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. What's not to like?",El Sabor Latino
40,"This seems to be the only modernish restaurant in the old city deviating from the standard tourist and local fare. Large terrace outdoors, the kitchen is Mediterrenean with a Portuguese touch.Still, the food is simple and the entrecote is cut as if it were a schnitzel. Would recommend, but only due to the absence of better restaurants.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Always excellent food and good service. A place where you will go again and again, Visit this place already for more than 30 years.",El Sabor Latino
50,"A very good Spanish-Italian fusion restaurant located in the center of the old town of Nicosia. Out of all the Italian restaurants I have been both in the South and the North of Cyprus, I have to say Sabor is the clear winner when it comes to food. The only issue with the restaurant is the slloooowwwww service, the waiters (there are very few of them for the size and number of tables so rightfully they look and act stressed, tired, and annoyed).",El Sabor Latino
20,It was not a busy lunchtime but the staff took over 20 minutes to come to my table to acknowledge me and even then I had to ask for the menu . They really had little interest in serving . I decided just to have s drink and not even risk ordering anything due to their poor attitude and lack of service.,El Sabor Latino
50,"Passed this place many times on our visits to Nicosia but decided to give it a go today. We were not disappointed! The staff were lovely and we enjoyed chatting to them. The menu was extensive covering classic Spanish and Italian food. The four of us had a drink each, a main course and a dessert and small bread rolls and oil was supplied with the drinks.. The food arrived very quickly was hot and above all, delicious! Clean plates all round and the bill came to 240 lira ( €50 ). The place is located in a quiet square to the rear of the main mosque. Loved it!",El Sabor Latino
40,"Stumbled upon this restaurant whilst walking the streets of the old town Nicosia. Food was really good, prices were good and service was ok.",El Sabor Latino
40,This place was full of locals at lunchtime which is always a good sign. We sat outside- but the inside was a very trendy bar. The food was good and reasonably priced. It has free wifi and is overlooking a lovely mosque.,El Sabor Latino
30,This place is in a great location on a quiet square next to a church.The food us Italian /Spanish which is a little odd on Turkish Cyprus but it was full of locals so must be popular.We had the tapas and it was good and tasty. The only complaint I have is that the service was quite slow.,El Sabor Latino
40,"The location is perfect: no road, a lovely square and the beautiful mosque / cathedral right in front. The terrasse is well arranged, the menu is varied, and there are good options for vegetarians. Good for couples or with friends.",El Sabor Latino
50,"What a find this is. The only restaurant in old north Nicosia to serve truly European cuisine. And to illustrate just how good this is, the place was packed out the night we went, with tables turning over 3 and 4 times in the 2 hours we were there. The menu is Spanish and Italian, mainly tapas and pasta, although there are mains meat and fish dishes. We ordered tapas straight away and were amazed when our food was delivered after only a couple of minutes. But don’t be alarmed, the taste was amazing. We had prawns in oil and garlic, fried calamari, mussels in a delicious creamy tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, olives and two baskets of bread, plus a bottle of Pinot Grigio, all for the equivalent of €22. Can you believe that? Fantastic food and fantastic value. We couldn’t believe it! Everywhere else we found in old North Nicosia was kebabs, kebabs and kebabs. No wonder it was so busy with mainly young locals.",El Sabor Latino
30,The restaurant is located at the old town of Kyneria. Outdoor option of the cafe type restaurant is increasing the satisfaction. The menu is serving for all needs that you would expect from a cafe. I suggest for family visit purposes mainly.,El Sabor Latino
50,"I haven't been to Sabor for a while, and by chance I have been twice this month. Both times were wonderful. Fabulous service. Excellent food. Lovely ambience. Very good wine list. I can't recommend it enough.",El Sabor Latino
40,Located in Nicosia. Tasty and nice food. Calm place and the service correct. The chicken avocado was tasty too. Price / quality very reasonable.,El Sabor Latino
40,"This restaurant is located on the Turkish side of the Nicosia, make sure you have you passport with you to cross the checkpoints. Very affordable restaurant with a nice variety of food. I have chicken avocado. A tender piece of chicken with fresh avocado and side salad, very fresh and crunchy vegetables, in addition to pumpkin soup, thick but not very well seasoned. Come to this place it is nice.",El Sabor Latino
50,"This has got to be my all time favourite restaurant in Lefkosa (Nicosia) Northern Cyprus. There is so much choice on the menu and it’s all cooked fresh, the waiters are friendly and efficient, when we visit Northern Cyprus we make this restaurant a must, because it’s so nice, I did suggest to the owner that they should open one in Bluewater Kent, so that we didn’t have to wait until we where on holiday. We have taken several friends and family members too Sabor and they have loved the menu, and the experience of a different restaurant serving a completely different variety of food, if you get the chance have visit, I don’t think you will be unhappy",El Sabor Latino
50,We had lunch here today. Our third visit here. Such a great place. Amazing value and large portions. Everything is cooked perfectly. The Turkish wine is super. Reasonably priced too. We sat outside under the pergola. The staff were friendly and efficient. A super place to have lunch after crossing over onto the northern side. I know we’ll return time and time again.,El Sabor Latino
40,This is one of my restaurants in downtown Nicosia (north) that I know will never let me down. The food is very good and the ambiance at night is amazing. Make sure to try their Sangria.,El Sabor Latino
50,"This is our second visit to El Sabor and it really hasn't changed. Great selection of food, we went for the Tapas this time. The staff and really helpful and friendly. Would really recommend this pace if you are in the area.",El Sabor Latino
30,Mmmmmmm....too much food on the plate. Too much going on in the dish..with flavours and different elements vying to please your senses. They think they offer a take on modern European cuisine..they don't. I won't rush back.,El Sabor Latino
50,A very good restaurant with outside seatings at the North part of Nicosia (Turkish part) serving Spanish tapas and Mediterranean dishes. Fast service good taste cheap prices.,El Sabor Latino
50,Everything I had there was delicious. Especially the pastas were my favorite. You can try their sangria with pleasure. There are several bars nearby. The staff was very helpful. You can try the evening snacks with a beer after sightseeing.,El Sabor Latino
30,"This restaurant is in a lovely setting by the Selimiye mosque, and has a wide selection of Mediterranean-influenced food and drink - a nice touch was the vino tinto con limon. Pastas were good, especially the penne pasta with sirloin, Gorgonzola and sundries tomatoes.",El Sabor Latino
20,"Since the location is very central in the middle of the old town and surrounded by the historical monuments, this restaurant is popular. But I would never recommend it. First of all, if you dont make yourself visible by standing up and walking angrily towards the waiters, they dont see you. You give your order and then the waiting process begins. AND in the end you get your food. Just ordinary. Not worth waiting at all. Not worth all that fuss. There are much better restaurants around. Pls ask local people for recommendation apart from Sabor. I am a local. You can ask me as well by sending private message.",El Sabor Latino
40,We visited the occupied part of Nicosia and had lunch at this restaurant. We were seated outside as the music inside was a little loud. They were playing some really nice older music but we wanted to just hear it in the background.The entree of chicken wings were absolutely delicious. Juicy with just a little spice! The prawn and calamari came on a hanging skewer and looked very impressive. The portion was a little small - accompanied by lovely vegetables and potatoes. It was very tasty.The chicken gorgonzola that my friend had was tasty and a sizable portion also with vegetables and potatoes. We did not have desert - only coffee.I will surely return to this restaurant!,El Sabor Latino
50,"Great location. Stopped here for drinks and sat admiring Selimiye Mosque that was facing it. Staff very helpful and friendly, frappe and fresh juices were lovely.",El Sabor Latino
50,As I live in Cyprus it is my pleasure to go to this really excellent restaurant quite regularly.. it would be difficult to find a better location set as it is just behind the main mosque in lefkosa.. one can eat outside most of the year but in the winter the inside although quite large is very cosy .. excellent service always and the menu is extensive.. wine list also great.... menu wise I have several times been told what I wanted was not available as when chef went shopping the particular product was not up to scratch and he wasn't going to use a below par thing in his cooking.. portions generous and well presented. .I'm not overly fond of the large wine glasses which makes the wine in the bottom look a bit miserable but that's personal.....everything is very clean and it is easy to spend a long time enjoying the meal and the company,El Sabor Latino
50,"It is one of my all time favourites , literally never disappointed me. I visited many times, food, service and ambiance are always up to my expectations. Even when I am not hungry I can just go their to enjoy the sangria. He prices are quite reasonable . If you felt like having a dessert, don't miss out on their apple pie.",El Sabor Latino
30,"Sabor used to be one of the best places to eat in northern Nicosia. I was a regular there. The location is just lovely, both in the winter and in the summer. It is authentic and spacious. It is really nice to sit outside too, and mostly, they play good music. The service is good and the staff is helpful. They have a good wine selection too. But the food that was really good before has at best became inconsistent. Sometimes they lack the ingredients, sometimes it is totally reheated, sometimes it is hotter or milder or saltier than before... Sometimes it says 8 chicken wings and you get 7 instead, sometimes the portions are a good size and other times too small. You get the idea... it has become inconsistent and because of that, mediocre. it is supposedly a Latino restaurant and a wine bar, but their cheese plate is just disappointing. Parmesan and feta cheese, really? no nuts, no dried fruit, no mature cheddar, no brie, really? Last time, they didnt event have peanuts, or mixed nuts or popcorn or any other nibbly bits to go with our wine let alone an acceptable cheese plate. I still go there, mainly for the location.",El Sabor Latino
40,This is one of my favourite restaurants on the island. The food is tasty and location is charming especially when the bougainvilleas bloom! Such a treat for your eyes and stomach in the old city Nicosia! p.s. don't forget to try the sangria!,El Sabor Latino
50,"El sabor Latino has been a great place to eat for islanders since the day it's opened it's doors which was 2004 as far as I remember. Located in the old city centre of Nicosia, it offers a beautiful view from the courtyard. The food is good. It's also nice to enjoy an average priced drinks with friends. Pastas are nice. I highly recommend if you find yourself in Nicosia.",El Sabor Latino
40,The place is known as the first spot to sell sangria in the north. The sangria isn't the best but it's not bad either,El Sabor Latino
30,We enjoyed lunch here. We appreciated the shaded tables on a hot day. We enjoyed a tapas menu - the chicken goujons stuffed with cheese were tasty and the potatoes nicely spiced.Prices were reasonable and the service slick. We were fascinated by the number of cats too!,El Sabor Latino
40,"It's a restaurant that have there for ages. Standard is good quality food, prices are reasonable. Spot is in the middle of traditional historic buildings so ambiance is quite lovely. Suggested restaurant for a night out meal.",El Sabor Latino
40,"Nice ambience, good food, cheap prices compared to Greek side as you can pay in Turkish Lira. Sirloin steak 32 lira (8 quid)",El Sabor Latino
50,"This has long been our favourite restaurant in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Food is tasty and fresh and in generous portions. I particularly enjoy the seafood dishes, although the menu is varied and off menu variations are well accepted. Drinks are reasonably priced and the service is usually good and always friendly.The venue is very popular with locals, both at lunchtime and in the evenings.It is located in the newly and beautifully renovated historic centre of the city. On our last visit we were also able to watch and experience a display of Whirling Dervishes in a nearby historic building.",El Sabor Latino
10,The service was awful was waiting nearly an hour for the food wouldn't eat here again wouldn't recommend it to anyone,El Sabor Latino
40,When you visit nicosia. I really recommend El Sabor Latino. Specially during summer nights sitting outside and eating nice for will make you totally happy.,El Sabor Latino
40,"We called in here for lunch. We hadn't boomed. The interior had air conditioning and the feel of the building was quite industrialised. Concrete walls, exposed ducts and metal girders.We ordered our meals, but the service as unbelievably slow despite the restaurant being almost empty. Eventually three beers arrived for four of us! One member of the party went and collected the beer herself from the bar. The wait for the food and then the bill was painfully slow.The food itself was good. I had the calamari and prawn skewer. It was spectacular suspended on a stand.The price was reasonable for the food and drink too.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Tired of the typical Nicosia food, we traveled across to the northern side one night and a passerby recommended this restaurant. It's behind the mosque looking out at a small town square. The location is fantastic - especially when you eat outside. I had a pasta dish that was some of the best pasta I've ever had but the real surprise was the skewered seafood with a fantastic presentation. Definitely recommend!",El Sabor Latino
30,I have been to this restaurant many times but not for a few months. Today this normally busy little gem was very quiet which is unusual especially at this time of year. The service was OK by NC standards. My sister had a beef salad that was all lettuce and very little else - not something she would have again. I had grilled vegetables and a tapas portion of shrimps which lacked any flavour at all and were rather boring. This restaurant normally serves some super food so I was disappointed. The location is still lovely and they offer indoor and outside seating - and Spotlessly clean toilets.,El Sabor Latino
50,"Arrived just after noon, 3/4 tables taken but soon got busy. Charming waiter suggested a few tapas dishes so off we went.Garlic mushrooms, calamari, and chicken wings and a portion of patatas bravas!Food came quickly, service was attentive and price was excellent value.Amusing highlight of the 60 minute experience was the local business people running to move their cars as the cops blew their warning whistles !",El Sabor Latino
40,The menu had lots of choice at good prices. Our meals were lovely and the portion sizes very good. The service was friendly and the atmosphere and location great. Definitely one to return to and encourage friends to try. A lovely part of Nicosia with lots to see and do.,El Sabor Latino
40,"Nice location, authentic exterior, modern interior, friendly english speaking staff, nice food, not expensive",El Sabor Latino
40,"It was a business dinner. Yet, the waiter, realizing that it is our first time in Sabor and therefore we are not familiar with the dishes in the restaurants, he did his best to understand our preferences and not only recommended dishes for us individually, but almost let the cook prepare custom fit food. We all enjoyed our food. Having a bad experience in one of the the top rated Italian restaurant in London just a few days ago, I was very happy having a very delicious Italian food. A cosy environment is a plus.",El Sabor Latino
50,After thinking about where to go to for our anniversary I suggested el sabor because I always enjoy it.I ordered off menu as there are less vegetarian pasta dishes on the new menu. They are quite happy to accommodate. We treated ourselves to prosecco. It was perfect served with ice cold glasses. Service fantastic as usual. Go you won't be disappointed.,El Sabor Latino
50,"it has very tasty foods and good environment, there are many historical places around that restaurant.",El Sabor Latino
40,"A Cypriot friend recommended this restaurant to us and took us here. What a treat it was, extensive menu, something for everyone's taste, large portions (couldn't finish my smoked salmon pasta) and lovely atmosphere with the Selimiye Mosque (St. Sofya) nearby and beautifully illuminated at night. Would definitely go again and recommend this restaurant to others.",El Sabor Latino
10,"A few years back we used to visit this restaurant quite often. We always enjoyed the food and the service! Nostalgia led us back to Sabor and we were bitterly disappointed. Upon arriving there we were put off by the state of the tables. It looked cheap and uncared for. The service though okay, was exaggerated and we ended up waiting 45 minutes for our meals! The salads and maib courses were brought at the same time and they were really nothing special!! As we ate we were attacked by flies and wasps and there was no apology whatsoever for the late arrival of the foo! Not planning on returning",El Sabor Latino
40,"We had a dinner on a busy Monday evening. It's very nicely located at the big yard of Santa Sophia Cathedral / Selimiye Mosque and it seems quite a favourite as it was full (considered a week day). Menu is extensive and surely you will find something you like. I didn't find it purely Latin/Spanish. There are various dishes ranging from Italian to Spanish to more International cuisine. That's why maybe the 'Latino' in the name sounds limiting. We had mainly dishes with chicken and you have lots of choice on them (i.e. mango, curry etc). Recommended!",El Sabor Latino
50,"A beautiful summer evening spent with friends al fresco enjoying excellent food. The surrounding environment reminded me of Nicosia of yesteryear but the service and food was certainly up to date and without fault. We tried a variety of starters, tomato and mozarella salad, mushrooms in a garlic sauce, marinated octopus and a few others which set the standard for our main courses. Highly recommended is the garlic and cream prawns with potatoes and vegetables, large portions but every single mouthful was eaten. Desserts are homemade - the bananoffee pie is to die for! Time just passed without us realising it had gone midnight! Definitely on our 'to go agan list'.",El Sabor Latino
50,"i love this place, I found it by accident when a London Taxi driver who I'd met invited me for a meal. The food, ambience and service is superb .... I always come back here to sit beneath the walls of the Lusignan cathedral (now a mosque) and while away the hours. I now know the chef and his family and I would recommend to only my best friends.",El Sabor Latino
50,"We got here due to a local recommendation who we didnt know about his personal taste. It was a refreshing surprise! The food is delicious, the plate sizes are super big. We even had to take with home what we couldn't eat.",El Sabor Latino
10,Went late afternoon and the restaurant was nearly empty. Ordered a bottle of white and red wine. Waiter brought 4 frozen glasses and poured the red into two of them. When We tried to stop her she said no it always in cold glasses and continued to pour second glass even thought We had insisted that we did not want this. I asked for fresh glasses but they never arrived. Very rude lady waiter with a terrible attitude. Starters were good but the attitude of the staff was appalling. They tried to clear our starters before we had finished as they told us our mains were ready. Waiter not happy when one off our party said for him to wait until we had all finished. He stood looking at us and As soon as we had finished our last mouthful the mains were thrown in front of us and we're dried up and cold but we gave up trying to get a good service and asked for the bill and left. It's a shame as we have been to sabor on many occasions and had a great experience. This time we had taken two friends who were here on holiday and had raved about the food and service. Very very disappointed. Perhaps the notice in the window said it all EXPERIENCED STAFF REQUIRED. They will not need any new staff if they keep treating customers like this.,El Sabor Latino
50,"We went there twice. First time, we were there with a group, and had Bistecca Salad. It was great. The second time we were there for coffee and Cheese Cake. Both were great, Cheese cake was a bit over baked. Other than that the service was a bit slow and the waiters did not pay much attention, esp. during the second visit. My impression is that they take better care of groups and known customers than tourists.",El Sabor Latino
50,"A quick trip to El Sabor. I like El Sabor as one of the few restaurants that have vegetarian food on the menu.Everyone was happy with their meal, tasty, made from scratch, home made sauces.Great service as always, the staff here know just how to approach customers, help with choices, and are always polite and pleasant, with a good knowledge of English too.Much cheaper than some of the tasteless plastic joints the youngsters go to, and a much higher standard of fare.",El Sabor Latino
50,"I've been there today for lunch (it is my second time) and I am exited then before. First time I went there on recommendation of my friend, since I visit northern side often. Staff was very welcoming and kind. They helped me with order, since they have plenty of choices and everything looks delicious. First time I had grilled chicken with herbs and it was amazing(juicy, tender and really tasteful) served with fresh cooked vegetable (soft and nice cooked) and some potato.This time I had mussels for starter(tapas-just to taste it) and it was wonderful. I couldn't resist their fresh dark bread with olives and deep in olive oil (yummy-and I hate olives :)) for main I had diet sirloin since I am on diet(kind off) :) I was served by manager who was very polite and in the end suggested me an AMAZING dessert with banana and caramel...mmmmmmmmm.....Definitely I will go back as soon as I can, because I enjoy service,ambient,music and off course food. HIGLY recommended to everybody, since anybody can find something for themselves",El Sabor Latino
40,food excellent but access into the restaurant is awful ! It really needs a ramp several customers were commenting the same as my husband struggled to get my wheelchair up the steep step! Come on Sabor get to treat disabled as people too?,El Sabor Latino
50,For the modest price this is a very good restaurant. Nice setting in old town in atmospheric renovated quarter - probably the nicest part of Turkish Nicosia.,El Sabor Latino
50,We visited El Sabor twice recently and have enjoyed the menu very much. This restaurant is very clean and the staff very welcoming. Good value for money. It is a must when visiting the Turkish occupied part of Nicosia.,El Sabor Latino
50,We stopped at this restaurant off a main square in Nicosia recently and really enjoyed the food. We also enjoyed the Sangria as well!!! This place had a pretty extensive menu which included everything from Pizza and Pasta to Steaks and Asian style noodles. All three of us enjoyed our food and would definitely return to this restaurant if given the chance.,El Sabor Latino
50,"What a pleasant surprise! my hotel in Kyrenia catered for ""UK taste"" and I so wanted a decent meal before I left for home. I had a wonderful steak Sabor - freshly cooked, good use of herbs, good portion size, tasty. What more could you want?",El Sabor Latino
40,visited this with in-laws who are regular visitors. The service was attentive and when it arrived it was delicious. Well presented. Good value for money.,El Sabor Latino
40,"This is obviously a popular restaurant in the Turkish part of Nicosia, although a bit tucked away. It faces onto a square with a lot of outside seating. We took advantage of this as the weather was mild. What we didn't realise is that we would be plagued by the local cats, who all looked quite well fed. It seems obvious that some customers have been feeding them which isn't very sensible and spoils things for other customers who want to eat outside. I counted six different cats and they were a real nuisance, nor is their presence around the tables (& no doubt on them if they can get away with it) particularly hygienic. That apart the food was very good and they accept payment in euros as well as Turkish lira. The exchange rate is also very good so it was cheaper than eating in an equivalent Greek Cypriot establishment. Service was good but a few smiles would have been welcome - they seemed to be reserved for the regulars. I would go again but sit indoors!",El Sabor Latino
50,"such good value, for large portions.had difficulties getting in as I am in a wheelchair no ramps, it would not take much to improve the access to this place. Everyone was pleasantly surprised with the food. I was not so keen on my Thai salmon too many bones?The sticky toffee pudding was awesome.Can definitely recommend.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Going to the Turkish aide is a great idea for dinner. Sabor's was easy to find right by the Mosque. The menu is Turkish, Italian, Portugese, Japanese and Spanish. Very resonably priced and the food was excellent. Going to the Turkish side is not like going to North Korea. It's a great restaurant when in Nicosia. Highly recommended.",El Sabor Latino
40,"Stopped off here for a snack whilst visiting Nicosia. We shared some Tapas which was really tasty, the water then suggested that the chef made wonderful deserts... and he was correct. The Tiramisu was lovely. It's obviously a restaurant where the locals go and this was reflected in the price. Very reasonable and they also took Euros (wish they'd said that on the menu).",El Sabor Latino
50,Very clean and nicely laid out.nice view of the nearby church.good quality Mediterranean food. I had mango chicken with tagiatelli in creamy sauce and my wife had chicken and mushroom pizza.both delicious.I had a beer and the wife had a large glass of wine.price came to £16.50 sterling so great value.would definitely visit again,El Sabor Latino
50,"It's one of the best restaurants of both parts of Cyprus. You have the great possibility to taste both italian and local cuisine. The staff is very helpful and nice, the cook is just a genius. I highly recommend to visit the restaurant in the silent part of Turkish Nicosia",El Sabor Latino
40,"A really nice spot serving simple Italian/Spanish style food, it was a most enjoyable lunch in the sun in wonderful surroundings. Good attentive but not overbearing service, homemade bread and olive oil/balsamic complimentary, good drinks menu at sensible prices and a very comprehensive but not massive food menu. Worth a visit in this exquisite location. Lunchtimes can get very busy with the ""business"" crowd so early or late would be a good tip, we were in just before it filled up.",El Sabor Latino
10,"I stopped off here for lunch during a visit to the Turkish Cypriot part of Nicosia or Lefkosa. The restaurant, which served Italian and Spanish food, seemed very welcoming with lots of chairs and tables with umbrellas as well as plenty of indoor space.It took a while to get a menu and then a much longer wait to have my order taken. At this point I discovered that Sunday is the pizza chefs day off so the pizza I had chosen was not available. Then my substitute dish was not available. I made another selection and ordered my drink and 5 minutes later was told the drink was not available either so I chose another.I waited ages for the food and the whole focus of the waiter’s attention became the children and wife of the owner who took priority over everyone else while they were served.When the food came it was dry and unmemorable.",El Sabor Latino
40,"We had tapas in this restaurant while visiting Nicosia, the food is lovely and the service is good, try the home made lemonade",El Sabor Latino
40,"Tucked away near to the church but still in the centre of Northern Nicosia this restaurant is peaceful, clean and the staff were lovely. We had a tasty lunch (oddly serving Portuguese wine and dishes which we love). Unfortunately a swarm of hornets circled round us outside just before a cyclist ran over a tiny kitten. We were moved to another table and the staff brought some water and were very concerned. They didn't charge for one meal which wasn't eaten due to concern for the kitten even though it wasn't their fault. Would definitely recommend for a lunch of evening meal.",El Sabor Latino
40,A highly recommended restaurant. Nice open air arrangement. Full of customers yet very peaceful as not many shops around. The food is excellent and tasty. The menu is good and had quite variety of food. Though been there only once yet like the place very much. For sure you would love the place.,El Sabor Latino
50,"I had the misfortune of everything I fancied ""not being on"" that evening.My guest asked for a steak to be cooked well done and be served with a hot spicy sauce and salad, which was not on the menu, but they did a great job of!I was offered noodles without meat, which again is not on the menu, but was very tasty with real japanese wholewheat noodles.",El Sabor Latino
40,"I have been here a couple of times now and both occasions were at lunchtime. There is loads of indoor and outdoor seating. The menu is quite extensive, pizzas are delicious. I had a superb tuna salad on my last visit. The waiting staff are friendly and efficient. Definitely worth a visit because it's in a fab location where you can relax and chill out. They have free wi fi.",El Sabor Latino
40,Just popped in for a quick coffee and to check e-mails but what a nice place! Good coffee. Friendly service. Great location and clean modern decor.,El Sabor Latino
40,In a city or country where you can get really fed up trying to find suitable things to eat at least here there are about 8 or more tappas that are vegetarian some vegan . Sangria is good.,El Sabor Latino
10,"I think this is my second review for this restaurant. The first one was better but no improvements since then. What's more, it got worse. We went there with friends the other day. we ordered 8 dishes and unfortunately only one was happy. On my plate, I found a few tiny pieces of pasta or noodles which definitely didn't belong to that dish. In addition to that I found a small piece of mushroom which again shouldn't be there. When I noticed those ı stopped eating of course and told the waiter about it. He just nodded his head and went on. Almost noone ate their dish completely and we were mostly hungry when we left. And our complaints didn't receive any attention or any response either. So, my suggestion ""Don't go there if you don't want to experience a dinner ruining surprise, let alone the not so very nice state of their ""WC (Gents)"" which I mentioned in my earlier review. Sorry to see such a place that could be a fantastic restaurant turning into a bad restaurant everytime I go there. Most unfortunate.",El Sabor Latino
50,"When visiting the Turkish side of Nicosia, we always have lunch at this restaurant. The staff are really nice, fun & helpful. The location is wonderful, a really beautiful spot beside the church, quiet & relaxing. The food is excellent & although the tapas portions are small, it's just the right amount - in the heat, you don't fancy huge plates of food. I had sangria this time, this was lovely. It's very reasonably priced for a great meal. Highly recommend.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Sabor to me is the best restaurant in Northern Cyprus , their menu has over 100 dishes all explained in English and Turkish, and the food is cooked to perfection and taste wonderful, you can sit outside and eat or inside where there is excellent air conditioning, free WI-FI if you are one of those people that are constantly on their phone/laptop/IPad etc. At no extra charge when sitting down you are given some rolls/bread and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip in while you wait for your order to be prepared. The staff are friendly and quick with the service, if you do visit Lefkosa then I would recommend you take a visit to Sabor",El Sabor Latino
50,A great restaurant which has never failed to please me and my friends. The food is always reasonably priced and the quality is always good.,El Sabor Latino
50,"Food taste and quality are great, accompanying wine is good, rates are inexpensive, service and staff are fine and the location of the restaurant is unique : at the heart of old Nicosia, looking towards Selimiye Mosque, the great historical building. It's a pleasure to spend time at Sabor Nicosia...",El Sabor Latino
40,"This good decorated restaurant, when I came with my friends loved the food. The meal was international and good served. We tried all portions from ourselves and it was really nice.",El Sabor Latino
40,"Sabor has been around for a long time and the location is just magic: in the old square with the Mosque in front of you. The food is nice, just what you will expect from a Spanish/Italian place with pasta and tapas etc. every thing is well cooked. On a lovely Sunday spring day sitting in the shade of the trees, listening to jazz music, listening to the call from the mosque, sipping chilled white wine and nibbling different plates... That was just we wanted and enjoyed.",El Sabor Latino
30,"The only word on the outside of this restaurant (located near the old cathedral/mosque on the north side of the border) is ""sabor"". I did not know it claimed to also have ""el"" and ""latino"" in the name. Never mind. I lived in Spain for over 10 years and speak the language fluently and although we have enjoyed eating lunch at this restaurant a number of times, only the name reminded me of Spain (Sabor = flavour).If the weather is good then the setting of this restaurant is ideal for eating outside. The menu is pretty extensive and they are more than generous with the quantities of pasta (Spanish ??) but not so generous with what they say goes with it, such as chicken. So, while the prices seem reasonable for some dishes they are not cheap.On this last occasion we were there with friends from the UK and the service was both slow and lacking in ""customer care"".We will be back, but a bit more cautiously regarding their so-called quality.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Studying in the Greek part of Cyprus, I like to come here regularly. The staff are friendly and the setting is great. The open kitchen gives a great feel to the place and you can watch your meal being cooked in front of your eyes. The food has never failed me once. Just be prepared to get a shock when the mosque next door does its very loud call to prayer which can be a little disruptive for the few minutes that it lasts.The food is also extremely cheap compared to southern Cyprus. If possible, pay in Turkish Liras to get the best price as if you ask to pay with Euros they will round up the price a little to a cleaner figure.",El Sabor Latino
50,"Located on a cobbled square in a pedestrianised area, near the Selimiye Mosque and the Eaved HousePros:-Free WiFi - no password required-Friendly staff-Plentiful indoor and outdoor seating, including a leather sofa lounge area-Attractive decor on the walls-Menu in English-Wide range of food consisting of starters, pastas, chicken, meats, noodles, salads, paella, fish, desserts. Children's menu choices.-Wide range of drinks including white wines, red wines, beer, cocktails, cold drinks, coffee.-I ate chicken pesto (19TL), apple pie and drank a Efes Pilsen (50cl draught, 6TL) and a latte, which I thought were all reasonably priced.-Blankets available outside if you are cold-Relaxing background musicCons:-No ramp access",El Sabor Latino
50,"We've been to Sabors many times-- with friends, family, small children and as a couple--always excellent! The ambiance is lovely--I especially love the music. A wide variety of choices on the menu and so you will find something to your liking. The waiters are helpful and attentive even when the restaurant is full---not to be missed!.........and the good news is there's now one in Famagusta!!!",El Sabor Latino
50,"One of the best places that you can have a nice dinner out in Northen Cyprus. It is located in the old city in Nicosia. The aura of the place is worthy to experience. There used to be a Spanish guitarist whose name is Emo, make you feel the Mediterranean. The dishes were delicious. The patrons of the restaurant are chaste. Enjoy your time there.",El Sabor Latino
30,"I have been to El Sabor several times, sometimes with big groups up to 20 people. The service has always been very good and I have never had to wait around. The food is nothing surprising at such as it is a combination of pastas, tapas and other Spanish style grub. I have never been disappointed with my meal, yet I could really not describe the food as ""amazing."" Several friends have commented however that their paella is really very good.The settings are also very nice so the place is a safe bet if you fancy something non-East Mediterranean at the North side of Nicosia: the walk from the check point is nice on its own.",El Sabor Latino
40,"I come to this restaurant based in Lefkosa everytime i visit Kibris. The spanish style tapas are tsy the pasta is good and te chops are to die for. What impressed me is that they respect the local mosque next door to them, when the call for prayer started they turned off the music in respect. It definately earned my espect for them.",El Sabor Latino
50,"We have visited Sabors in every season--eaten indoors and outside. Food & service always excellent! Yes, outside there are loads of cats but that's hardly the restaurant's fault.Every dish I've tried has not disappointed--we regard the restaurant as one of the very best we've eaten in in Cyprus. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and we would recommend it to one and all!! The music played is reallylovely--chilled, relaxing and very cool!A real treat not to be missed!",El Sabor Latino
50,"It's best to visit this restaurant in the evening for its magical setting, just by the 13th century cathedral which is lit at night The food is wonderful, with very generous servings. The starters are especially delicious. There is a little restaurant next door, owned by the same family which does great mezes.",El Sabor Latino
30,"The food is really tasty and delicious...Of course, you might want to go a few times try different dishes and then decide on your favourite because some flavours might be a bit strong. However, that is no way to say the food is bad. Great food indeed. The service is nice, too. Waiters mostly kind and fast (except for times when it is too crowded...management could hire a few more waiters actually). I like to visit the place especially in winters and sit indoors because there can be hundreds of cats around that won't let you eat in peace (they jump on the table and try and have a bite of your dish etc etc) in summer. Besides, the tables are set right on the street not a garden or a seperated area. Well, you might enjoy that too.The orst thing about this restaurant, I guess, is the WC. There is just one for ladies and one for men. When the place is crowded you need to wait at the door of the WC or go back and try your luck again. Another awful thing about the toilet is that it looks dirty. I don't think it is very dirty but it looks like that. Yet another point is that they don't have paper towels or anything of that sort to dry your hands after you wash them. They really NEED to DO something about the WC.One last thing...just when I logged in to write my review I noticed that Sabor's address is given to be in the ""Turkish occupied territory""...well, to be honest it really doesn't look like it is under any ""occupied"" state at all. It is one of the fanciest restaurants at a very nice and touristic area of the city where lots of tourists visit everyday. So that definition might be somehow over exaggerated and unfair because people there don't seem to be under any ""occupation"" and from what I've seen (I've been living in TRNC for about 6 years now) and it seems like there's a lot of democracy and state government here. Management might want to change that detail too. Other than these two points, it is a nice restaurant that you should visit when you are in Nicosa, TRNC. (we do quite frequently)PS: They sometimes serve a special desert made with figs...tastes great...not to be missed if you're lucky enough to be there on a day that they serve it...no harm asking the waiters...",El Sabor Latino
40,"We were only in Northern Cyprus for a week, but went twice to this beautifully-sited restaurant. The owner, Fatma, was very welcoming and the food and wines were very good. Well worth a visit - and decent value for money",El Sabor Latino
40,I have been many times and will continue to go. The decor and the food are great. An open kitchen watching the chefs prepare the food is excellent. The waiters can sometimes be a bit unattentive but I can live with that. The pasta dishes are excellent. All washed down with an ice cold Efes in a frozen glass. If you are in the are then give it a try. Go to the top of the main shopping street and go to the left of the huge mosque. It is in the bottom left of the square.,El Sabor Latino
40,"Lets start with the bad: te service is not as good as it should be. Waiters seem to work rather randomly and, as a result, your experience will vary wildly from good to horrible service.The good: beautiful setting on the Arabahmet square on the Turkish side of Nicosia. The Selimiye Mosque (Church converted to a Mosque) looks beautiful.Even better: the food. El Sabor's paella is the best. Not the best in Cyprus but one of the best I have ever eaten. And I had paella in Spain, Cuba, Europe, etc... This one is the tastiest! Go there in May->Nov, sit outside, order a Paella and a pitcher of Sangria. You'll see what I mean!The pastas are also very good. At least as good as ""Il Forno"", in the south.The rest of the dishes are more uneven. Some are quite good, others weak.But overall, this is one of the best Spanish/Italian restaurants on the Island, definitely worth a visit. Just dont go there in the winter and dont expect much of the service (which should really be improved!).",El Sabor Latino
50,"I like their tasty pastas! Very nice atmosphere inside and good value for money! So try it, hope you will like.",El Sabor Latino
