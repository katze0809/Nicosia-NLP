50,One of the best live-music taverns in the city. the food is great and the price is okay considering that you are staying there for about 4 hours,Mezostrati tavern
30,"This is a place to party. Endless plates of mezedes (portions of various foods) are served as a standard. The mezedes are the usual palette of most tavernas but there are some specials (such as shitake mushrooms and fired courgette juliennes), What makes this place special is the ambience. Adorned with memorabilia of the distant past, black and white posters of former stars, old machines like typewriters, and the like, the live music it offers, naturally, is also from the past, famous Greek songs from the forties and fifties. This is a place to party while filling the hunger gap. It is great fun but I would say there are places that offer tastier mezedes. That is not to say they were not good. The grilled meats were succulent and the servings very generous, so generous that I could not manage my dessert but my companions said it was excellent. At about €22 per head plus drinks, it is good value for money if you want to party. Get there after 8 pm when service and entertainment start for real.",Mezostrati tavern
20,"The food is nothing special, service is OK, and live music is average.Points for accommodating allergies and alternatives.Although they have signs - some are entertaining- for smoking not being allowed, even employees can be seen putting off cigarettes in a glass. Breathing can be... Suffocating.",Mezostrati tavern
40,The tavern are nice the food fresh and the quality best value for money Quantity is excellent Helpful people there and testy plates Recommend the meze plates.,Mezostrati tavern
50,It's a hidden gem. Not visible from the road or when passing by in the car. I had a visitor from out of town and me being also out of town did a search for the closest taverna type restaurant. I did not have time to check reviews. I took a gamble and crossed my fingers. Result. Totally satisfied with everything. From the retro styling to the service. Excellent cooking. I highly recommend and to look forward to the next time.,Mezostrati tavern
40,"The restaurant is not ready to find....and we arrived early at 12.....place empty & first thoughts were to miss out. But we were lucky to have stayed cause the food & the place were fantastic. Greek food galore at its best,,,pork, fish, meat....dozens of plates with veg, chips, sausages ,......prices were reasonable. As a family of 5 with a 3 year old, we really had a great time seeing so many retro items in the place. Pity we missed the music & dancing.....!!!!",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Really nice place, large, but cozy. Located in the city center. Old photographs on the walls, retro devices. Great food, mostly local, pleasant atmosphere. Large dishes. English menu. Very hostile and friendly.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Googled restaurants in the area.. it had good menu and wine list so I tried it. When I arrived at 8 it was totally empty and they said, well, not sure where we can seat you .. we are totally booked.. i was like really? There is no one here. Well, i guess i wasn’t late to the party. It got packed. Not a table left unoccupied.. the food was spectacular. .and Christos served me.. he brought me halloumi on the house.. delicious and hot and fresh. A salty cheese. Then i got my main meal. Omg!! SO MUCH FOOD!! They said it was the Cypriot way.. i felt bad because i could not eat the whole meal. Pork kebabs and a specialty of Cyprus... some minced pork wrapped in lamb fat.. was delicious. The pork was super tender and delicious. The salad was your typical Greek amazing feta, cucumbers, tomatoes. Etc. and fries cooked so well they were amazing and i dont’ usually eat fries. He brought me on the house cherries, bergamot and eggplant.. sweet. I tried the bergamot. I said we only have that in massage oil. He laughed.. really? It was just like the taste you would think. Very delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. It got packed. The band started playing. I would recommend booking a table and enjoy this great Greek night!!",Mezostrati tavern
20,"Had a good time last night visiting this restaurant. Very friendly staff, food and price. They had Greek music too, so it was nice. We were really enjoying the moment.... until they were letting people smoke INSIDE and while we were still eating. It's against the law to smoke inside. The manager didn't seems to bother about that or do anything. It looks like he lets anyone smoke inside every time. I went home smelling like an ashtray. I will think twice to visit this place again. And I know some of my friends who will do the same. It was shame to spoil our evening for 5-6 people.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"We chose the place for our first meze experience in Cyprus and was very happy. I cant compare meze with other places, but all they brought was freshly cooked, tasty, lots of different grilled meat, cheese and snails on top. We took 2 person meze for 3 of us and was barely able to eat all. Tonns of food!On Sunday there was live music which created a good wibe. To hear it good, you must get table in the outside circle. In a high season may be need to book a place, seemed it can get super busy though the place is big",Mezostrati tavern
50,Best tavern to visit in Nicosia. Must visit when there is the live music. Try the meze for the full Cyprus experience,Mezostrati tavern
50,Great place for family and friends reunion. The food is very nice and they also have live music that creates a good amd relaxing atmosphere. Try it,Mezostrati tavern
50,"Went with a business colleague for an evening meal. Food was superb, service was very friendly and efficient. The real bonus was the live music - mostly Greek folk music and performed with so much passion and expertise. Overall a fantastic atmosphere!",Mezostrati tavern
50,huge portions and really tasty greek food. their delivery is prompt and food is freshly made and warm,Mezostrati tavern
50,"Had the best food there! My favorite was the chicken burger! I can’t get enough of it! I have been visiting Mezostrati since its opening and I must say the quality, quantity and atmosphere have been excellent. Highly recommended for family, friends and events! 10/10",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Among the best they told us and they were right!! We went with a couple of friends on a Tuesday night and we were delighted to hear old nice Greek music ""Rempetika"". The food was amazing and the people working there very friendly making the atmosphere even better!! I strongly recommend it!!",Mezostrati tavern
50,"If you love good traditional Cypriot food and live Greek music this is the place for you. Its right in the heart of Nicosia. The mezze had everything from grilled halloumi, lountza, souvlaki, sieftalia, delicious snails cooked in tomato sauce etc.Add in the cold draught beer and non stop Greek bouzouki hits to dance to you just don't want to leave.Thank you for an amazing night - I will be back!",Mezostrati tavern
40,A great place to relax with Greek music and good quality food. Nice atmosphere and excellent service.,Mezostrati tavern
50,The waiter was not selling the products and the quality of them at its best. Everything was really very jammy and not expensive!!!,Mezostrati tavern
50,big portions great food and atmosphere. their delivery is excellent as it comes on time and food is hot,Mezostrati tavern
30,"I don't know exactly what went wrong with this tavern. It used to be one of my go-to places for a variety of grilled meats but now this has changed. The souvlaki was obviously prepared hours ago and then reheated. Sieftalia was average, one meat dish was undercooked (something that looked like a sausage), another meat dish was harder than a rock etc. The chicken and the pork chops were good but we were having a meze so there was only one piece for each one of us.Another thing that bothered me was the fact that after 22:00 everybody smokes so it can be quite irritating.",Mezostrati tavern
50,Amazing meze which is highly recomended and also amazing live music some specific days of the week. Really friendly personel and amazing food!,Mezostrati tavern
50,"Excellent food, flexible and friendly service with live music made my stay this Sunday lunch to one of the best expirinces since years in the hospitality industry in Cyprus. Taste the house wine and choose several Cypriot specialities from the menu. You will feel the haven of Cyprus.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"We visited on a Wednesday night, the place was packed of people, an indication of a good place. Food was delicious and more than enough for us. Service was really good, with helpful staff. Entertainment was greek live music that kept going until after midnight.Highly recommended for couples, friends or family dinners.",Mezostrati tavern
10,"Until 10 o clock everything was good. The decoration was nice, the food tasty, the service ok.BUT at about 10:00 when the live music begun, people started smoking inside the restaurant with the silent approval of the staff. Soon the place was filled with smoke.Why do we have to suffer or have to leave because some people do not respect the others and the law? Why the management allows smoking inside the restaurant?",Mezostrati tavern
50,"This restaurant I recommend for birthdays and parties and friends reunions , especially on weekends when they have live music after 10 pm . I don’t know about the prices but the food and drinks are so traditional , and the feeling inside there is so warm and enjoyable!",Mezostrati tavern
20,"We visited this place in dec 2017 and our experience was really disappointing.. a person of our group was fasting and they brought their fish meze ...it was horrible! Cold plate full of potatoes ! The prawns were also bad!! And the worst was that this plate was charged for 22 euros.. same with the meat meze! With regards to the latter, there was not enough meat plates nor was there enough quantity.. only the music was nice!",Mezostrati tavern
40,"This place has great food (tavern). The music is live greek music and ""busukia"" related where people can dance in the center of the stage. It has sitting areas both inside and outside. We had a blast! We will definitely go there again!",Mezostrati tavern
40,"A nice typical Cypriot tavern with meze menu. We visited with a group of 20 people, food came fast and quantity and quality was very good. Nothing bad to mention regarding the food. The only downside is the price, we paid 32euro each with drinks. You can find same quality at half that price and in more quaint places.",Mezostrati tavern
10,"We had a reservation for 26 people , the service was horrible , they did so much mistakes that they charged us for, BUT the most ridiculous thing was the unacceptable discount of 1.14% of the total bill!",Mezostrati tavern
50,The place is well hidden and I would never visit it if not guided by the local. The food is great - both mezze and main courses are the best of Greek cuisine I ever tasted. Not too fancy - simply delicious.,Mezostrati tavern
50,"We went to this restaurant for graduation dinner and it was absolutely worth it. The atmosphere and the decoration were so cosy and relaxing! We ordered Cyprus meze. So many food options, so tasty and fresh. The staff was very gentle snd friendly. Absolutely recommended for any occasion!",Mezostrati tavern
30,"We used to come to this restaurant but after one time they served us with yesterday's salad and today with souvlakia made from destroyed meat, I doubt that I will come here again. Very disappointed(((",Mezostrati tavern
20,"The food was below average, I only liked the potatoes and the bread. The rest was simply bad, not to mention that their grilled chicken smelled terrible- it had gone bad !!!!We paid 25 euros per person- very , very expensive , we didn't eat, the music was so loud that we couldn't talk, the singers (? ) mediocre. Certainly NOT going there again.",Mezostrati tavern
50,Great atmosphere inside and outside the taverna. Excellent food meze combination for meat lovers and vegans. Very good music and the good news are that they offer different music choices from Tuesday to Sunday.,Mezostrati tavern
50,"we visit this place too often the place is the best value for money. good food, service and music. the singers and the musicians are different on Wednesdays, Friday and Saturday evenings and you have the chance to enjoy different types of singing.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Great ambience, Greek live music, big portions, a wide variety of meat dishes and a few selections for vegetarians too. Everything we tried was really tasty! The staff was extremely helpful and polite and made us feel truly welcomed. Complimentary dessert is served at the end of the meal. Great value for money. Will come back for sure!",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Great Taverna, with live music. A must if you want to feel the Cyprian way of life, with a lots of mezes.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Most people who go to Mezostrati go there for the traditional mezze but you can also choose other dishes, which are all belonging to cypriot cuisine. Even if you do not take the mezze, the quantity you get incredible, impossible to eat everything ! The food is good and the service is very friendly and efficent. We went on a saturday evening, lots of groups had booked, the atmosphere was very festive, especially as a band was playing. Try to book in advance. Mezostrati is locatd in the modern part of the city, but not far from the old city ( greek part).",Mezostrati tavern
40,"A very good tavern, in down town of Nicosia, suitable for a nice lunch but for dinner also. Good service. You should try haloumi with lardi...excellent!",Mezostrati tavern
40,"I visited Mezostrati on a Saturday evening and enjoyed traditional cyprus meze, good quality and quantity. Live music, great band. Only con is the seating arrangement, you don't get to watch the band if you are seated near the entrance or at the back and it's frustrating.",Mezostrati tavern
50,Amazing meze which is highly recomended and also amazing live music some specific days of the week. Really friendly personel,Mezostrati tavern
30,"This is a centrally located restaurant with live greek music. Before moving to its current location and changing it's theme, it was a lot better both in terms of quality of food and service.When we visited recently, it was packed with large groups of people which means it was quite noisy. Music was nice and made for a fun atmosphere with people having loads of fun.However, food was average at best and it compares even lower when you consider the price tag. Also, service was ok but definitely not what makes you say waoo....If we are invited, we will go, but we don't feel the need to go there without such a reason.",Mezostrati tavern
20,"I visited Mezostrati 1 year ago. It was a lot better, with great quantity and quality. This time, thank God we had some friends not so hungry, so I was able to eat their food too. Otherwise I was going to leave the place with an empty stomach. At least the meat was freshly cooked on fire. Also, none of their plates was traditional or cooked on kitchen/oven. In addition, even the price is higher compared to other places with better, tastier and much more food",Mezostrati tavern
50,"We have been here with some associates from work for lunch. We have tasted local specialties and different tastes. Good, clean, fast and affordable.",Mezostrati tavern
30,"This place is usually packed with large groups, so it's very noisy and busy. The food (we ordered meze) was average, and nothing special for what we've paid for. Service was good, though like the previous time.The house wine was awful, but live music was nice, if you are into this type.",Mezostrati tavern
20,"An ok restaurant with not exeptional food and simultaneously quite expensive. There are better and cheaper restaurants of the same category to try out in Nicosia. Usually meze restaurants serve a big variety of food in reasonable prices. At this one we paid quite a lot of money, tried the meze menu but still my company felt that something was missing in terms of quantity. Quality though is not bad, I liked the mushrooms cooked in that tasty sauce! Don't order the local bulk wine. It's horrible! We couldn't even drink it. I suggest to order a bottled one. The other negative remark is that we were a company of non smokers but felt so badly the smoke coming from the smoking area and that was very annoying!",Mezostrati tavern
40,"This tavern is located centrally in Nicosia with easy parking in the area. Place is big but it gets packed. Food is good, meze seems endless! Great atmosphere, live music and people dancing. Nice experience. What you would expect from a Cypriot tavern.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Nice local meze and a delicious desert, good service, polite waiters, excellent atmosphere and good music!",Mezostrati tavern
30,"We hangout with friends to this place when we want to dance greek songs and combine food with our night out.The food is ok, it serves traditional cypriot cuisine (mezes style). The food taste is average but me and my hubby consider ourselves supertasters. For our friends the taste is little more than good. The dishes don't offer that extra taste or twist that you can't find in any other traditional restaurant. However every time we go there we are always having fun! We dance till early morning and the staff usually waits for us to close down.A negative of the place is that it is really crowdy and noisy on Fridays & Weekends. Also the dance floor is really small for the restaurant's seat capacity...A positive of the place is that the interior is really nice and you can also jump to fun with the assistance of music.",Mezostrati tavern
50,Huge variety of meet and traditional cypriot and greek dishes! Always happy to have my meze! Great place and great food,Mezostrati tavern
40,"The environment was quite pleasant. The night we were there there was live music. The food was good, well cooked. However, it was little for the meze price per person.",Mezostrati tavern
30,"A good place to try traditional food. The portions are great, however the place which is often too busy is uncomfortable due to large groups and making the space quite small.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"A lovely restaurant for meze in Central Nicosia.The food is very good with healthy portions and the service is prompt.Their chicken biftekia (similar to burger) was amazing.We went for dinner and there was live traditional music which really lifted the atmosphere.All in all, a very pleasant experience.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"a local friend took us to this place - so no surprise - outstanding, really tasty meze, great service, lively atmosphere on a saturday evening - lots of young locals, live music and dancing and throwing the napkins (instead of the plates) ;).being used to non-smoking in public places, the smoking of some of the visitors surprised me... but no real complaint there. great experience overall, will definitelly visit again when next time in Nicosia!",Mezostrati tavern
50,"one of the best Cypriot restaurant in Nicosia!! Great food, very nice Cypriot music, friendly staff.",Mezostrati tavern
40,"This is the place we usually go to when we want to eat good meze. In my opinion it is one of the best, if not the best, in Nicosia. Decent distance between tables, high ceiling inside so you do not feel like you are eating with the people next to you. We never had problems with the service. My only issue (hence the 4*) is that sometimes there are people smoking inside which is a huge turnoff but this only happened to us once and we have been there lots of times (we like going there early and finish early when it is not packed).",Mezostrati tavern
30,"Was so packed full, had to squash past people to move, food was alright and lots of it. Worst thing was a lot of people smoking cigarettes in the restaurant and the deafening loud music -> everyone shouting...",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Great food , attentive and friendly service !!!!! Ask Sofoklis and he will help you for Cypriot meze! See you on my next trip , once thank you!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!",Mezostrati tavern
20,"music ok but the service was delayed and bad. Does not compare at all with tavern othellou1 for both food, atmosphere, music and entertainment.",Mezostrati tavern
40,"It does not let down. sometimes the food is late to arrive, but generally its very good and value wise its acceptable. Its one of the good places in town.",Mezostrati tavern
30,"We enjoyed the food and the sitting arrangement was OK (we were a big group). BUT, to let people smoke (and that's illegal) I find it, leniently to put it, UNACCEPTABLE. If you don't mind the smoke, go, if you do, NEVER show up there.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"What a find! A real Cypriot place, not a tourist in site! Excellent authentic food (no menus as such, just ""meze of the day"": selection of various dishes (appetizers, salads, mains and dessert) that waiters keep bringing to your table). Great ambiance with live music (we accidentally stumbled on the lunch with music (there was an organized celebration, a company party), however if I understood correctly there live music every night. And as there were people dancing during lunch hour, I would assume it's very lively at dinner time as well!An excellent value for money, a lunch for 2 with deserts and coffee and 1/2 liter of wine 24 euros!!! A steal!!Don't miss this place if you are visiting Nicosia, it's a short 5-10 minutes walk from Ledra store and Old Walled City, and an authentic, Cypriot tavern experience!Ps. It's on a big street, but a bit hidden away, don't miss it's narrow entrance (see photos attached)",Mezostrati tavern
40,1. Visit with a group of friends and we choose a variety of meat plates. More than enough quantity and good quality of food 2. A bit noisy due to the fact there was live music 3. Not expensive for what we get,Mezostrati tavern
50,This place is my personal favorite! Great food and a fun atmosphere is sure to make your night one to remember for long.Be ready to taste excellent cyprus dishes and dance till you drop!,Mezostrati tavern
50,"Surprised of visiting this place again and seeing that every time gets better and better. Nice food, nice music (a bit high volume) but for sure an excellent staff. We had meze for 3 (even that we were 4) and we left food back because it were too many. We shall be going very soon again. !",Mezostrati tavern
50,"This is just the best Cypriot Food in Cyprus. I have been here many times and never dissapointed Consistently excellent food, great service, great prices It is just the best",Mezostrati tavern
40,"Everything meets the customer's expectations. Good atmosphere, excellent food, very good service, and very good music band. The cost is a little High but the main problem is the fact that customers smoke inside.",Mezostrati tavern
30,"Standard meze dishes, nothing too exciting, not a lot of variety, but well cooked. It's the place to hang out with friends who like greek music and dancing. It's the kind of taverna that was missing from the city scene truth is!So, it's ok I guess! Not too bad! It's not for a romantic couple's night out!",Mezostrati tavern
50,we have been going here for over 5 years. they are the best in town. not easily found but perfect place for business lunch. dinners can be interesting too if you are into bouzouki. food is really good and daily dishes are well worth the visit.,Mezostrati tavern
50,"I visited the place last night for a party. The whole atmosphere was great and I was glad to visit this tavern for the first time. Super friendly staff and fast service. The food was tasteful while meze included lots of dishes. Great, live music from three guys.",Mezostrati tavern
20,"Went here for lunch and was not satisfied. TripAdvisor sticker on the doors but servise was really slow and super unfriendly. http://9gag.com/gag/ajnEg1q?ref=android just grabbed my fork to explain something and was playing with it for minute than put it back on table. I am not aq clean freak but I found this rude.Even tho we were only 2 guests in restaurant, we waited 40 minutes for food just to get black burned lamb chops and chclickan kebab. Than we had to wait another 30 minutes for bill.The food was nothing special the service bad. Not worth it going there.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"A great combination of food and live music (Friday or Saturday). A lot of fun, since people enjoy their meal and dance at the same time! Lots of smiles and great entertainment! Very good service, friendly and polite staff. Loved the decoration on the walls as well as the staff t-shirts.",Mezostrati tavern
50,excellent food either for lunch or dinner quality and quantity! great service and price! Must visit Friday or Saturday night live music!!!,Mezostrati tavern
40,"Despite last time's disappointment, I had to return for a hen party. Much better service, happier staff, and I was glad to find that new dishes were added to meze and meat (especially chicken souvlaki) was really good. Smokers again, are allowed to smoke in non smoking areas, and this makes it difficult for non smokers to stay long time and enjoy.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"The best place in Nicosia which combines traditional food with live music! Enjoy a selection of delicious Cyprus meze, while you listen to great music and dance to the rhythms of Opa! What an entertaining crowd! The service is great and the staff very friendly as well and the prices are beyond reasonable. I also love the intelligent quotes that are written all over the place, from the walls and shot glasses to the t-shirts of the staff! I will definitely visit again :))",Mezostrati tavern
40,"nice atmosphere live greek music and local meze.the service was fast and the waiters very polite, the quality and quantity of food excellent.musitians were playing very good music and the people were enjoying it so do i.Prices were good for what you get for.i enjoyed it.",Mezostrati tavern
20,"I went there just when I arrived to cyprus, so I wanted to try something traditional and I was disappointed. I am sorry if I will hurt somebody fillings but this taverna is just for locals(I get filling that I am not welcome there-well as I saw it is Cypriot tradition not to be nice to foreighners, but this is different subject).So we came there and we asked if its possible to eat,undo they were full(we didn't knew anything about place). They said to us no, but then somebody run after us that if we wait 10 min it is possible to get table. They sit us on high table where people put there glasses and come for smoke,since I am non smoker it bordered me but ok I was thinking 10 min later will be better. We ordered meze and they bring us there, undo several tables were leaving.i asked few times if it is possible to move to another table(many tables left allready)since this was not comfortable and our food was coming and people smoking directly to my face. Nothing happens so we ate our food which was nothing special actually beyond average and asked for bill since nobody attended us but we still wanted some wine.So getting the bill was another hard situation. We ask waiter 5 times if it's possible to pay!!! I was so pissed that I wanted to leave without paying. Then we went inside again 5 times ask for bill,like we are invisible. Apparently they have enough money....So overall experience was not nice, actually disgusted me taverns for a while. I guess if you are Cypriot they kiss your hands so maybe that's why everybody like it so much. Food was average,service horrible, ambient so so and very unfriendly.",Mezostrati tavern
40,"We visited the place with colleagues and it was really good for tasting various Cypriot dishes. We had lots of food (probably everything written on the menu). I liked most of the dishes, especially the haloumi and loutza ( traditional cheese and smoked pork loin, respectively). The red house wines could be improved.",Mezostrati tavern
40,One of the few places that can address different age groups in a very unique way. Very good food and nice atmosphere. On some nights there is also live music.,Mezostrati tavern
30,"This was our first time at the new place, which is much more bigger than the old place. We went on a Saturday evening and it was packed. We had a table inside, next to the band. Even though food at the old place was delicious, I am sorry to say that at the new place it was disappointing. Chicken arrived at the table uncooked, so we asked them to take it back. Staff seemed a bit confused and in a couple of cases they brought us several dishes twice (like potatoes). It seemed to me a chaotic situation was going on, that never occurred at the old place. On top of that, everyone was allowed to smoke inside which was very frustrating.",Mezostrati tavern
40,"Visited teh place twice at its new location and 3-4 at teh old location.Food is above average for a cyprus meze joint but the new place is a lot bigger and is a place where about 100+ can be served. There is also a live trio playing the typical partying classic greek zorba the greek repertoire mainly. Things get out of control especially if there are hen or bachelor parties there but hey it is a party place.The grilled meats are always quite good actually while the rest of the dishes are above average.This is the main difference between this and the old location which was mostly a lad's paradise where you could eat, drink sing a bit and go home.Waiters are attentive and unless you attempt to break tables by jumping on them while in a state of intoxication they are fast in bringing/cleaning tables and are customer oriented.Go there not for a quite evening out, otherwise order in some souvlaki and watch Sherlock.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Nice food, reasonable prices and excellent kind and human service. The hidden value of the taverna is the people working there. The owners seem to serve you at their own house. Reservation is needed.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"Everyone should try the best meze in town. It is located in the centre of the capital of Cyprus. Mezostrati offers great food in a perfect atmosphere, with live music during the weekends, so if you want to feel the magic you have to make a reservation many days before. It is really one of the greatest choices in Nicosia for the food lovers",Mezostrati tavern
50,"If ever in Nicosia don't miss the chance to eat at Mezostrati!Great food, the best meze in town, nice decoration and I can't say enough about the service!Some nights of the week they have live music and the mood gets really high, so make sure you try that experience. Make a reservation first to find a table since it's really popular those nights though.My personal favourite as a food lover!",Mezostrati tavern
30,"Since Mezostrati expanded it opperations and move to a new premise, the quality of food and service is below average, the only reason i rated it average is because of its new traditional design and feel of the new tavern.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"everything is nice, atmosphire, food, service and price value, friendly staff, in the centre of town, excellent for business lunch and lunch in general",Mezostrati tavern
40,Great Cyprus meze to be shared among friends. The tavern usually has live music every Wednesday evening and during weekends to accompany this wonderful culinary experience.,Mezostrati tavern

50,"I only was there once and I had the best chicken kebab I've ever had!However, I regret not ordering the traditional meze as they seemed to me really satiating and delicious and the people around us left extremely positive comments about them. As for the service, they were friendly and helpful.Surely we will be going again!",Mezostrati tavern
50,Tradition tavern with mezes. The food was great and the waiter was very patient in recommending us dishes. Try and get a table outside. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant!,Mezostrati tavern

40,Very good restaurant with live music in some nights .... the food is excellent and also the way of serving the food is amazing ... friendly staff ... average prices but you pay what you are getting for ...so it's value for money ... ! You must visit and taste it ...,Mezostrati tavern
40,"This is one of the best taverns on the island, with very good live Greek music. We ordered meze and every single dish was really delicious. Staff is both friendly and professional. You must make a reservation on Fridays and Saturdays. The only drawback is the fact that smoking is allowed inside, and this can be very unpleasant, as the place is small and ventilation lacks.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"The atmosphere is nice, prefer to seat outside in the summer. The food is great and the service is perfect. It is better if you book in advance, as the place is always full.",Mezostrati tavern
50,"I have been there several times for lunch and the food tastes homemade but proffesional at the same time, deicious, good quality with large portions. A bit overpriced maybe for everyday food.Last weekend I went there for dinner and they offered a great meze. I especially liked their pork souvlaki which is perhaps the best I have tried the last years. Their meze price was reasonable.I was also amazed to see that they have good live greek music (I assume only on Saturdays or Fridays- not sure), which was also great. The three musicians were of top quality with a good choice of old greek songs.I would say the best combination of quality food and quality greek music in Nicosia. The only bad thing is that the restaurant is small and there is not much space for dancing. If it was bigger though the atmosphere wouldnt be so nice and cozy.",Mezostrati tavern

50,Visited this place many many times for lunch with friends. The food is great. The menu is very good and in addition there are plates of the day that one could choose from.The portions are really rich. Food tastes great and fresh. Great wine and really great service. The quys working there really seem to enjoy what they are doing and are willing to serve the customers.Highly recommended for lunch.I have not visited the place on a night so i cannot comment on that.,Mezostrati tavern
50,"Most probably the best Cypriot food you'll have in Nicosia. The service is fast and efficient, and the flavours are mind-blowing! We went there with Cypriot friends who are regular patrons, thus vouching for its authenticity and lack of ""tourist trap"" feel. If you do go, try to avoid the upstairs seating only as it is totally separated from all the action downstairs. Everything we ordered was unbelievable and filling. We were a group of six and ordered mixed dishes (known as ""meze"") for five. This is where you just state the amount of people to be fed and the restaurant brings you a variety of their dishes. However, there was still a substantial amount left over. There was live music playing and by the end of the night, the whole place was up and dancing! As breaking plates is now forbidden due to safety concerns, management kept passing out napkins for us to throw at the patrons dancing (this is a sign of respect and enthusiasm). In short, you simply cannot go wrong with this restaurant! Great food, live music, positive atmosphere, pure Cyprus.",Mezostrati tavern

50,"I have visited Mezostrati many times in the past. Sometimes with friends, colleagues and others with family. Everything there is excellent. The atmosphere is warm and homey, the decoration is wonderful with old pictres, sayings and antiques (makes you want to keep on reading the funny sayings on the wall). The service is excellent and very friendly. And last, but not least, the food is great! Satisfying portions, big variety of meze, all excellently cooked and served.In the summer you can very well sit outside and accompany the food with nicely cooled beers. There is also a good variety of wines to chose from. One or two times in a week there can also be some live music with guitar and bouzouki.",Mezostrati tavern
