The dishes are unadulterated, they are cooked willingly, the service will be good, candles, hearts and good music for a better mood. Your special occasion or day can be even more unique if you are welcomed at domus.Everyone will be sure your holiday is unforgettable. One of my favorite specialties is steak Diane.. prepared according to a special recipe..It is a must try",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"DomusArrived in the dark and being a first time visitor I initially thought the restaurant was still completely empty at 2115 when I arrived. Almost considering to leave untill I noticed a couple taking an entrance which I hadnt noticed and they took the stairs up. Only then I found out that the restaurant is 1st floor and the lounge which was empty located on the ground floor.So just in time I also took the stairs up and found the cozy resto upstairs. With quite a number of people eating already. Being alone (I was on business trip) I still love to dine out and a full restaurant I prefer being on my own (although I get the once in while akward looks). But who cares, I dont at least.Then to the description of the evening.The sitting on the high tables with the rather small but high stools is a bit uncomfortable I must say. I noticed more people had issues with the seating. Would definity advise to change the setting for normal standard height tables and chairs. It will add to the comfort. The resto is very nice, dimmed light, good background music, different corners and chambers. Love the glass drops like a chandelier above some if the tables. Complement for the tasteful decorations.The food.The white bread served with olive oil and tapenade was old while the brown bread was crips much better and seemed fresh. Being alone at the table I took house wine by the glass, which was strangely enough not mentioned in the extensive wine list. But it was pointed out nicely by the waitress that they had also wines by the glass. Took a nice local Cypriotic white wine.I started with the Provincale Mussels which was simple and good. Mussels slightly overcooked but the sauce nice and creamy.Main course was served quickly after starter (could have take a bit longer).The Morrocan styled Salmon was cooked perfect exactly how salmon should be to my opinion. I understand the choice of rise (why not couscous) when you call it Morrocan Salom, but it didnt fit me. I ordered it because I was curious about the Morrocan Salmon idea. Killed the curiousity, but I wont order it again.Finished with a After-Eight icecream. Tasteful abd good to finish the meal with (like after-eights). The ice cream could have done with some more (and warm) chocolate poured over it.Bill adding up to ‚Ç¨60 including tipp.All-in-all I liked it. Will I go back? Will I recommend. Yes I will 2x.",Domus Lounge Bar

50,"This was the second time we visited DOMUS with a small corporate planned dinner. The experience is amazing, in a beautiful decorated place, excellent service and delicious food. Huge portions of mouth watering plates..",Domus Lounge Bar
10,"I went on date there last Saturday. First of all they sat us on a TOP uncomfortable table (you can not eat like this) next to the bar. It was 20.00 o'clock when we arrived and there was another couple next to us, so we asked nicely to move to a more compfartable table, the nice waitress came back and she said that they are fully booked (two tables) by the way, we made reservation two day in advanced. We ordered our food (very disent but nothing special) and there was No wine by class, only bottles....... We had our cocktails, eat our food, and we left at 22.10....still No parties arrived for the regular tables only 3 tables left and we all were sitting on a high tables with the uncomfortable high chairs......and paid for an overpriced meal.....",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Great service, amazing food & delicious,warm atmosphere ! one of the best place at Nicosia!! Must try!!! üòÅ",Domus Lounge Bar
30,My latest visit to this restaurant will be my last as food was very basic and service was poor but prices high!,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Had an amazing night at Domus last week. The food was lovely and service was above and beyond! We had starters, mains, and desserts and everyone enjoyed their meals. I would highly recommend it, we sat in the the restaurant upstairs and loved the decoration and ambience. The bar looked great as well!",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"Visited with my husband three weeks ago. We used to like this restaurant years ago but it was very expensive so we stopped going. I thought we could give it another try! When we entered I realized that nothing changed over the period of five years we did not visit. Everything looked run down and old. We ordered salad for starter, average. I ordered the stuffed chicken which I did not like , it was too sweet. The steak of my husband was too hard. We did really want to risk it with desert. I would not recommend this place",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Wonderful food,service and atmosphere. Excellent Wine list !Always the best choice for romantic dinner. The most amazing restaurant in Nicosia, totally worth to be visit!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,This restaurant has amazing food and of course is value for money. The staff are professional. Is like michelin awarded restaurant.,Domus Lounge Bar
40,"If you are looking for a good dinner, Domus is a safe choice. Menu is big, including starters, pastas, fish and meat. Many of the dishes can be served either as starter or as main course (the catalogue has two prices next to those plates). Beef carpaccio was good, salads were fresh and steak Diane was tender and tasty. Wine list is adequate and service was friendly and efficient. Prices are moderate to high.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"This definitely is the best restaurant we visited in old Nicosia -- and the best by far. The location is attractive, the atmosphere pleasant (apart from the music, which was too loud). Service was professional and friendly. What stands out, however, is the quality of the cuisine: excellent by any international standard. For starters we had duck carpaccio and pate & cherries, both fine. For our main course we had braised lamb shanks and beef filet: both came with delicious, totally different sauces. As observed by other reviewers, it is not cheap by local standards, but quite reasonable when compared with Western European restaurants. Highly recommended.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"nice food, great ambiance. i recommed it. Prices are very fair as well. Good location in old town nicosia. I would go there again.",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"The decoration and ambient atmosphere is very beautiful. I found the lighting too dim for my own liking and sight, it made seeing difficult. Waiters were OK, polite, perhaps not as attentive as I hoped (given that it was a Tuesday night and relatively empty). The main dishes were late to be served. I had a steak - the meat wasn't anything special, it was indeed cooked to my liking (medium rear), but definitely not worth 30 euro. All in all, the restaurant's decoration and ambience is remarkable, but the food is unremarkable, and overpriced. Verdict: not going back on my own, unless invited.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"Somewhat seggregated from the competition, it's located in one of the most historic places in Nicosia: opposite the Archdiocese and the Pancyprian Gymnasium, two landmarks of the capital. While you can find more inspired cuisine elsewhere in Nicosia these days, it's definitely worth a visit for its stylish ambiance",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Great food and a great atmosphere. A very pleasant experience. Service was good, and overall great restaurant",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"A restaurant with potential, amazing quality food, really tasty and a not over complicated menu. Great selection of wine and other drinks.Service on the other hand needs urgent attention..arrived and there Was no one at the entrance, there is a bar section downstairs which was empty, so our group decided to inspect upstairs as we smelt food...low and behold, this is were the welcome desk is and people..We at at a table which was shared with other people, no problem, there was in a glass and tissue some cut up bread that we went even told was there to have, it was just discovered out of curiosity..Towards the end, we requested for the Bill, 20 min later asked someone else, 10 min later it slowly arrived...10 min later we went to the front desk to pay...Other than that ambience is magical...I would recommend any gentlemen looking to charm their lady to go there, very romantic and great music...just stay on too of the service..",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Simply the best ! Probably one of the best restaurants in town ! Very good food, amazing atmosphere and really good and friendly staff !üëçüëç",Domus Lounge Bar

50,Amazing place with very nice food and excellent atmosphere. A bit expensive but definitely worths it.,Domus Lounge Bar
50,When visiting nicosia we have always enjoyed delicious meals at your lovely restaurant. The only issue that caused some discomfort was the overly flirtive manner towards my husband by your waitress but we put this down to her generally immature demeanour. However our latest visit was made extremely uncomfortable as she blatantly ignored my presence and i asked her to leave us. She went on to distract your other staff until i visited the washroom at which point she returned to my husband who also asked her to leave. I complained to your waiter who did not seem to understand what i was saying and requested to speak to the manager to which i was informed that he was unavailable. The final straw came a few minutes ago when we realised she has also sent my husband a friend request on socialmedia which naturally was declined. I am sure you agree that this is unacceptable behaviour for a member of staff working at a high class and otherwise excellent restaurant.We are planning a double celebration for our thirty fifth wedding anniversary on new year eve and were considering coming to you with between twelve and sixteen guests. If she will be anywhere on the premises we shall be forced to go elsewhere. Please inform us of what action will be taken,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"We visited this place on our anniversary for the first time. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the service and everything we ordered (rocket salad, grilled steak & pesto chicken) was delicious and the quantities were satisfying.The cheese cake we ordered for dessert was heavenly and I recommend to anyone visiting.The dishes do take some time to be prepared but honestly this makes the experience even more satisfying.The prices are pretty reasonable and I definitely recommend.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Great food amazing ambiance Really loved it, very good food and the music was excellent Well done Keep it up",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"we went a group of 10, the food was very nice and the deserts excelent, the service was also very good, but one thing that realy annoyed me, and i mean realy, was that they charged us for the water that we did not ask for, granted most people drank the water but they should have at least let us know.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"We had a wonderful time at Domus. It is expensive but in my opinion worth it.If you want to have a special night, this is definitely the place to go. The food is really good, except the salad! The personell was very attentive and friendly!If you want to splurge for food, this is the place to go!",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"The restaurant is based for a long time in center of all Nicosia town. Nice atmosphere, music and waiter services. In spite of the fact of really cold weather we had to seat outside. Blankets were imminently available from very polite waiters.Unfortunately the quality of food was rare, cold and disappointment. Beef steaks were very Taft and very heavy pepper sauce. Spinach as accompaniments is old fashion, especially when is the only veg in dish. Hope to see better quality in our next visit.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,Amazing and top quality super flavoured food served in one of the most scenic places in Nicosia. Excellent service and friendly staff. The rissoto was delicious!!,Domus Lounge Bar

50,one of my favourite places..great location..great style..great atmosphere..great service....and best of all...great food !!!prices are reasonable for the quality !!,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"We visited Domus last week for dinner and the overall impressions were great. The salmon and steak dishes were cooked to perfection, seasoned properly and very tasty. Definitely worth a visit if you like fine cuisine!!!",Domus Lounge Bar
10,"Our recent experience was a very poor one. The food was poorly presented and the taste was below average. All the dishes we were served totally lacked imagination. It reminded me of food that was served back in the 80's! The least I can call a main dish where the whole plate was covered in sauce, and underneath were pieces of chicken and rice (with chopped carrots!) is disappointing. No dish managed to stand out and exceed average. To be fair, the service and the ambience were ok. In any case, way too expensive for what it is. We will definitely not be going back.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"We went with a friend and were very pleased with everything, the music was relaxing just like the atmosphere, pretty lights everywhere and overall we had a very good time. Cocktails are expensive but top, will come again",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"One of the best restaurants in Nicosia!Excellent food,excellent service! Unique design both of the restaurant snd the lounge bar..Simply perfect!",Domus Lounge Bar
30,The food was very good. The staff responded to all our requests as expected. Unfortunately the price is unreasonably high. A pasta with smoked salmon is charged 20 euros. I had the same dish in Corfu 3 days ago in a truly Italian restaurant and I paid 11 euros.,Domus Lounge Bar
30,"Food was nice but a bit expensive we would say. Environment was romantic, music was lovely, service was really good.. it worths a visit!",Domus Lounge Bar

50,i have been a client of this place since it opened almost twenty years ago. Unique place with great food :-),Domus Lounge Bar
20,"I went there for a romantic dinner. I was disappointed by the service, food and atmosphere.To start, the service was not pleasant and the waitress didn't know the dishes.I order a salad for starter and it was really bad I ate only one bite.For main dish I had the chicken with the potatoes and carrots on the side. The carrots had the taste of unfrozen vegetables. The chicken and potatoes were just OK..nothing new to me.overall the quality of the food was low and the price high and one major problem for me the stuff was not friendly .I will not visit again this restaurant.",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"Limited amount of vegetarian/vegan options. There was only one risotto suitable for vegan and one eggplant role which was vegetarian (stufed with cheese). I was forced to have fish even though im plant based due to this lack of options (i had the aubergine the 1st visit). The fish was OK, nothing special if im honest. My husband had the mushroom risotto which was served scorching hot, it took 10 minutes before my husband could touch it. Once he could eat it, it was tasty. We ordered a salad for starter which was meant to have ""cranberries"" in it, and instead it had chunks of some kind of red jelly? It was horrible. Quite expensive. This was our Second visit, dont think we'l visit this place again.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,Great assortment of plates and drinks! Very nice quality of fresh salads and food. Nice indoor/outdoor seating. Food is a bit pricey but worth the money.,Domus Lounge Bar
50,If you are looking for a dinner to remember then look no further! Probably the best restaurant in Nicosia overlooked personally by Marios it's owner and chef by profession. Impeccable service and excellent food combined with a cosy atmosphere inside. The outside area open for 7-8 months is very romantic having as setting nicely lit old buildings in a very quiet area of old Nicosia. Highly recommended!!!,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Excellent service, delicious food and coctails... a place to recommend to others for visiting ....!!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,Always tasty...I went several times and i am always surprised and pleased. The food is tasty and the presentation even better! very good service! must try!,Domus Lounge Bar

50,Very special and delicious meals in so nice environment. The staff is professional and very friendly.,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Excellent food! excellent atmosphere! we always visit Domus to celebrate special occasions. Prices are a bit high,its value for money though. You get what you pay!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"The only negative thing I have to say about Domus is that sitting on a narrow pavement, subjected to the noise of passing traffic and having to inhale the fumes of car emissions while drinking expensive wine, is neither enjoyable nor romantic. Turning on the a/c and sitting indoors during the summer months, especially with the high humidity, is much more preferable.Having said that, the food is excellent. One cannot go wrong with any of the dishes. The wine is a bit on the expensive site, especially since one's pallet is spoiled by the fumes of passing vehicles.One of the best restaurants in Nicosia.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Amazing food, great service, nice selection of wines! We were outside in the street, with candles around, and very soft music in the background so you can talk and enjoy your food without being bothered!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"If you want to tuch some very different you must visit Domus..This is one of the best restaurant that I have been in Cyprus.If you want to feel the magic of this wonderful place,you must go there..At Domus everything is perfect for many unforgettables nights..",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Amazing food, possibly the best I can remember having, and beautiful presentation as well as a very interesting and attractive overall ambience, decoration and music included.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"We came to celebrate a big birthday and it was the perfect place if you want to wear elegant dress and have a classy dinner. The lighting was dim but helped with the soft, jazzy ambience. Decor was great, food was great, and service too. The only thing was that you have to pay for the water by bottle, and they keep pouring unless you say stop. Easy to find with gps and really good value for what you get!",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"We went here on Valentines night.The restaurant is nicely decorated,it has a nice romantic and seclusive vibe. The menu was set and unfortunately included items I do not choose to eat-such as liver-but my date enjoyed all the dishes.I would recommend having different choices for such nights-what about your vegan customers?-and also seemed a bit pricey. I would visit again to check out their whole menu",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"I visit Domus as a guest in a business/friends dinner.The place is amazing with the small ""privet"" corners to make you feel like you are very special treated.They have what I call ""discreet luxury"".I took the steak and it was perfect cooked as I asked.I will definitely visit the place again the next time I will be in Cyprus.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Now this was a pleasant surprise..Cannot praise this place enough, the design is out of the ordinary anddefinetely a step ahead of all the places we visited on the island.The food was also great and the portions more than you would expect in sucha quality restaurant, excellent service!",Domus Lounge Bar
40,The Domus Lounge Bar is located in the old town and it offers great fusion food which is unique. It has great atmosphere. Lttle bit pricey though.,Domus Lounge Bar
30,"We were treated to dinner by local Nicosian freinds who rated this place very highly for business engagements. Sure enough the place doesn't lack charm, situated in the old town near the Archbishop's Palace with outside seating (right on the pavement) in lantern-light serving well presented food from a fairly diverse menu. I loved the atmosphere and I loved my salad starter but I have to say the duck main course was tough and disappointing albeit accompanied by a fine risotto. My wife's prawn dish in ouzo cream sauce was super-rich too.Inside the bar area (recently refurbished I understand) looked funky and welcoming.I think its pricey but I didn't pay so cant really comment on price other than to say my host would most certainly only have selected a good spot. I would recommend the place but I would order differently next time if i'm lucky enough to go again.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"I liked Domus! It was very quiet but we ate outside in the street where the service was good and we were well looked after. The cannelloni and prawn/avocados were fine and the presentation of the pate, chutney and bread sticks in jam jars was, well different but successful! The lamb shank was big and tasty; the duck properly cooked and served m/rare and the sea bass a delight. The chocolate fondue was a great finisher but with a couple of bottles of wine at 27 euros each, the meal was nearly 200 euros which was a lot for three people? I'd go again though, the ambiance was great!",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"Excellent atmosphere, all details well attended, relaxing music, well presented food, great tastes.... But we had to pay ‚Ç¨17 for literally one bunch of rocket, which costs ‚Ç¨0,30 cent at the market. Is this respect for the customer? Do the expect us to go again? Anyway, the (‚Ç¨28 200gr) steak was so as soft as cream and was very tasty.Tip: the pepper steak is very nice and soft, but so spicy that you loose touch with taste at the end. Maybe you should order the plain one otherwise remove the sauce.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"The food served was excellent, nicely designed on the plate. The atmosphere is perfect. I went for a company dinner last June and was not disappointed! Staff are professional and always helpful. It's quite expensive but you gonna love Domus! I will definitely be back for more during the summer. My compliments to the staff, chef and management. Well done!",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"I will never get bored of visiting this place - I have been a frequent patron a long time now and it never fails to amaze me with the quality of its dishes, cozy environment and exceptional service. One recommendation that I have though is for the menu to vary a bit more frequently so as to keep customers interested in the long-run. The prices could be a bit lower too, especially when these are compared to similar restaurants/courses. Apart from the above minor comments Domus has proved itself as one of the best dining options in Nicosia, and it will stay like this for many many more years.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Domus is definitely in a league above most restaurants in central nicosia. We were welcomed by a friendly member of staff and led upstairs where the tables are placed in a number of small connected rooms.Furniture is classy, trendy and comfortable. The light maybe a bit too subdued. It just enough to read the extensive menu.Had a salmon carpaccio for a starter, followed by a pasta dish. Great food, delicately cooked. The portions are very generous, a bit too generous. No room for desert.Service is excellent!!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"My first impression of Domus was exactly what I was expecting when I entered the ambient styled house in the old city. We were greeted with smiles and made to feel instantly comfortable and relaxed. This was our first time here and it was a wonderful experience that both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed especially as it was his birthday. Service was excellent, food was amazing and the wine was good. The atmosphere was relaxed and romantic which we both loved. I recommend it for your special someone. I will definitely be back for more during the summer.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"Very nice birthday treat recently at Domus. Quirky d√©cor which is fun! Portions are large but we asked for a doggy bag to take away, living not far it was possible so very scrumptious lunch the next day too. Is reasonably expensive so really for celebrations/special meals. The staff were attentive and our children were welcomed though there is no kids menu starters were fine for them. Dinner starts at 8pm so we were 1st for dinner not making it too late. Would certainly go back again!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Very nice interior and amazing food!! I went for a company dinner and was not disappointed! The food served was excellent, nicely designed on the plate. The atmosphere is perfect!",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"The place must have been amazing in 2004, but seems a little dated in 2014.The food is good, but the portions could easily be a little smaller with more emphasis on better ingredients.Would want to try it again another time as we had a pleasant evening.For 2 persons each enjoying 2 courses and sharing a dessert and a glass of wine each cost ‚Ç¨ 80,-",Domus Lounge Bar
50,Everything was perfect!we went there for dinner for our 5th anniversary and it couldn't be better! great service!excellent food!perfect atmosphere!a must go if you visit Nicosia!,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Domus restaurant combines everything! High quality food, excellent service and perfect ambiance! Keep in mind though in mind that you are paying for the excellence mentioned above but it worth's every penny!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"My husband and I visited Domus restaurant recently and were pleasantly surprised...the service was TOP, if I can use this word. It was better than excellent. We had 5 people serving us, everything was on time, drinks, starters, food. The wine in our glasses was re-filled constantly without looking for a waiter. The food was very tasty , well cocked and many chooses for people who are fasting unlike in the other restaurants in Nicosia.My compliments to the staff, chef and management. Well done!If we have such a services and a quality of food in most of the places in this island then it gives me a hope that we can live in a civilize country.Thank you very much.Irina Tryfon",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Wonderful food, chic and stylish atmosphere with a cosy feel. Food is excellent and the price is on the high side but you really do get what you pay for so worth every penny. Love the lounge music and each corner in the restuarant has its own perosnal touch, no chair or table is the same. Staff are professional and always helpful, theres nothing negative I can say about the place. Love it!",Domus Lounge Bar

50,All is excellent food and place is very class restaurant the staff is professional beautiful restaurant very comfortable seat,Domus Lounge Bar
30,"I like the wooden panel decoration, the ceiling is quite low as well. It is quite small is could fit about 40 people at a squeeze. The bar service was quite slow which is why it receives only 3 stars.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"We visited Domus Lounge Bar & Restaurant for a special occasion. The environment is really nice and different from any other place we have been in Nicosia. However, we would prefer it to be a little bit more luminous. The service is typical for this kind of restaurant. Actually, this is a restaurant where you expect the waiter to fill in your glass when you have just drunk a swig. I have to admit that this, most times, makes me feel very uncomfortable, but if you like it, you will not be dissapointed. Regarding the food, we ordered pork fillet and duck with orange, salad and some red wine. Our plates were well cooked, and very well decorated, but I think, not amazing. I would like to clarify that, since this is not an ordinary restaurant, and since it is a bit pricey, the expectations are much higher. The bill was around 60 euros for 2 persons. Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner and I think that I would revisit Domus, maybe in another special occasion.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"While I'm not much for Domus choice of decor, there is no denying its a good spot for a drink and/or dinner as well. The food is great quality and priced similar to other Nicosia establishments.The building is unique and on par with great traditional buildings elsewhere. Better lighting and less kitsch type decor would put it over the top in my opinion, but, if what they've done has worked this long who am I to say. Definitely worth a visit.",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"The food is nice, tasty and a bit expensive. I would have given a 4/5 in everything if they hadn‚Äôt (initially) charge 5 bottles of water.. We were sitting outside - the outside sitting consists of several small tables on the pavement. The waitress opens a bottle of water, fills your glass(es) and then moves to the next table and does the same. So you don't really know how much water you had. They charged 5 bottles but we had much less so we complained to the manager, and he tried to convince us that they would never do such a thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ After a long discussion he charged us only two bottles and he offered to buy us drinks.",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"we were there again last saturday and were very disappointed.people were polite and attentive and very helpful but our food was just average.our salmon carpaccio turned out to be the supermarket cooked salmon slices with fresh dill. The fresh mashroom carpaccio was better but of no special taste.our main dishes were overall disappointing. My shrimp salad was huge, packed in a square ball that i couldnt mix and had a really poor quality 1000 island sauce. The risotto was not properly cooked and the wine was too 'strong' in the dish. the chicken was acceptable. the pepper steak was drawning in its sauce though the meat was tasty and rightly cooked. the desserts were just icecreams with a touch of chocolate sauce. time to change them please!well i wont say more but it is a shame as this place has great potentials and with a minor upgrate and more attention to taste and ingredients it can really improve.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,a very nice restaurant!!beautifully decorated with an aristocratic ambiancethe food is marvelous!! the risotto is cooked at perfection and the mushroom steak was one of the best i had in nicosiathe deserts are exciting and very freshreservations needed well ahead if you plan a special occasion,Domus Lounge Bar
30,"This restaurant is a joy to visit during summer months when the seating is outside on the pavement. During winter when everything is moved inside it becomes rather uncomfortable.It needs new tables, new seats, new lighting.Food is nice but the menu needs to change at least twice a year.Also service needs to become more attentive and more quick.",Domus Lounge Bar

30,"We went to Domus after having read that large amount of positive reviews on your website. And yes, the setting is beautiful. And yes, it is a beautiful house and very well decorated.There is a large menu to choose from, albeit not very original. But it is one of the most expensive restaurants in town and when you pay that amount of money you expect good food. The bottom line was that we could not really appreciate our food because the chef had decided to put tons of salt on everything. ruined our night.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,Atmosphere is amazing especially in summer time when the tables are placed outside and you can enjoy the beauty of old nicosia. Indoors decoration is also quite spectacular. Service is not quite what i was expecting(dont respond fast) but they are very kind and willing.I ordered salmon carpaccio which was just wonderful. Quite pricey but quality doesn't come cheap worth it all the way!!,Domus Lounge Bar
50,This restaurant is located within the Nicosia walls in a quiet neibourhood.If you sit outdoors you will be looking at the Holy Archbishopric and the historical Nicosia library.Thew food is among the best I have tasted in Nicosia and the service is very good.They have a huge selection of wines and cheeses.The atmoshere and decoration are beautiful.

50,"I had dinner yesterday, 21th August.The place is really Charming, with curtains and Very well prepared tables outsided.The staff is kind and ready to suggest the best Wine. We took beef and FISh and were suggested to drink a white cypriot wine. No need to say it Was excellent!The beef filet Was exquisite, with a Great mostard sauce and Two rich side dishes (included in the price).The dessert Was the best...a Great chocolate souffl√© that i Will remind forever.The bill Was 37 each one.

50,"I use the word orgasm since I think there is not any other word that can describe the food experience in Domus. Trust Marios, the owner and head chef of the place, simply trust him and I guarantee you that your perception of food will change and probably you will think more than once to fast food again in your life. I have tasted the most perfectly cooked fresh red tuna fish, a steak that seemed made out of butter, shrimps married in the mediterranean and inspired in Japan.... Simply go for it not you will not regret it, what you will regret is that you did not dine at Domus before.....",Domus Lounge Bar
40,Domus is an all time classic restaurant in the heart of the old part of Nicosia.The interior is lovely ( modern chic) and the veranda is amazing during the summer nights.The food is of a standard high quality.Mediterranean food served with a twist. Best and freshest ingredients are used.Desserts are also great ( souffles are amazing).Stuff is helpful.Do try also the drinks and the nibbles at their ground floor bar!,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"It's excellent for people who want a relaxing night with friends with a variety of wonderful cocktails and wines. The place is also perfect for a romantic dinner in a quiet location of old town. I didn't try their food though, but when I went before 2 weeks it was crowded so you've better make a reservation.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"I have visited Domus restaurant recently to celebrate my girl freends' birthday. We love Domus for its modern cuisine and fresh food, for its stylish decoration and for the good variety of wines. The location of the restaurant is unique, as it is located in medieval center of Nicosia, in a close proximity to the Archibishob's residence, Pancyprion gymnasioum and Hadjigeorgaki's Cornesios residence- an area full of Cyprus' history. I' ve being in Domus for several occations, with friends and family, and I must state that the atmosphere, food and wine has always being a pleasant and enjoable experience for me!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Great place, superb food and atmosphere! Been there with friends and really had a great time. A must visit once in Nicosia!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"I visited Domus few days ago with friends. I was having difficulties in choosing my meal and (luckily enough) in the end I followed the chef's recommendation for a salmon burger. It was an excellent meal, light and at the same time very tasty! I loved the combination of the ingredients. I also followed the owner's recommendation for my wine which was indeed amazing!Atmosphere is lovely, cozy and elegant at the same time. Music is at the right volume so that it doesn't distract conversations. I'm definitely going there again, I'm very curious to try their risotto which from what I've heard from friends has a very good reputation!Absolutely recommended, for a date, a night with friends or even a business meeting!",Domus Lounge Bar
50,Exceptional dishes for every occasion. The wine and starter were also amazing. Kudos to the waiters for the excellent service as well! The atmosphere both outdoors and indoors is great! Money well-spend! Would definitely recommend it.,Domus Lounge Bar

40,"The 'Domus' has held its well deserved, I believe, presence in the Nicosia smart society circles for years now. The secret of its success lies in the uncrowded arrangement of the tables giving the impression of private dining experience, the impeccable service, the more than passable food and the presence of the vibrant lounge bar on the ground floor for before or afters.The first floor restaurant is divided into the many smaller rooms of the restored 19th century mansion it is housed in. The d√©cor here is dark, baring plush red velvet similarities to a 19th century Parisian bordello, albeit of an upmarket, elegant and tasteful variety, and highlighted with touches of late 20th century design. The lounge bar on the ground floor is light and airy, avoiding all the glass and minimalist fashionable commonplaces with a clever use of a plank wood motif.Service is impeccable from the moment you arrive until the complementary liqueurs and coffee.The cuisine is a take on european fusion food, including Italian, generic Mediterranean, nouvelle French touches and with many healthy options. If I have a gripe it is that it panders to Cypriot taste rather than attempt to educate it. The table is tastefully set with tall desert glasses standing for bread baskets. After a beautifully presented amuse bouche of salmon mousse on biscuit courtesy of the chef, our starters of rocca salad, salmon carpaccio (needed more acidity/lemon?), stuffed aubergines and the exceptional pate with cherry compote went down well with my guests. The main courses received mixed comments. The rigatoni with salmon in vodka sauce were surprisingly 'al dente' but could have done with much less or the complete absence of cream. The pork fillet stuffed with wild mushrooms was well executed and tender. My friends declared the chicken Dijon to be the best of the mains. For desert we tried the chocolate souffl√© and the healthy option raspberry yoghurt with ice cream.The wine list is short for such a classy restaurant and needs updating. With a choice of Boutari Moschofilero and Muga Rioja, the Domus doesn't come cheap at more than ‚Ç¨60 per person.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,At my last visit the atmosphere was wonderful as always. The waiters were polite and we had good overall service. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the food this time as one of our meals was cold and we asked for it to be warmed up and our medium-rare stake turned out medium-well done.,Domus Lounge Bar
50,"I agree with what people write about Domus. It was my first visit to the restaurant last month and I was impressed.Decor is beautiful and different from any other restaurant. I expected it to be crowded although a week day but it was not. Just very few tables. Lighting is very poor and this would be one thing to maybe find negative.Way too dark. I understand it adds to the atmosphere but it is way overdone. Food was excellent! We had sea bass and chicken al pesto which were super tasty in good portions! Timing was perfect! Dessert was delicious (we had the lava cake with ice cream). Portion is very big and surprisingly much bigger than other places I had this. Maybe dessert itself it was not 10 out of 10 but nearly there (I would give 8 to 9 which makes it almost excellent). I found that food in Domus beats the desserts at least for my opinion. I will agree that prices tend to be on the upper scale especially if you have a bottle of wine but worths it! It's a place for these different, special occasions! Don't miss it! Surely returning.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"A place with excellent atmosphere. The service is great and accommodating. In regards to food, they've got great choices, the quality is excellent and the prices are not very expensive. In general it's a place worth going.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"Having come to Cyprus for past 26 years and married to my Cypriot wife for same length of time I was keen to find a top class restaurant in Nicosia where I could take my wife's family out for a nice evening meal that we are are spoilt for choice in London.Domus certainly looked to tick all the boxes. Beautiful setting in old walled part of town with an enticing romantic setting reminiscent of an old Italian villa. We sat outside on beautifully set tables and sofas with drop down lanterns above our heads that really set the scene for a delightful evening.However whilst the setting and menu looked impressive I do feel that the service needs to try a little harder.Upon arrival it's always nice to be asked if we would like an aperitif before dinner but I had to ask a waiter after 10 minutes for this to arrive.My starter was excellent however my Steak Diane was more then medium/rare more like medium/well done and my mash was luke warm at best.I also asked for a glass of red wine that had obviously come straight out of the fridge! I know in some people class this as a new trend but not in most.One of my party was also served the wrong main course but she then had to wait another 20 minutes for her meal to arrive by which time we had all finished ours.When the meal eventually came there was no offer of an apology for the wait.Having said all that we will try again due to the setting and 70% good food however please just do not rest on ambience and setting alone, it is the food that counts.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,i think that this place deserves at least one star at Michelin guidewe were amazed by the whole setup!!Absolutely perfect service and excellent dishesDesserts are not to be missed!!!Reservation is to be considered if you have a special occasion since it seems to be busy even on weekdays ‚Äì we were there on TuesdayNo negative remarks at allBravo!!,Domus Lounge Bar
40,"Not much - if anything at all - can go wrong with a night / meal at Domus. Although this restaurant has been around for well over a decade, it never falters on quality, variety, originality or clientele. Reserve well in advance, ideal for couples, but also for small groups of friends. The upstairs eating area is unique - private and luxurious. The food has never let me down, not one single time, either in originality, taste, or quality. I would definitely recommend it as a restaurant for special occasions and fine dining.",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"Its a great restaurant overall! The food is good as well as their service. Its a good place to eat and/or have a drink. In the summer, it offers outdoor sitting as a restaurant and is romantic but still good to hang out with friends. Its not located centrally so sitting outside during summetime is quiet. The backround music is not making it noisy. Still the prices are a bit high but its an above the average restaurant!!",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"Domus provides you with the stability you need some times when dining out. The quality is normally good and the service very professional. The wine selection is also good, while the atmosphere, even if the decor in its effort to be ""grand"" actually comes out rather kitschy for my taste, contributes to a nice evening out. Recommended.",Domus Lounge Bar

40,"I was there on Thursday night for a late dinner, we went at 10:00. The set up outdoors is very nice and you could tell that you would have a good restaurant experience from the first moment. Service was very good by experienced and professional waiters, wine list was good as well although I would have liked a bit more variety on New World wines and dessert wine by the glass. Food was good but not fine dining. We both had the tuna for main course and although it was cooked correctly the Chef could do much more on taste. I will give it one more try before I decide, after 15 years of being a hotel manager I know what I want.Overall a good experience I will definately go back and the prices are reasonable taking into consideration the whole experience. Also the background music was excellent.",Domus Lounge Bar

30,"I have been twice, and never really liked it or disliked it, although I was both times invited.First time was in winter, and I was impressed by the intimacy of the place, Stark designed chairs etc. But environment was very loud and I couldn't share conversation with my husband because of the noise (of both music and customers). Food was satisfactory. I didn't pay but I know it was above our usual spendings, and too much for what we had according to my husband jugement.Second time was summer with a friend, who had special thank to give me, so didn't mind about the price. Then I proposed that place.We sat outside and the environment was kind of magic. But...The waiter didn't have a clue about what he was doing, just standing along in a soldier pose. We could hardly grab our bottle, located far away from our table and we finally kept it with us.Food was very nice (we had beef carpaccio, difficult though to make a bad one except if meat is not fresh), but portions were very poor for the price. Although it was qualified as main dish, we both had to order a second portion to satisfy our hunger (and we had starters before).I meet most of the comments left here, nice but ...I would keep it for special occasions only.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"Best service in city, amazing collection of wine, excellent menu, inspiring decor.",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"The food is ok, with massive portions and good meat dishes. The pasta was a bit overcooked and the lamb was fantastic. The decor is a bit kitch in a good way, being in an old house. The bar is quite cool too.The big problem of the restaurant is its prices. 20‚Ç¨ for prosciutto with ""melon chaviar"" which came with 5 pieces of grapes instead was extreme, so as 18‚Ç¨ for a tiny fondue.",Domus Lounge Bar

40,"The old house converted into a restaurant/lounge bar/club provides a good combination for dining and then clubbing.The food is very good, imaginative and well presented with a wide variety of dishes rather on the expensive side though. Seating can be a bit uncomfortable expecially on the ""stools"" & high tables..(Choose the chairs). Service is very good. After 11.00pm it gets rather noisy as the music gets louder so if you prefer a ""quiet"" dinner better go round 9.00pm. Very pleasant in summer for dinner where you can sit at the few tables placed on the pavement in the cool summer breeze. Definetely worth visiting.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"There is a reason everyone is leaving such excellent reviews for Domus.It has always been one of my top choices for dinner out but this time we tried the bar.If it were ever possible, the new management has surprisingly elevated the quality even higher. The atmosphere so draws you in with the low classy lighting, the choice of gourmet bar food was superb even as late as 11pm (how often can you say that!!! but then again this is Domus) and the music was beyond my expectations; in a city were all follow the norm same old sounds, DJ Marios (had to ask who was fixing our moods to such a high state) transcended us to another space, mixing all kinds of musical sounds, making it his own. The perfect environment for drinks on the bar, you will end up off your chairs swinging to the music. I have to get back soon and try the cocktails. I expect they will be equally amazing :)This sounds too good to be true, but I am happy to say its my real response :) and glad to have found a new spot that will serve me right :)",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"My favorite place in Nicosia, i go there at least once a month.It's an old romantic building. Very unique and stylish environment, food is perfect and the staff very helpful and friendly. You can have your dinner in the restaurant at the first floor and then visit to the Lounge Bar on the ground floor . Definitely make a reservation before visiting. Prices are around 30-50 euro per person (depends if you have wine etc).",Domus Lounge Bar
40,"A luxurious decorated area, an excellent service, a culinary experience and a good wine list makes the restaurant one of the best in Nicosia. Prices medium to expensive. Big quantities on both appetizers and entrees. Excellent choice for special occations, or not.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"I went to Domus a few of times, some on office outings (holiday parties, leaving-dos, etc.), some on dates others with friends. I was never disappointed, and Domus seemed to cater perfectly for each occasion. The interior feels very cosy and discreet at the same time. Combine that with perfect service and you feel that you're the only table in the restaurant (which is never the case - always book in advance!). In the summertime the outdoor seating is a bit of a aesthetic compromise (compared to the interior), but this is Cyprus after all and seating outside to eat in an old part of the city is still very enjoyable.Impeccable dishes (and we made sure to try all of them on the office functions!) I'm sure the menu changes from time to time but the dishes I remember mostly were the succulent lamb shank (no knife needed it was so soft and creamy!) and the best beef carpaccio I have ever had. The friendly owner is always around, making sure everyone is having a good time. This to me is the sign that this restaurant means something more than just 'running a business'. It is obvious the people at Domus are passionate and happy about what they do. It might be a bit pricey, but that never left a bad taste in mouth after the great experience and good food. Absolutely worth it.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"The food is simply amazing. I have to admit that usually I‚Äôm choosing restaurants with certain type of food/cuisine from specific region and I‚Äôm hardly ever satisfied with those serving various origin dishes, but here they know what they are doing. Everything is around Mediterranean style but with a twist, the dishes are perfectly designed, mains accompanied by matching vegetables, risotto, etc.The restaurant itself has a very pleasant, eclectic design, combining the interior of an old house, some old furniture with some modern decoration and furniture.The service is excellent; you don‚Äôt know when you glasses are refilled, plates changed, etc.If I should say something bad about it, it‚Äôs just the wine list that could be more impressive, it is really short, it has few of my favorites, but I would prefer to try something else. The restaurant is a bit expensive, but really worth every cent.The restaurant is upstairs; the same place downstairs is a bar, nice interior, but awfully full on weekends and by awfully I mean, difficult to find a standing place.",Domus Lounge Bar
50,"The restaurant has an impressive interior, intimate atmosphere and should definitely be visited. The food is great and those who work there do virtuosic things in the kitchen.

The food was certainly not bad, however since we had attempted to make reservations a few previous times we expected much more. The service is good, the place is nice although some of the decor is certainly kitsch. Its worth a visit for a romantic meal for couples.",Domus Lounge Bar

Well mannered personel, a wide selection of wines, cultery dishes that meet every expectation. Menu can be considered as overpriced, yet it deserves every single penny.",Domus Lounge Bar
30,"The restaurant is nicely decorated and is quite dark, making it an ideal location for a romantic dinner. Music is also very nice: lounge type with jazz covers of french songs and other international pieces.We started with two different risottos as a starter. The portions were really big (most high end restaurants would serve that as a full course). The beetroot risotto was really interesting, mushroom risotto was ok (a little heavy on the salt).Main course was ""Capuccino Stroganoff"". We didnt like it for several reasons: it felt too heavy overall, meat was not well cooked (a little overcooked and chewy) and did not get the aromas of the sauce, the risotto side was messed up in the meats sauce (I dont think risotto is a good side for a saucy dish). The other side, asparagus, was cooked perfectly and was my favorite part of the dish!There was a nice wine selection (not stellar but better than most Cyprus restaurants).Service was good. Small hiccups here and there but nothing important.We paid 135 EUR for two starters, two mains an expensive bottle of wine (45 EUR).I think the overall experience was nice but the main dish was too average to earn a good mark. I could've easily cooked a better Stroganoff at home.I would've given it 4 stars if it was not for that dish. I think the right mark would be 3.5/5 with a rating of ""good"" but tripadvisor doesnt let me do this. Although my rating says ""average"" please read it as ""good"" (but not very good).",Domus Lounge Bar

The building is a about 100 years old with very good decor and relaxed atmosphere where you can have a nice romantic dinner. The food is great. Expect to pay around ‚Ç¨25 for each main plate.The bar downstais is also wonderful to enjoy a glass of wine of a drink.,Domus Lounge Bar

Indeed we were pleased that at an old house in the old town we found an amazing restaurant with excellent atmosphere, service, and a sophisticated menu with a variety of delicacies.

30,"Domus restaurant is restaurant that has all the perspectives to become a superb 5 star restaurant. At a first glance you see the modern design (Kartell or similar design chairs and tables) , the luxury on the tables (Riedel Crystal glasses and cutlery) and nice location.So the first impression is nice.But when it comes to the service the things are getting really bad, especially for a restaurant of this class and of course those prices.Actually there is a very big delay in all phases of a dining night. We were waiting to be brought the menus, we were waiting for the wine, we were waiting a lot for the starter. But what it was very annoying was the time elapsed between starter and main course. It was near 45! minutes. As you undestand this is unacceptable for such a restaurant. And this happened not only to us but as far a i could understand to all tables. Also we were waiting to pay and we were seeking for a waiter for more that 10 minutes! to give the credit card/What i liked in this restaurant is the wine service. We have ordered a Merlot wine and probably for first time in Cyprus it was brought in the right temperature (15- 16 Celsius) and they kept it like this in an ice container. In most cases in Cyprus Restaurants, red wine is served directly from their storage places and wine temperature is near 25 Celsius! Also the food is really good, fresh and well cooked.Concerning prices, these are certainly high, but at the same level of all rest restaurant of this class in Nicosia. The wine again, is about 4 times more expensive than you buy it in a wine house! As i wrote again i believe that a normal price is 2.5 times more expensive.Another bad thing in this restaurant is the fact that tables in summer are installed outside on the pavement. Of course people that are walking are obliged to walk in the road since pavement is full of tables. But concerning people that are dining this is a bad environment. For example our table was behind a big chipboard of a construction company that was renovating the building next to Domus....I really expected that this restaurant was a step above the rest so called ""gourmet"" Nicosia restaurant but i was disappointed .",Domus Lounge Bar
