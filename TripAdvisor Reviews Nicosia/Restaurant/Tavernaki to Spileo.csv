40,"We were a party of five and ordered the large meze so we could also try the snails. There was a lot of food leftover for us to take home. The small meze would have been fine. Food was tasty, service good even though it was a Friday night and packed. We paid about EUR20 per person with drinks (water and beer). Only negative thing is that it is on a busy central road, so if you are with kids take care.",Tavernaki to Spileo
30,"This is my second time visiting this restaurant. It is a very casual place and the food is not bad. We sat and the waiter came to get our order. We asked for the menus, and he did not seem pleased. Beyond the fact that the waiter was not the most polite, we had to wait about 45 min for the food to arrive. Only tahini came, and a water bottle. And after waiting for 20 min we asked for some pita bread. Food was not bad, even if one of the pork chops was a bit over cooked. But the service was painfully slow, despite there being quite a few waiters. Don‚Äôt think I will drive across town again for this.",Tavernaki to Spileo

30,"We had the ‚Äúbig‚Äù meze and we were all surprised when the waiter mentioned that what was brought on the table was the last dish of the night! Very limited variety and quantity comparing to other traditional taverns around Cyprus. Nothing special, rather expensive, I couldn‚Äôt understand the reason why this place was busy.",Tavernaki to Spileo
40,"Tasty traditional Cypriot dishes, nice outdoor sitting area and efficient service. You need to make a reservation at this place as it is very popular.",Tavernaki to Spileo
50,"To avoid disappointment you ""must"" book a table in advance. Why? Because this restaurant is super popular! And why wouldn't it be? The food is excellent, the service spot on! The prices hugely reasonable. Really I hesitated sharing this great restaurant with you all my friends, simply because I too don't want to be disappointed and not be able to get a table. Really this is by far one of the best Tavernaki in Cyprus! Yes honestly you will love it. We go there often and each visit delights us. So next time you're in the area make sure you visit, but don't forget book first!",Tavernaki to Spileo
40,"Food was really good and tasty. The quantity of the food was plentiful, but the variety of the dishes included in the meze was lacking. Service was good.",Tavernaki to Spileo

50,"It was recommended to me by a friend and I visited this place twice recently ;The anmbience is nothing but it is always full with local people and reservation 4-4 days in advance is required .The price is decent compare to other tavern but the Cyprus meze is so plentiful and rich -so if you 4 order 3 meze and you will have extra food for your pets in the end.The food tastes great and the souvlaki excellent . Service great ,quick and friendly .Bravo!",Tavernaki to Spileo
40,"Went to celebrate an event with some friends. We were a big group and had meze. We enjoyed the food a lot; decent selection, not a lot, and well cooked. The house wine is OK, nothing special. There was live music too, but it was not to my taste. Danced a bit but I think the live music can become more upbit to make people dance and have more fun (it was kind of boring).",Tavernaki to Spileo
50,"The best ""ofto"" I have ever had. Delicious pieces of meat (I think it's goat) and potatoes together cooked slowly in the furnice. Tender, juicy and flavorful. We also ordered ""pagidakia"" (lamb ribs cooked in the charcoals) and they tasted really good. The ""gaktompoureko"" at the end is delicious. Don't leave without tasting it. The service is professional but friendly and the atmosphere is cosy.",Tavernaki to Spileo

50,There is nothing that is not worth tasting at Spilaio. Everything are very well prepared and DELICIOUS!,Tavernaki to Spileo
40,"We visited on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy. However, we were served immediately and quickly always with a smile. We ordered mezedes... Do not order mezedes for the amount of people in your group!!!! There's is a lot of food and chances are that you will not eat everything. I loved the snails although they could have been brought earlier rather than being the last plate. Overall, very good restaurant and we will be visiting again very soon!!!",Tavernaki to Spileo
50,We visited Spilaio last night with my family to eat souvlaki. The service was 5 star and the food was amazing! Very friendly environment with good prices!,Tavernaki to Spileo
50,"We visit this small tavern last week and we were so pleased! The tavern is clean and tidy and the menu is traditional cypriot. Prices are average but portions are big! We had full meze (grilled meat meze + catsarole cooked food) for ‚Ç¨16 per person. Just meat meze was ‚Ç¨14. We took just 4 ""portions"" and was more than enough for 5 adults and 2 children. Food was nicly cooked and tasty and service was friendly and very fast. Nice surprise was the fresh fried potatos and the delicius kleftiko (goat/lamb slow cooked meat) and the amazing desert that was complimentary. With a lot of drinks we paid about ‚Ç¨90. We 'll visit this tavern again for sure!",Tavernaki to Spileo
40,A nice tavern on the main road in Deftera going toward Chrysospyliotissa church. With lots of meze dishes and mouth watering grilled meats. If you want traditional baked lamb (ofto kleftiko) you need to make a reservation. Average prices for meze.,Tavernaki to Spileo
50,"We went there on a Tuesday night and even though the place was very busy the service was fast, efficient and helpful. We had the grilled meze. They served us good sized portions and the food was well cooked and very tasty. At the end of the meal they served us complimentary galaktopoureko, a traditional cypriot desert, which was very fresh and delicious.",Tavernaki to Spileo
50,"Exceptionally good food. Meze is superb. Portions are big and will satisfy. Prices reasonable. Busy place, would recommend visit in the evenings when no music.",Tavernaki to Spileo
40,"We went on a Saturday evening, as there would be live music. The place was packed, but still service was excellent. The beef burger (we added it to our meze) was a pleasant surprise! Singers' voices are great, as well as their music. Prices are reasonable.",Tavernaki to Spileo
40,"We usually visit this tavern on fridays, as there is a lovely band with great voices. A cosy place where food including the dessert is freshly cooked and tasty (we always take the meze) and service is impeccable. We usualy stay until the end, when everyone is having a great time, including the staff!",Tavernaki to Spileo
30,"First time visit. Clean and tidy restaurant. Most of the dishes are cooked on traditional charcoal grill. We ask for some traditional dishes but unfortunately was finished, stuffed zucchini flowers, zalatina, wild mushrooms..... kebab was very tasty and tender, lamb chops over cooked, freshly cut salad, disappointed from the stew snails. Services was very quick and friendly, price is value of the money. Fresh potatoes chips was excellent.",Tavernaki to Spileo
40,"Located at Deftera village, about half hour from Nicosia. Is ideal for residents of villages in the area. We had the grill-Meze that is salad, tahini, pitta-bread, kebab chicken & pork, sieftalies, greek-sausages, halloumi , lountza, spare-ribs, mushrooms and fried-potatos. We were a big company of relatives and with our drinks (beers, refreshments and water) and the dessert a delicious Galaktoboureko we paid 20 euros per person.Food was very good, service has to be better, was crowded and noisy(although was Monday night) so I think is good for families.",Tavernaki to Spileo
50,"Their meze is one of the best we had!! Excellent quality, taste and price! (14 for the grill meze, 16 for the big meze!) Their souvlaki chicken and pork was delicious!! Their lountza and sheftalia also! They also serve one huge pork chop 600gr for 9,50!! Their place is very nice also! At the end they treated us with big pieces of galaktopoureko! Surely recommended! (because the food was so nice we didnt take any photos, we just ate it immediately!!)",Tavernaki to Spileo
50,"We 've been here before and each time the food is excellent. They change some dishes depending on the season. They serve food on the grill (charcoal) and also some magirefta (cooked food in casserole). Each time we have the meze, either the full one with the magirefta or the standard which is only grilled dishes.The salad is freshly cut and refreshing, and all the meats are cooked perfectly. The environment is good for families, even if they have infants, they have high chairs and they offer small plates for the small ones.It is also appropriate for celebrating an event, such as birthday, since they can join tables for 12 maybe more people. They offer take away of grilled dishes and you can order a dish/portion for each person if you do not want the meze.I would say that they offer Cyprus traditional dishes and not Greek.",Tavernaki to Spileo
