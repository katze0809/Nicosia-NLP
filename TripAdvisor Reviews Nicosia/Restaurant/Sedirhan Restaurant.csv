30,"The restaurant is set in a lovely courtyard and on a fine day it is a lovely setting to take a lunch. However, the food does not appeal to all tastes. Turkish Cypriot food is a bit like Marmite - you either like or you don't. I do and really enjoyed the stuffed grape leaves. I shared the dish with my wife and she did not like them. She did order other items which she, sort of, enjoyed.",Sedirhan Restaurant
10,"Bad food,I mean bad! A spot to just have beer and fries. Its a very turistic spot. Its worth a visit to hang out a bit but shouldnt be the place to have lunch!",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"The food was amazing and the location pretty good as well... I would recommend to be more kind with the costumers, like almost in every place in the island (both sides)!",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"The location of Sedirhan is truly evocative, in a lovely courtyard of an ancient building, but the food is mixed. The mixed grill of souvlaki, kofte, and sausage was very tasty, but the grilled lamb chops were overdone and not very meaty. The Efes beer was cold and refreshing and you can pay in Turkish Lira, Euros, or USD. May be worth a stop just for the setting",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Restaurant is set in an amazing location which is a bit of a tourist trap so can get busy. Food is good and reasonably priced, wouldn’t hurt the staff to smile and be more friendly to the customers, they after all very much needed!! Defiantly worth a trip if you venture this side of the border.",Sedirhan Restaurant
20,"This restaurant occupies one of the most beautiful spots in Lefkoşa (the northern part of the divided city of the former Nicosia which is located in the Turkish Republic of Cyprus); it's within the walls of the historic Büyük Han, considered to be one of the finest buildings in Cyprus. It occupies a good portion of the internal courtyard, with tables under large shade umbrellas as well as under the colonnades of this 'Great Inn', built in 1572 as lodgings for traders and merchants. As you dine, you will be overwhelmed by the beautiful setting of the restaurant.Unfortunately, waiting staff at the restaurant seemed to be overwhelmed with the huge volumes of lunchtime diners who had the same idea as I did: a leisurely lunch in a beautiful setting. I'd visited the restaurant for morning coffee earlier in the day. I had a fine freshly-brewed coffee, with attentive and cheerful service. That prompted the decision to return for lunch. Sadly, my lunch-time experience wasn't quite as pleasant. The restaurant was really busy (a bus-load of tourists had been seated just before me). I was seated, then waited for 20 minutes for a menu to be provided, then a further 20 minutes without any attention or indication that my order was going to be taken, or the water that I had ordered to be provided. My time in Lefkoşa was precious, so I left, to seek another restaurant for lunch. And if you're in the same situation, head to Krubera Restaurant on Arasta Sokak.Yes. it's a bit of a tourist trap, and yes, it's highly likely that many of the tourist diners may not return, but attentive and expedient service wasn't there on this occasion. Perhaps the restaurant was understaffed, but I would think that this pattern of dining volume is a daily occurrence.And yes, I was disappointed. The menu is comprehensive, with some great Turkish and Cypriot items I wanted to try. So my suggestion is to go earlier that I did for lunch (I was there about 13:00), and if it looks crowded, go elsewhere .",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,I want to move to cyprus this place is one of the reasons the friendliness the kindness and the amazing quality of food prepared in house is amazing its nice to sit and just watch the world go by.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"I was here twice some years ago, the quality is always very good. The context of Buyukhan centre is very nice and impressive. Very good food and drinks. I suggest to taste the Turkish pasta and a spicy meat with the excellent Efes beer. Friendly staff and moderate prices.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"This is a typical tourist place, but it is still ok. The food is ok and also the value for money is good.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"Our group ordered everything for the middle. We ordered all the 4 different types of “börek” (fried pastry with different ingredients) and bulgur meatballs. The service before ordering was slow. We waited 15 minutes before they came to our table to take our orders. After they did, the food arrived quite fast. The böreks were delicious so was the meatball. The restaurant’s setting makes it worthwhile to wait for a bit.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Friends we were staying with took us across the Green Line to visit the old city and we lunched here. It is a fascinating building, with plenty of interesting artisanal shops and galleries to look at. The weather was a bit chilly, but we coped with sitting in the courtyard, and the food was good: Turkish names for dishes that are not dissimilar in the other community, but all pleasant and nicely-cooked. Service was pleasant without being too importunate. We didn’t go for the heavier items on a long menu, though we were tempted; and had we not been dining later we probably should have pushed the boat out a little further. Cats are endemic in Nicosia and one of them showed persistent interest, making only a tactical retreat when the staff tried, not particularly fiercely, to shoo it away. A place worth visiting.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"One of the shop owners near the land crossing recommended this restaurant and we were impressed with the service despite only one person being able to speak English! The initial waiter didn’t want to serve us once he realised we don’t speak Turkish which was quite disappointing.Some of the chicken meatball was undercooked on the inside. However, the mixed platter & Adana kebab was good overall.The restaurant is set in a beautiful courtyard and it was buzzing. Can’t imagine what it would be like in the summertime.Despite the small negative aspects, the food was good overall and worth a visit if you ever cross the land border in Nicosia!",Sedirhan Restaurant
10,"Eaten there quite a few times, this was the worst ever, meatballs over cooked on outside not cooked on inside (even the cats wouldn’t eat them ) chips looked sad limp and very oily, ended up eating yogurt dip salad and bread. HaD to pick up own menu, totally ignored by waiter, wish we had walked out.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Love kleftiko! Delicious! Sea bream is very good, too! And the restaurant is located in the beautiful Büyük Han, built by the Ottomans in 1572. It’s wonderful to sit here and have a meal.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,We have visited twice for lunch now And thoroughly enjoyed both visits. Set in an enviable location you are welcomed straight away by the attentive staff. The menu offers a great selection of food where everyone in the party (5yrs- 80 years old) was able to find something they enjoyed. The friendly staff were great with the kids and adults alike and offered a great level of service that wasn’t intrusive.Highly recommended.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"We had lunch here and really enjoyed it. In general the meat on the Turkish side is tastier than the Greek side. The salads were great and the stuffed grape leaves and kebabs were just excellent. The setting is beautiful in the midst of a 16th century Chan. Oh yeah, the beer was ice cold, which is what you really really want on a hot day.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Set in the restored Buyuk Han this bustling restaurant has an envious location that alone makes it worth stopping here for lunch or a drink. The restaurant itself is set in a quarter of the complex and can get quite busy at times, however the food is good quality and service is friendly and English-speaking.Pricing is on the low end for Cyprus but around average for northern Nicosia, they accept Turkish lira, euro and dollars.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"On a very hot afternoon we were in need of refreshment and as we were looking at the shops in Buyuk Han, we stopped here for some very welcome Efes beers. Situated in this lovely area of old Nicosia the staff were very welcoming and the service very prompt. We didn't eat but the food appearing at tables nearby looked nice. Its a beautiful location to look at the building and people watch in the shade.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"In the centre of north Nicosia where everything is priced high in euros you can find this marvelous place. Local food in local prices. Portions are big, Andreas quality is good. I really recommend this place. For the dinner for two with beers and deserts we payed a little over 100TL.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"We stopped just for snacks and drinks. Prices are really low, equality is good (we just had Ayran and Burek) and service is ok. The architecture is beautiful and is really worth a visit.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,Touristic restaurant with big quantity and cheap prices but quality in the average. The location is very nice and when busy maybe bit slow,Sedirhan Restaurant
20,"Maybe the staff is so fed up with all the busloads of tourists during lunchtime that they are glad to close at 19.30h. Grumpy waiters and standard, tired meals. Of course one should visit the Karavanseray, but just for a drink.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,Pastries and Seftali Kebab was perfect. Service and communication of waiter Huseyin was a perfect example of Turkish hospitality and warmth. Turkish side is a very high potantial for tourism although there are pushed to be isolated from the world unfairly.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"This is within the Great Inn colonnaded courtyard and is very picturesque. The tables fill and empty very quickly and it can be hard to get a seat at peak times. However, they do add tables when things get busy and the service is pretty good. The food is reasonably priced and goes well with a cool glass of Efes. There are interesting shops and boutiques on the first floor of the colonnades.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"This restaurant is in the great inn in the northern occupied part of Nicosia. Now that it’s easy to cross the border from Ledra street, it’s worth going. The food is good , the setting even better. Try lamp seftalia and Adana kebab. Prices are reasonable.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,Within the Great Inn and get the right tables the location is excellent to watch everyone . The surrounding are very old and probably cant beat it as a location for a meal. Rather ended here as all the tables were full and very little serving going on. Waited for 10 minutes and then saved by our guide who knew the owners and went and got us two beers. Similar wait to pay. To be fair what food that came out looked very good. If in Nicosia call in here to walk around the shops and have a drink. Who knows there might be a few more working in the restaurant.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,Had an excellent Firin Kebab but for the uninitiated this is not a kebab as we know it but Tandour on the bone cooked/baked beautifully in an Ottoman style oven.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,Very traditional and picturesque tavern inside buyuk han serving traditional Cyprus and Cyprus Turkish meals. Outside seating and low prices,Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"Located close to the border crossing, this restaurant serves several favorites such as stuffed chicken, clay pot stews and salads. Nothing special, but worth a stop if you're nearby and want a fairly cheap meal.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,Stopped here for lunch while crossing as a foot passenger into the Turkish part of Cyprus and we were not disappointed. Service was great in a very beautiful location. Food was exceptional!,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Taken here by our guide for a lunch stop. The have lot to choose from but only wanted something light. So my friend and l decided to share. We picked out a potato wrap and some large pastries filled with meat. The potato wrap was filled with chips, tomato and cheese, nice, didn't expect that, the pastries about 10 arrived as one portion, help. It was all very tasty and we enjoyed it. Service was good. No toilet but you can use the ones outside in the square. A nice place to while away your time. Bills come in 3 currency's, so easy to pay. Would go back and recommendd.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Located in Buyuk Han, it's a good place to watch the world go by. Greek cuisine, the food was on par with most restaurants of this type. It's the location that makes it worth a visit. Staff are friendly and helpful.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"The food was good, however they need better serving staff. The female Russian lady was excellent and she tried her best to accomodate us but the rudeness and the neglect of the male waiter was unforgivable. We had to personally go to the counter many times to give orders or add more food or beverages, even that was somehow okay but then when we tell him we were ready to give orders his reply was ""go to your table and wait""... No please, no smile just an order. If they treat a paying customer like that I doubt how they will strive in a competitive business.",Sedirhan Restaurant
10,"Very disappointed. Use to love this place but it's changed. Slow and rude service with a comment in Turkish ""they only ordered water"" which we understood and replied that we wanted food which took over 30 mins to come. Then the sweet ricotta borek had 2 different coloured hairs in 2 different parcels. Put us off! We complained and they said ""we'll take it off the bill"" which they did but with no remorse or apology! Disappointing",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Great location to stop by while visiting the north side of Nicosia. Very clean, the staff is friendly and the food tasty and enough to fill up your tanks for the rest of the day.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Tucked away from the busy streets and clothes shops inside the Buyuk Han, this a great place for a coffee, drinks and food and appeared to be the most popular with visitors when we were there which was a good sign. Prices were very reasonable and service was prompt - even though this is Northern Cyprus, the people are still just as friendly and brilliant with children as those in the South so nothing to worry about - payment is accepted in Euros and Lira. The local coffee was good and they also served beer in giant tubes for you to pour your own at your table - I imagine if you stayed on into an evening, the night has got potential to turn very messy here! The addition of fans makes this a great place to escape the heat of the day and enjoy good food and drink.",Sedirhan Restaurant
10,"We were kept waiting for over 30 minutes at a dirty table . When the food eventually came we found hairs in two boreks and decided not to finish our meals . Noticed that on a nearby table they had also decided not to finish their chicken , burned to charcoal .Not too sure about their hygiene. Will definitely give it a misss on our next Nicosia visit. seems to cater for tourits rathet than repeat clientele.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"The Sedirhan Restaurant is located within the 16th century caravanserai, known as the 'Buyuk Han' in the Turkish area of Nicosia - or Lefkosia as it is called in North Cyprus. It's an interesting and historic location, and a good place to visit and relax. The restaurant is well situated, and serves quite a variety of local and European foods at very reasonable prices. Alcoholic and soft drinks are served, as well as tea and coffee. Service is quick and efficient, and the food was good. We had a mixture of hot food and local salads. We only had lunch there, quite nice to get out of the sun into the cool Buyuk Han, and I understand the restaurant is open from early morning until quite late.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"We had a lovely lunch here in the Buyuk Ham, which took us away from the noise and bussle of the rest of the city. The restaurant is most outdoors (covered), service is very friendly considering how busy they were and the food surprisingly lovely. We enjoyed the local dishes, there was even a woman making ravioli and it was mesmerizing to watch her. Highly recommend this spot. If you are a cat lover order another meat dish, you will have some hungry felines at your feet.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Stopped for lunch while crossing over from the Republic and we have been recommended this restaurant. Nice lunch , good service and reasonably priced. Worth a visit as the setting is very nice .",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,Good for snack the sweet ricotta pies come as a huge portion so share amongst at least 6 of you!! Nice coffee frappe. I would recommend coffee and watch the people in this fantastic space in the old buildings,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Set lunch here was included in our “Tourplus”/ Cyprus Paradise day trip to Nicosia. Very pleasantly surprised!Lamb, chicken, salad, rice, tzatziki and flat bread followed by sweet cheese pastry.Drinks were not included but prices were very reasonable.Situated within the Buyuk Han, it’s a welcome retreat from the busy streets. There are toilet facilities within the courtyard but as mentioned in another review there is a fee. There are other facilities outwith the courtyard that are free.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"During our visit to Buyuk Han, the largest caravansarai on the island of Cyprus we stumbled upon the Sedirhan Restaurant tucked away in one corner of this Impressive building. Our timing was just right, having arrived just before lunchtime there were plenty of tables to choose from. We only wanted a light snack so I settled for the minced meat in vine leaves and my partner enjoyed a plate of meat pastries. We were served by very friendly and efficient staff.The nearest toilets are within the Buyuk Han, however there is an entry fee to use them.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,I stopped for a meal inside at Sedirhan for some Turkish dolmas (meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves) and a pint of Turkish beer Efes on draft which tasted great compared to the Cypriot Keo beer. The dolmas were just average. But great surroundings!,Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"Located within the courtyard of Buyuk Han is this delightful cafe. After the colourful bustle of the main streets is was lovely to sit and admire the ancient architecture. The staff were welcoming and friendly, the seats comfortable and the menu varied. I had the lamb souvlaki which was three skewers of tender lamb accompanied by home made chips, rice, salad and tatziki. The complimentary ricotta pastries that ended the meal were lovely. I had a Nescafe frappe, my dining companions enjoyed a glass of Efes.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"Visited Buyuk Han at lunchtime and decided to linger over lunch and soak up the surroundings. Service was prompt and staff helpful. The food was really good - a Cypriot chip butty for me (potato wrap) and the traditional Cypriot kebab for my companion- lamb on the bone, a baked potato, salad bowl, toasted bread and flat bread and a good helping of sour cream. Great value for money. We also had complementary apple and ricotta pies. Excellent choice for lunch.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"I work nearby and go once in a while for lunch. I like the home made pasta (pirohu or manti, depends on the filling). It is indeed home made as at times the cook will be outside rolling the dough and preparing the local ravioli. Salads and meats are also a good choice. Friendly service as they receive lots of buses with tourists. So at times it is quite full.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,Couldn't resist stopping to eat the restaurant was busy but still had plenty of free tables. Great friendly service and wonderful plate of food all reasonable priced. Enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere sitting in the sunshine. Menu had something for everyone also a menu of the day.Visit you won't come away hungry!,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"We stopped for coffee here quite early in the morning which we had with a traditional cake, something like baclava. Service is fine, although the young lady seemed tired (of tourists perhaps?). The best part of the place is the setting in the Gamblers Inn, it's a nice place to stroll around and see all the local crafts people in operation.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"I won't describe the place, as others have done that perfectly well.What I will recommend is the dish of the day which, when we were there, was kleftiko - slow-cooked lamb, one of my favourite dishes of all time. That came with a very generous and not at all boring side salad, an enormous baked potato, rice and, if that wasn't enough carbs, two types of bread. This was then followed by bourekia (sorry, don't know the name in Turkish) stuffed with Anari - white cheese, like ricotta.It was all really tasty. The kleftiko could have taken some more time in the oven but that's me being fussy.Go early, because we got the last menus of the day and big groups dine here so if they all choose the special, you have no chance.And avoid paying an enormous amount for a big bottle of sparkling water and just get the local water instead. But all in all, great value for money and dining in very pleasant surroundings.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"After wandering around the sights of the Turkish side of Nicosia we had lunch here. A little touristy, but only to be expected given its location, but we had a good meal with portions so large that we couldn't finish them! Our waiter was multilingual and I hear him chatting fluently in German and French, plus in English to us. Much cheaper than food in the Greek restaurants across the border.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"Meandering along in the Turkish side of old Nicosia, I stumbled into a rather majestic, squared-shape, two-storied, stone building from the 16th century: the “Buyuk Han” (the Great Inn). As I turns out, this building, with its 68 rooms surrounding a nicely-sized inner courtyard, has been converted into an art center, with various galleries and workshops, restaurants, and souvenir stores. The Sedirhan is one of these restaurants. I ended up having lunch here. The food and service was what one would expect from a place packed with tourists. Compensating for that, the setting was absolutely beautiful.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,A really interesting setting within a Kervansaray. Full of tourists and few locals but still exceptional.A very interesting and comprehensive menü with some unusual dishes.I was lost for choice and would have to go back many times to complete and taste my likes and preferences.Good cold beer is the order of the day.,Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"The first time you go from the surrounding, chaotic little streets through the gateways into the Buyuk Han is quite a startling experience. You'd never imagine this oasis of tranquility in the heart of the bustling city. The Sedirhan Restaurant in situated in a corner of a beautiful, colonnaded, 16th century caravansarai. It's pleasant to sit out and eat throughout most of the year. The service is friendly and attentive but it can be just a little slow when it's busy. Still, why the rush ? Sit back, have an ice cold Efes and soak in the beautiful surroundings. The food is great; the Manti and fried meat pies and baked spinach pies are amazing and the prices are very reasonable indeed. You're not going to get a nasty shock when the bill comes. This has to be the most beautiful location for a restaurant in Nicosia. That, together with great food and good prices makes it a real find.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,The food here is so fresh and good the service is terrible. The staff barely speak English so if you want any variations they won't be able to accomodate you. It's also very slow service. Food I would recommend the katimeri. It's amazing.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"We stumbled upon Sedirhan by accident on the way to cafe we have eaten at on previous trips. This was closed and thank god it was as back to Sedirhan we went and we were all very impressed. As a group of 6 we knew we needed a larger table and the staff were very kind and pushed two together for us, ensuring we still sat in the shade. The staff were very attentive, coming over after about 10 minutes to take our order and again to check everything was okay with our meals. 5 out of the 6 ordered kebabs in various forms which came with salad, chips and rice. The star of the show however was the grilled sea bream my mum had, she couldn't stop raving about it and a sneaky forkful confirmed why - delicious! At the end of our meal one of the servers came over and gave us a complimentary dessert to share. Not sure what it was we all tucked in to the pastry with sweet filling! Lovely cafe and fab service! Would return!",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Visited the restaurant yesternight along with friend. The place is simply amazing, the construction of the entire building seems like some historical place. Along with the restaurant, there are few shops in the compound as well.The food is great, with good variety of food. The quantity of food is quite much so be mindful before ordering. The rate is quite reasonable, approximate 10 euro is good enough for a nice food along with drink. The serving time is quite reasonable. Free wifi of course with good signal strength. We really enjoyed our time at this restaurant. Highly recommended from my side.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Make sure to try the bidda(pitta bread), kofte, hellim and badadez(potato) dish. Also, have some ayran with that!",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"located in the Buyuk Han , this restaurant offers traditional turkish cypriot food , the taste is great, the service is fine and the historical location offers a nice atmosphere ...",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,First of all its the only restaurant in Buyuk Han. If you want to try the homemade lemonade this is the right place. You can watch how they make borek. Its a place highly recommended but make a reservation in advance otherwise it may be full and you have to wait before seated.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"The Medieval 'Great Inn' is an excellent place to sit and relax while admiring the structure of the historic building, browsing the little shops and people watching. The Sedir Inn is one of two cafes, the other being more of a traditional coffee house. The Sedir offers the usual selection of chicken and meat dishes with one or two fish and vegetarian options - all standard cafe fare - but good value and very reasonable and tasty.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,This is a nice stop in the Turkish part of the city. The food is nice and the prices are not high at all. I would recommand this restaurant!,Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"Well, it is really strange but the only place where you can find good restaurants in Northern Cyprus is Girne. It is even more strange as the Turks are famous for their fantastic food but all the Lefkosa restaurants are very average. The only difference with Sedirhan is a location that is good: inside an old castle that creates a nice atmosphere.I can't say the food was bad: it was just very average. From my point of view it is not a restaurant - it is what the Turks call ""locanta"" that is one level below a restaurant. Anyway, if you are hungry and you are in Turkish Lefkosa Sedirhan could be the best option. The menu is a regular one for any Turkish meat restaurant: kebabs, chicken, meatballs served with rice, potatoes, salat and some local salads. As all these dishes are very heavy that is not good in a hot summer day, I would recommend the local ravioli called Manti. Much lighter and pretty exclusive.The pricing is very reasonable: we have paid TL 75 or Euro 25 for 2 main dishes, 3 glasses of ayran and a glass of a white house wine.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"Being in the Buyuk Han monument the location of this place is excellent, and their food is good. Just sit and imagine being their in the times of the old caravanserai.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"When you need to sit and cool down after the heat of the day this is the place to go. We had lunch and the food was very good. Lots of homemade Borek and you can sit and watch a Turkish lady make it while you wait. Service wasn't great, we would have liked another drink with our meal but we were never asked and also took a while for our plates to be cleared. Lovely spot, good food and competitive prices.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"I had walked past this place for most of my life and actually never really felt it was worth popping in because of its old decrepid looks externally, however I plucked up the courage and wow! This place which was built by the Ottomans and is very few places in Cyprus that has a listed status has recetly been restored. But what tops it all is the Ottoman style resturant with a modern twist - serving the most fantastic dishes all freshly cooked whilst you wait - Sedirhan is my top 3 places to eat! You really have to try the Sac - Katmeri!!!!",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,Situated inside the Buyuk Khan in the old city this restaurant is always busy. Often a good place to avoid the sun and sit in the shade. Varied menu of snacks and mains.Fast efficient service.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,The staff were so friendly and efficient and the food was tasty with large portions. I'd recommend for lunch looking out over the area as it has so much character.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,We crossed over from Cyprus for lunch on Green Monday (first day of Lent) as the local shops were all closed.We'd wanted to see the Buyuk Han and were aware that Sedirhan was nestled inside the walls of this impressive caravanserai.Great welcome and very good service with a good menu and drinks list. Our first choice was gone so we both opted for a mixed kebab dish. The food was tasty and plentiful and the company that day was exotic.,Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"We always visit this place. Just to sit in the Buyuk han is a delight. if you are lucky the old girls will be out rolling their borek pastry (filo if you are greek). It is great just watching them with their thin rolling pins, flipping the borek over. Taste the various dishes. I must confess my favorite is potatoes in a borek wrap - OK a chip butty but lovely. A must visit if you are there.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"Good local food served in a lovely setting. The service is efficient and thoughtful (on our first visit they rushed to help us move table when the rain started). There is enough on the menu to keep younger eaters happy. There are some non-meat options but not loads. However, the Efes is very well chilled and tastes even better there than other places for some reason",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"I don't just go to Sedirhan for a big meal or take visitors for a treat. It's a good lunchtime snack place too. Instead of burgers or fast food, come here and eat börek and have a drink. The desserts are good too.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,its very tasty place and its very nice sample for understanding Turkish taste. you have a change to drink very nice Turkish coffe.,Sedirhan Restaurant
30,"The biggest asset of the Sedirhan is the location. Situated inside the Buyuk Han, it is rather atmospheric. But the food is nothing special. Precooked frozen fries, precooked rice and some poor excuse of a salad on the side. The tavuk shish was very tender, though. The service was OK.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"We were visiting the Turkish side and stopped in at the shops at the Han, then had lunch at Serdihan. The meal was served quickly and was delicious. The portion were good and priced reasonably. I would go back!",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"My friend and I popped over into Turkish Nicosia for a few hours, and found that this restaurant looked one of the nicest places to eat. The menu was reasonably priced, and when converted into Euros it was perfectly acceptable.The portions are large, but having ordered the Kiyma Boregi (meat pie), I do think I should have gone for one of the kebabs which came with salad and fries. The beer was plentiful and we had a pitcher of Efes, which is the standard on the Turkish side, and the surroundings in the courtyard were also nice and relaxed.One interesting event after the meal was that a very large insect,maybe around the size of a hornet which was crimson with yellow stripes, took a liking to my friend's chicken, and flew off with a piece the size of my little fingernail. Impressive work for such a small animal!",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,Set in the delightful courtyard of the Turkish Buyuk Han the cafe is a pleasant place to stop for lunch washed down with draft Efes beer. Prices are quite low given the setting and the food more than satisfactory.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Huge portions in a nice atmosphere. Sitting between old walls, enjoying the summer and Turkish hospitality. The salad has a little bit too much cabbage.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"I visited Sedirhan for lunch after crossing into Northern Cyprus whilst in Nicosia. This was the best food I had during my stay in Cyprus. Excellent service, great value, and an amazing location. Don't hesitate to go if you get the chance.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Sedrihan is the cafe inside the 15 century ottoman Caravanserai Büyuk Han ""great inn"" in Turkish northern Nicosia. To day a restored craft and artisan collective, a fantastic building, Sedirhan is a simple Turkish cafe in the courtyard a great place take in the surroundings and soak up the atmosphere.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"We came across Buyukhan by accidetn and were very happy to spend a couple of hours in the quaint courtyard being looked after by the Sedirhan Cafe. Great service by the waitors who recommended good food, were attentative to our refreshments and made us smile. Go find this hidden gem and escape for a while.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Taken by friends to have lunch in this centuries old travellers inn. The Sedirhan has traditional Turkish dishes. We ate stuffed wheat rolls, wraps, omelettes and chicken kebab. Generous portions served by a waiter who kept us amused with his pleasantries and jokes.Well worth a visit.POINT TO NOTE: they do not have their own toilet but you can use the clean toilets open to the public within the inn. To avoid having to pay ask for a token at the cafe bar.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Set in a wonderful old courtyard with loads of atmosphere it could be fabulous, unfortunately the haphazard service and average food let it down, not as bad as the usual typical tourist trap, but only due to the setting. I had a mixed grill which while not bad was not memorable, the best thing on my plate was the rice. It's cheap which is why I gave it 4*s.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"After expensive Greek part of Cyprus this restaurant was like a paradise with big dishes and small fee. Amazing tortillas with cheese!!! Good, but not the best dolma, and great chicken at grilled meat mix. I recommend this place.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"one of the best places that you can experience the local pastry & desserts. I never tried their main meals as i always visit this place for their freshly prepared pastries ( borek!) Make sure you spare a room for ""katmer"" !",Sedirhan Restaurant

50,"We ate lunch at this lovely cafe and enjoyed it so much we returned to enjoy dinner with some friends. The food is fabulous, servings generous and service excellent. The setting is lovely - the cafe is in a courtyard a d is surrounded by buildings with craft stalls. It is only a few minutes walk north of the border checkpoint in Nicosia.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Sedirhan Cafe is located inside the Buyuk Han, a place that is an architecturally beauty. The prices at this restaurant are very good (they make a good conversion YTL - EUR), the menu is not very diversified, the food was not the best (I've tried the Cypriot traditional meatballs), but the service was extraordinary.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"A Sunday afternoon visit. Teens, oldies and us. The grandmother had chicken steak after failing to finish the guvec last time. Teens had Cyprus kofte. Men had guvec. I had spinach borek and salad. Everything was perfect as usual. The most useful place to take guests.",Sedirhan Restaurant
20,"he would do well to run a coffee shop, and not a restaurant, where the toilet, jut by the way, is kind of 100 m around the building... this tells it all, do not know where the real cooking happens - but the food compared to the non-occupied zone, was not up to our expectations.The Buyukhan however, is great and to stop there and take a coffee or drink or a soda is a very good suggestion.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"In the old part of Lefcosa/Nicosia in North Cyprus, close to the border with the Republic of Cyprus you will find Büyük Han which is an old Caravanserai or a Travellers Inn. In one of the inside square's corners, Sedirhan Café and Restaurant is located. It is a busy place popular by visiting tourists. The large group I was part of had booked tables on beforehand. When we came in the staff immediately showed us to our tables and short after drinks were ordered and served, our prebooked warm lunch began to appear on the tables. The waiting time was much shorter than expected. We were impressed by the quick and nice service, and the humorous comments left by the waiters at our tables. The food was very good and we had a first class lunch in a plain but serviceminded restaurant. A fine place to relax after hot hours walking around to see the city's sightseeing spots.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"I really enjoyed relaxing and having lunch and wine at the Sedirhan Cafe in the Buyuk Khan. The food was great, the service was really really nice and the courtyard is just a really lovely place to hang out and relax. Little shops around the sides and cafe tables in the center. Looking forward to visiting again.",Sedirhan Restaurant
30,It has nothing special but the food is good and the service too. It is located in one of the most famous Northen Nicosia attractions and a stop is worth. I recommend the almond rolls a very tastefull desert.,Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Sedirhan cafe & restaurant is located within Buyukhan, Nicosia, Northern-Cyprus.Even though it clearly is a touristic restaurant, within a touristic crowded site, food is OK, and service is friendly & kind.At Sedirhan you can relax, have a drink, or dine. Menu is based on some fresh & tasty local servings.Intersting as-well is the site's architecture and history.Very recommended.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"Went there for lunch after a few hours of intensive shopping around the North side of Nicosia. After passing the border and find a huge shopping district we loved it!,the Cafe is inside the Büyük Han and surrounded by other shops and cafes. Food was really Tasty, well prepared and good sizes portions. Beer in the 70cl glass was my favorite,specially with the August hot weather. Waiter was so nice and kid we didn't want to leave! Would love to reapeat again. Congrats.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"It 's the second time we visit this cafe-restaurant. Simple and traditional. The food was great, fresh and tasteful. The service was friendly. The scenery is amazing because you are sitting on the middle of an old monastery that now is a market with souvenirs. When you go to the occupied side for shopping or sight-seeing, in a bright sunny day this place is like an oasis to sit down and enjoy a cold local beer, in a frozen glass, or even better a fresh-made cold lemonade with fresh mint. We enjoyed also the local desserts that was offered to us from the restaurant, home made pies with unsalted cheese and cinamon. :-)",Sedirhan Restaurant
20,"This restaurant is located in the North side of Nicosia, in a cool market square kind of area. I was looking forward to trying some unique traditional Turkish food after being in the main part of Nicosia for a few days. The servers were friendly and spoke a small amount of English. They accept Turkish lira, Euros, or dollars.The menu has pictures of each dish, which SHOULD be helpful. However, even after I asked a question about a dish and pointed directly to the picture, they brought a totally different meal! They made no offer to bring me the correct dish, so I went ahead and ate what they brought. It was a very basic and plain meat skewer meal, which I could have gotten anywhere in Cyprus. The meat was a bit fatty and not flavorful at all.After the meal, I realized that they charged me for the wrong meal, which was actually more expensive! At least it was only a small price difference...but I wouldn't bother going back again.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Stopped here with the family for a quick snack (lunch), a rest and some cold drinks while exploring North Nicosia and the lovely historic Buyuk Han, (meaning ""Big Inn"").There are several choices of place to get refreshments in the courtyard of the Buyuk Han and we choose ""Sedirhan Café"" as it seemed the busiest, always a good sign in my book, and there were plenty of fans and shaded tables... Essential when it was over 40 Degrees Celsius.We had the Chicken Kebab Skewers, (at 20 Turkish Lira), homemade Lemonade and I had a large, and very cold, 'Efes Pilsner' Beer. It was all very tasty and reasonably priced and the cold beer was very welcome. Service was polite, fast and efficient, (ideal when you are keen to get back to exploring Nicosia), and the waiters were fun and friendly... The guy that bought our bill pinched my son's baseball cap as was playing about, which made us all chuckle. (See photos).I Highly Recommend the Buyuk Han (See my separate review and photos for this attraction) as well as the Sedirhan Café while you are there.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Want somewhere to soak up the atmosphere of the Buyuk Han in Lefkosa, Cyprus, then this is the place. Excellent food, very friendly staff, great comedians... Traditional food served very quickly. Reasonable priices too. It all comes down to the setting....you can't beat it.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,You'd think it was very expensive but it's not! Tge büyük han itself is a charitable trust so the rents are reasonable allowing the patron to price the menu very competitively.Today I had spinach borek (flatstone baked pastries) because I adore borek. They were perfect. My friend had meat güveç or meat cooked on a clay container which comes with a nice pilaf huge salad and 2 pieces of flat bread to dip in. My other friend fancied a salad and had feta and it was very very big fresh and tasty. Very good range of beers. Unusual things that don't come across so well. Bida patates. Written as potatoe in bread on the menu which it is but o so more exciting. It is fried chunks or wedges of potato added to a home made flat bread. Totally yummy. I think you czn have halloumi in it. In tge puddings one is katmer. I can't remember the odd english translation but its like chapatti or parathaa made sweet with honey. Nannies make it at home with the bits of left over dough after making börek. Very clean. Excellent portions. Compared to tge usual fare of North Cyprus I can't recommend it enough,Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"This restaurant is situated inside Buyuk Khan, which was built by the Ottomans in 1572, the year after they had seized Cyprus from the Venetians.It consists of several galleries , workshops,several courtyard cafes and souvenir shops.I had manti at Sedir Café, which is ravioli filled with meat, with delicious yoghurt sauce on top. Simply wonderful. I highly recommend this place!",Sedirhan Restaurant

40,"Please go this restaurant and try ""pirohu"", one of the most delicious thing i ate in Cyprus. Also, the atmosphere is very beautiful, in the historical part of the Lefkosa.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"This is the first restaurant I have visited in Nicosia. Actually I was my first visit to the town itself. My friends and I went into the Buyuk Han facilities to see whats inside the wallsas a tourist and saw this place in the corner of the square. We sat down for a beer and waited for the hunger to arise.After a few tours to this divided island and their continental parts I have found that I like their cuisine rather well. So - when looking through their menue I knew this was going to be good.For the main course, we all ordered kebab mix which is basically the varity of the kebabs on their menue. As side we ordered bread, yoghurt and croutons.The plates were covered with a well prepared and well cooked meal. The waitress offered some specialities i e homemade meatballs as an extra and ""on the house"". It tasted great.All in all. This was a very good meal for hungry and thirsty sailors.The service was ok and and waiters on allert. Price very afforadble.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"Sedirhan located inside the renovated old Buyuk Han, another great historic building of Turkish Cyprus. Sedirhan cafe serving local Turkish tastes morning and lunch time. Nicely located restaurant with acceptable taste of original Turkish cuisine.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"My niece and I visited the Buyuk Han n May 2013 and spent a few hours there, looking, shopping and lunching at the Sedirhan restaurant which was quite packed, few tourists of course but mostly locals. Food is fresh, prepared on the spot and offered a lot more choice that the usual grilled meat with mezes which is the staple food of restaurants on the cost in North Cyprus. We enjoyed delicious dolmas (stuffed wine leaves), mantis (Turkish raviolis) and lahmacun (the local pizza, minced meat and spices on thin pita bread). The 3 plates for 2 of us were so big that we requested to take -and were smilingly given- the leftovers in a doggie bag, together withe the salty and sweet boereks (meat or cheese stuffed philo pastries) we had ordered for take away. All this + 1 brandy sour, 1 glas wine, 1 coke and 2 coffees came up to TL 99 (approx. EUR 39). And the restaurant's toilets (just outside the Buyuk Han) are spotless...",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"Situated in the beautiful and historic Buyuk Han, this restaurant served excellent typically N. Cypriot food at very reasonable prices. Four of us had a main course and a drink for 69TL (about £25) sitting outside in the shade with a great view people watching across Buyuk Han - what is there to complain about?",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"Inside Buyuk Han i felt trapped in ancient times. This historic place is magnificent! On top of a good meal, an Efes beer is a must.",Sedirhan Restaurant
40,"We were seeking this place from the latest Lonely Planet's wayward (surprise, surprise) directions and had given up so decided to take a squint in the Buyuk Han caravanserai before it shut up and there in the corner was the place we had been looking for! Despite it being only twenty minutes before they closed there was no problem with ordering a meal. I found the ravioli in yoghurt was just what I needed after the difficulties of finding food free from onions in Cyprus - my stomach thanked me not only for the tastiness but also the gentleness. The ambiance is very special here and the only thing I can really fault the place with is that the guy by the till did not take himself off somewhere else when he had a sneezing fit - probably a one-off.",Sedirhan Restaurant
20,"The place is gorgeous and worth a visit, so I definitely recommend to go and have a drink under the shaded arches. But do yourself a favour and stay away from the food. I went there to try the manti (turkish ravioli served with a spicy yogurt sauce) as recommended by the Lonely Planet, but this was the worst meal I had in two weeks in Cyprus. It was lukewarm, the sauce and cheese on top completely tasteless, and the meat filling really had a suspect taste... I looked at the plates served to the big group of german tourists sitting next to us, and it looked really bland as well, typical tourist-trap fare of overcooked meat, pasta and greasy fries.Prices were ok, and service efficient.",Sedirhan Restaurant
50,"The cafe is located in a beautiful place, surrounded by flowers and history. The food was excellent, well cooked, well served and delicious. This palce is a must to be visited once yu are in Northern Lefcosia!",Sedirhan Restaurant
