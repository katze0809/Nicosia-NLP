50,"La brasserie has been my go-to place whenever I wanted a bit of home. And home I found: very French fare, flavours, looks, smells - a total joy.I did enjoy Cypriot snails, but I was raised with the French way, so no battle there. The frog's legs, the paté, the steaks, mussels etc: if you want to taste France without the flying, try Au bon plaisir, full stop.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"This is the 2nd time being there and the quality is even better than the previous time. The food was wonderful (pink soup, oysters, veal and boar).What about the service? The owner and her kids were absolutely great. Quick service and wilingful and delightful to serve you!And the music? Of course live music for that special night!Is a must for a romantic night!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Wholeheartedly recommended, good pricing for the portions served as well! We ordered the sirloin steak, the beef bourguignon, the soleil red wine, as well as the lettuce, bacon and goat’s cheese salad, plus dessert and coffee. I have nothing but great things to say, and we are planning on revisiting soon.Give it a try:)",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"After reading the reviews about this plae, i srarted reading tje bad ones , and looks like the owners really put an effort to reply, we thought lets go and try this place!I am not a big fan of anything french, but this place i will for sure visit again.It's a quiet place, that server many different food, the fact french people have a glass and a sppon and fork for everything is a bit funny, but overall ambience experience was niceThe waitor was n amazing dude who knew everything that we asked and it helps a lot to know what you are about to eat.We ordered a variety of food duck, fish, and french beef. Everything was amazing, the apetizers were really nice (althought they were a bit expensive for apetizers but very tasty, probably due to the fact that in france they lile to charge more for their products haha)wine was exceptional!portion of main dish was big(there goes my stereotype! haha)so overall i am very satisfied, congrats to the chef and the stuff!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,Take a mini torch to view the menu. Food was nice though.Music was nice. Overall we had a nice time with our friendswhich made our evening.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"OK the restaurant is located at a nice location.Service is nice, music is ok and overall the atmoshpere is nice.Regarding food:Avoid pork;Tasteless and little quantity.Side dishes could be improved.Steaks are tasty but expensive (you pay for what you get)Apperetif is expensive: 3 glasses 16.50€-come on!!!They also charge 3€/pp for live music which is fine.But they told us that there is a basket for tips (!!!).Reason?Overall I would say that for these prices there are better options on same class restaurants.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,"A business dinner in Cyprus, organized by a middle-eastern man... the choice could not be more wrong. French food is great, but not in Cyprus, and at least not in this restaurant. Most guests from my table complained about some or another aspect of their food not being really french. My mussels and fries, I had two different pots, tasted the same, too greasy (how can you make mussels greasy!?) too creamy, the french fries arrives later, separately, cold... the host is friendly, and gets most of the orders right, though a few plates, when brought out, had difficulty finding their owner. I would recommend to avoid this place, for those who know the french cuisine, and for those who want to try, don't try it here, or you will hate french food, unfairly...",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"It was an amazing experience, a cozy little French germ in Nicosia. Very friendly, romantic and french traditional environment. Food was amazing, we have tried the snails and frog legs as starters (which are a must) then we had steaks for main and we finish it of by sharing a strawberry cheesecake which was the sweet of the day. Everything was fresh and delicious. We were very lucky because last night there was live music by the French singer Tony who he actually visits Cyprus in every couple of months and make the evenings even more delightful. It was the perfect combination to accompany food and fine red wine. It wasn’t just a typical restaurant for us but it was a full on experience of a night in France (since the owners are French themselves). A must go. We are definitely going back to try more of their delicious dishes!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"lovely food, timely service, happy looking people, food cooked to perfection, steaks, like butter we go at least once a month!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Quality is consistent, there is a variety of choices, and the experience urges you to re-visit! The quiche, the camembert, the salads, the auglette or the fillet mignon, accompanied by very good wine (even if requested by the glass), combined with a relaxing environment, all make it a worthwhile experience and one will definitely want to go back again!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"To both reviewers who wrote their reviews on 26th and 27th of April 2019. Certainly you are the one who likes to get some free food/service etc. complaining all the time, otherwise you would not write the comment right after you left the restaurant. Now regarding the food. That was an amazing experience of real French food, escargots, frog legs and fried cheese were excellent. We also ordered stakes and I have to say they were one of the best on the island. We had a family party in a family running restaurant, our kids were sometimes playing games on the tablet, but not the way it is described below. We did not mentioned who was inside the restaurant as we had nice and happy time there, but after some time one of the client shouted something and run away, not even having courage to come over and say me that my kids are playing loudly. That was strange... we continued the party and had very happy time and tasty food. Would recommend this restaurant to everyone who is looking for the French food in Nicosia.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,We go to this place every time we have a celebration. They never let us down. We love their fresh mussels and steak,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Au Bon Plaisir might not seem spectacular on the outside but their dining experience definitely is. From typical French dishes like Froglegs (highly recommended!) to snails over to Mussels and various steaks cooked to perfection, their menu offers anything a gourmet desires. A good selection of award winning wines paired with the hospitable owners create a very welcoming atmosphere and will create a wonderful dining experience for you. A must visit for everyone living in Nikosia or visiting the Cyprus capital.Bon Appetit!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,"We went to the restaurant with my husband having great expectations and left with a bitter taste. We order the four-cheese quiss as a first to share. It was warmed in the microwave and as a result too oily and strange. I order the trout with almonds. It was terribly presented in a lake of a watery sauce. The sauce was actually good but the fish had not any special taste. My husband citrus mussels were better than my fish. However, the bet dish of the night were the French fries. I do not know if it was the dishes we chose but I was not happy at all.υ δεν μας άρεσε το φαγητό στο εστιατορείο",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"The only thing that reminded me of a French restaurant was the name. The place was empty but yet the waitress seemed stressed running 2-3 tables. The main dishes came out in under 10 minutes so clearly they are not made fresh. The is way too expensive for what it is, eat somewhere near Nicosia: at least there they have some good competition and the taste and prices reflect that. There is no ambiance and the place looks run down. They clearly don’t care about the customer experience as another table was being disruptive and they did nothing about it. So if you want to go there for French food, don’t - there is nothing French about the food or the experience.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"I came here on a Friday night, there were two other tables, the food was very average, my chicken with cream sauce was ok but seemed to have cheese that was not mentioned. My girlfriends beef bourguignon was the worst she ever had.The best part was there was a party with young children being externally load and playing a game in their Ipad, there was no music for some reason so all I could hear was the sound of the game, I asked the waitress to ask them to turn the game down and she said she could not do that, I’ve never been to a restaurant where it was acceptable for kids to play a game with the sound on full and that all we could hear. It ruined our meal, we asked for a check right away after that and left.They did offer us a free dessert, which we declined as we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible, but nothing off check for the unpleasant experience.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"It literally exceeded my expectations by far. I ve been at the same place for Valentines about decade ago and was utter disappointment as catering was screaming. Last night, all was prefect: decor, live music, aperitif, mussels cooked perfectly soft and cooked but what amazed me was the salmon, a generous portion sizzled to perfection with a thin layer of crispness and soft but cooked inside! I think the sauce was unnecessary that’s how perfect salmon was. And the staff was patient and top polite as if they all were members of family ..... Congratulations Gatienne!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I was looking for a good steakhouse in Nicosia, and Brasserie au bon plaisir came up in the top results, so I decided to give it a try.The restaurant is high-tech enough to take online bookings (via e-table) which was very convenient, as I was able to do the booking on a busy working day, during a meeting :)The restaurant's atmosphere is very pleasant, on the specific night there was a special live music event, which was made the whole French dining experience more authentic.All staff we interacted with, were very helpful and friendly.And finally, the main attraction of the evening, the food! It was amazing. Very tasty high quality and nicely presented.We had a beef chop and a sirloin steak, mussels for starters and several side dishes.Everything was amazing. Even the standard bread on the table, accompanied by garlic butter, was fresh and very tasty!Brasserie au bon plaisir is not a cheap place to visit daily, but definitely an amazing place to visit on special occasions.Will definitely visit again in the near future.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"We visited on Sunday so the place wasn't too busy, which was great. Very romantic environment, we were lucky enough to listen to live music by ""Ni Vu Ni Connu"" which was hauntingly beautiful. Great Food (we had a T-Bone and the Fillet Mignon) although the cheese croquettes we had for an entree could have been better. The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful.Overall a wonderful experience, highly recommended",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,more than one hour service vejry bad and not professional not qualified staff for the French restaurant they did not bring you ice packet for white wine only after we ask for .,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,French restaurant in Nicosia. The service was good and the waiter very helpful and polite. The food was tasty. Romantic atmosphere .. the French wine was smooth and tasty too recommended by the waiter,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,First of all the service moderate.The wine was overpriced.We had the same brand in a wine bar in nicosia for allmost the half price.The table setting was poor. No table clothes. Knives and forks on bare table.Snails modarate and not fresh. Stakes just ok. Side dishes modarate.In a general you dont pay what you get.What a pitty.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,During the week it was and we could find a table easily without reservation ... I doubt to be able to do so during the week end. The specialities they have at that day the cheese pie and camembert fires with salads was tasty and the main dishes the salmon and the sanglier were good too. The rose Cypriot wine was so delicious and the service was good and quick. I liked this place and also the background live music. To try.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Visited with friends. Had a great time. High quality of food pure fresh ingredients. Fast and polite service. All time value.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Great food and experience with great service. We went a group of 7, there was live music but all was so very well organized that we could listen to the music as well us enjoy our dinner. Highly recommended.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,The best French restaurant in Cyprus (and Greece).Fine quality of the fresh prepared meals. I would for sure visit it again.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"terrible food, good service, overpriced. To cocnlude... never again! Maybe this the reason we were only two tables friday night ..",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Best steak in Nicosia love it! I went with my husband and enjoyed the atmosphere and also the friendly stuff Alexandra! We will go again for sure!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"I went with my wife. We ordered a steak with french fries and fillet mignon with rice.The good:Both meat plates were excellent cooked and as requested. Their sauces too. The waitress was really helpful and explained everything (dishes of the day and from the menu). The desserts where also great.The bad:Unfortunately, the side dishes were not as good. Actually, the french fries were nearly uncooked inside. Few of them were black. The rice was also undercooked. I’m pretty sure that if we complained, they would replace the dishes. I have no doubt about that! But, we were celebrating our anniversary and enjoying everything else, so we decided not to complain. We are not that difficult with food, so we ate everything.Place, atmosphere, music:The place is at a good location with a parking place. The atmosphere and decoration is good but needs improvement. The music needs to change for sure! I do not expect to listen to movie soundtracks like Frozen and The lion king in a french restaurant :)You can expect us to come again but we are not going to be forgiving! :D",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Good quality food and great service! We ordered steak; it was cooked perfectly and it was delicious! The staff was very friendly and hospitable! I would definitely recommend it!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"Not a very great experience. Food was average and it was expensive. There was a singer there, singing the same songs over and over",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Went for brunch, great food, croissants especially, great prices, great service! 🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋 They even had a violin!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,The reason why I deducted a star was the first 3 wines we ordered from the menu were not in stock! Its a family run restaurant with fresh foods of the day and excellent steaks. Lovely French wine and very good service. Décor and atmosphere is a bit on the low side but overall a great alternative for a good steak than other steak houses in Nicosia. FIllet steak and Rib eye were both excellent and homemade sauces were great.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,The food was amazing! The best french restaurant! I recommend the steak tartare and the fresh mussels with garlic! The service is also great and the chef is very helpful. Definitely recommend it for couples or for people who really appreciate good food.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Best French food we have had outside of France. And we go to France A LOT! Fantastic ambience, service, tasty well sourced food and a passionate chef. We shall return!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"I have visited this brasserie several times with my wife mainly during occasions. The place is nicely decorated and reminds French restaurant but needed to be warmer. The staff is very friendly. The mussels are delicious, I was less impressed by the meat plates. The French wines selected by the owner are tasty. The prices could have been better. Overall, this place is an oasis of French gastronomy within Nicosia but certainly needs improvements.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"First time here, to celebrate our anniversary and it felt as if we were dining in a brasserie somewhere in France. Les escargots de bourgogne were appetizing, as well as the homemade garlic butter and the fresh baguette. The steak and the duck were delicious and cooked to perfection. Les profiteroles could be more more fresh, but that is a minor issue. Service was impeccable. We'll be back!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,The place is very cozyMemories of France when you go insideGreat quality of the steak and very tasty garlic butter recommended to try this combination!!Owners very friendly and helpfulGreat selection of winesAnd very nice desserts especially the cheesecake.If you want to taste a hi quality juice steak this is the correct place !!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,love it... nothing else to be said. best mussels in town. great specials too. from the start with a kir royale to the end with a crepe suzette it is pure gastronomic bliss,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,Nice and cozy with traditional french recipes. Good service and well cooked french food. Good selection of wines.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"For the past few years i read a lot of good reviews about this restaurant but i did nothave the chance to visit it. So this year i decided to take my family to celebrate my birthday.I love French cuisine and i must say that this restaurant serves Authentic French cuisine.But its not just the food. From the moment you step in, you forget that you are in Nicosia and you get the feeling that you are in a Brasserie in France.The food is authentic French so are the owners of this Brasserie. Special thanks to them for the nice surprise for my birthday. Even though i did not mention on my reservation that it was my birthday, somehow they figure it out and i got an authentic ""Bon anniversaire"" song.Just try it and you will not regret.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Authentic cuisine, quality ingredients, excellent service and every time to the same high standards!!! Bravo!!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,I have had several dinners in this lovely french bistrot and I have never been disappointed.I am still amazed at the passion with which the two owners run this place painstakingly choosing high quality original ingredients cooked perfectly and served with courtesy.Ther menu is extensive and so is the wine list.I keep going there and so shoulkd everybody that feel that food is a serious business that has to be handles with passion and art.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"This is something that Nicosia was missing. Traditional French cuisine, a proper one. The vibe was perfect, lighting and music. Staff was more than helpful and willing to answer all our questions regarding their special plates. The menu is rich, also their wine list.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I decided to take my hubby out for his birthday and it was a wonderful night to remember, it reminded us of our trip to Paris back in 2015. A true french bistro filled with authenticity which is not often found in Nicosia. We were greeted by the owners youngest daughter who was the sweetest little thing so polite and adorable. The food was delicious, the wine amazing and the atmosphere all round romantic. We will definitely be going back especially with summer so close - it has a beautiful setting outdoor where you can see the street enjoying a candle lit dinner weather romantic or fun with friends.. definitely recommend Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"We went with friends that had studied in Paris. They really loved it. Steak was great, but the mushed potatoes was cold, so we asked them to put them in microwave. The atmosphere is nice, but bit dark for my taste.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"A true french bistro. This is the only place where i trust to eat fresh mussels. Flown in every Tuesday i believe. We shared as a starter the 500gm mulles marinier. Absolutely fresh. For main we ordered the 200gm steak -medium. The steak was mouthwatering and as always cooked to perfection. Please donot ask for a well done steak. You will kiil it.Note that there is plenty of parking on the side of the building but there is no signage for it. So donot worry where you will park. Price wise if you opt for the steak and also take a bottle of wine, you should expect it to be on the high end. Occasionally they have accordion nights which is really french!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,Just try any steak!! But the best is the steak with foie gra!!! Waiters are very friendly and helpful. Prices are ok!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Great food, great service and excellent pricing. My wife and I had the mussels and it was excellent. Great quantities, awesome flavor, and it really hit the spot. We also had the NZ beef and it was fabulous. The wine and the dessert rounded out the evening. They even have a parking space behind the restaurant which is such a rarity in Nicosia. The location is somewhat confusing to find but in reality it is quite easy, but once you get there, you will never forget where it is located. Check them out. Well worth it.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Unexpected find in Palouriotissa with nice food. The steaks were delicious and the wine was reasonably priced. The live music on the day was perhaps the downer but not enough to spoil it. Good experience all around,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Great food very nice atmosphere we had soups ciche and a wonderful steak! Very much recommended and will definitely come here again,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,I was impressed very much by a small French restaurant in Nicosia. Service and dishes - TIP TOP. Will definitely come back again,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Is not easy to find a place in Nicosia to look so romantic and to be so cosy but after you dine here, you will go back again and again.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I have only great things to say about the restaurant, the service was great, the prices were good but the thing that stood out was the food, not only delicious but made with perfection! I had the steak witch is hard to find a good one here in Cyprus and I was very impressed! Cooked to my perfection! I will definitely be coming back!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,"Ambience and service is good albeit somewhat shallow. No consistency in appearance of staff.Escargot, frogs legs and fois gras were not well prepared and the seasoning on all dishes was somewhat inaccurate. The fois gras was cold in the middle. Mussles were ok. We did not have a steak and French bread was scarce, four little slices in a small basket.Not what we expected overall.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Fantastic steak & foie gras. Truly delicious - excellent service too! We will definitely be coming back!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"I suppose that you shouldn't believe all you read...all the good reviewes. I was looking forward to eating here being a 'Francofile' & missing all the lovely foods I eat in France. However, I do not like reheated food & my mussels had not been cooked fresh & were from the lunchtime with a sauce put over. I have had a restaurant & am well aware of waste in the industry but I would NEVER have served this to my customers. My husbands fillet steak was cut with the grain & not across & was not the right shape & tough, in our opinion not fillet (my father in law is a master butcher). No atmosphere & over 100 euros for a two course meal with wine. NOT RECOMMENDED & such a disappointment. NIL POINTS.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Perfect steak mussels and foua grass don't forget 2 eat :))))))) if have mood for desert trie profiteroles . Love the music and the hospitality of the owners,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,"When the time elapsed between the appetizers and the main courses is more than an hour then you cannot say much more about a restaurant….Saturday night, when we entered the restaurant there were just a few tables. The first impression was nice. Cozy place, small menu, nice selection of wines, some plates of the day...the night was promising...But then, when the restaurant was getting crowded the situation became very- very bad.We finished the appetizer and we were waiting for the main course. The plates of the appetizers All the tables around us were looking in the kitchen's door. The mean time between the appetizer and main course was more than hour. Not just in our table but also in the tables around.The waitresses were totally confused bringing wrong plates, wrong drinks, wrong bills etc. You felt that nobody had the control in this place and nobody had any idea of what was going on.The excuse was that one waiter was not able come that night.I don’t believe that this should concern the client. They are the professionals and they should have sought for a solution! It was Saturday night after all and they knew that they were going to be full! What was their plan? How did they plan to handle the situation? The result show that they didn’t.Actually they ruin the night of so many people that night.Now concerning the food, nothing special. The steaks were average as well as the appetizers.Of course, when paying almost 100 Euros, for a dinner with two appetizers, two steaks and a bottle of wine, you at least expect much more professionalism.I am really very-very disappointment since I choose that place as a surprise for my husband’s birthday. I really expected much more and I am totally upset.Definitely a “never again” place.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"A unique culinary experience, professionnal staff. I can tell as a french native than this french restaurant really nice and according to other dinner in Cyprus Restaurant, one of the best in this island !Thank's for this moment.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The perfect mix of good food and ambience! The restaurant is cosy, the staff are welcoming! The food, well our homemade pate was excellent, our steaks melt in the mouth tender and the bernais sauce was to die for! Finishing of with a superb creme brûlée, what more could you ask for! Can't wait to visit again think we could make our way through the menu with several visits!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The hospitality of the restaurant was top notch so kind and helpful with the meals. Also the food was amazing, we ordered the stake and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. Definitely a place to visit when you are about you won't regret it!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"I had been trying this restaurant since its opening at all the addresses and each time there was something wrong. So I voted with my feet and did not go there anymore. And then, a few weeks ago I saw it at its new location and decided to give it another go. I went with my partner and we had an excellent meal. The waiter was very helpful. I loved to taste the typical French dressing of the salad (that I had not tasted for years) and the french fries were the best that I have ever tasted in Cyprus. We will go back tonight",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"French cuisine experience that is worth to try. Our second visit was certainly much better than the first. The T-bone steak that my boyfriend had was amazing. I had muscles, the blue cheese recipe, and they tasted great. Fresh and smooth texture of the sauce. Good selection of wines. The service is good though there is still space for improvement.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Excellent traditionnal French Food full of flavours..You can find anything you can expect from a Real French Bistrot/Brasserie.The Tournedos Rossini was amazing and all starters outstanding.excellent wine list with very reasonable prices.Not to be missed .Service is very good and Owner full of attention and life and caracter.We highly recommend you to go as our experience was TOP.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I visited restaurant many times during my stay in Nicosia. Every time it was amazing. Last time I was there in March for opera night. You should not missed this. Singer is something special, that you can't find everywhere. We tried several dishes, but mussels are the best. With blue cheese or garlic, and one time they had special offer with some smelly cheese that I don't remember the name but it was worth it. Steaks are cooked to perfection and you can choose your own sauce(blue cheese wins again or wine sauce). And foie gras... I can't name all delicious choices, are too many. Restaurant is ok, spacious, appropriate also for big companies or families. Service is quick and very helpful,specially with wine menu (Bordeux is the best). Owner, with her French English is always present and ready to tell you history or story around the food that they serve. Magical. If you haven't tried it yet, you are missing a lot.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"The atmosphere is nice. The service is poor - the waitress confused the different recipes of muscles we ordered and we ended up eating the food of each other. We tried four different muscles recipes, one was smelling bad, two were average and one was good.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"You can choose from the menu anything you like and you can be sure to enjoy a lovely meal with the french finesse ! To complete a wonderful meal, you have a delicious variety of desserts !",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Beautiful restaurant with experienced waiters. The waiter was French speaking and possessed advance knowledge on French cuisine therefore was able to advise us on our order. The owner was even there who appeared cheerful and on top of management. Deserts were on the house and the wine was divine! Will definitely go back!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,typical french brasserie with top notch food quality. excellent variety of steaks but also wild boar and duck. fresh muscles and excellent frites. you can not go wrong with this restaurant!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The restaurant has a very nice menu, food tastes very good! The staff is friendly and extremely helpful! I would recommend it at anytime!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Excellent food and service .Great athmosphere!! Staf was realy helpful . We had some of the specials of the day and than took a main from the main menu it was delicious. Highly recommended!!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"the chef from france certainly knows how to cook, steaks are food and. ussels are excellent, its they type of place you find in europe where the biggest attention is given to the food instead of building a palace without good food that we see in cyprus. all th dishes are very well cooked and wine at very reasonable prices",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"everything was perfect,the atmosphere,the service,the food. I had a steak and it is one of the best i have eat.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Had the mussels and wild pig. Mussels were excellent, wild pig was good. Personal service by the owners, good and friendly. Looking forward to coming back again.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Amazing food, very nice, cosy yet elegant, atmosphere, at the right balance. The service is excellent, very helpful, charming and delicate. I have been there twice and I have to say that I have tasted some of the best food on the island. We are talking here about real food, the way it should be: a gastronomic experience for those who appreciate their senses, and do not want to limit them to a watered down experience made to satisfy everyone. This is not for the mainstream tastes that do not want their taste paletes to be excited.Most new restaurants opening in Nicosia practically all taste the same, with the same menu: some burgers, a fish and a risoto and that's it. Not bad but boring and repetitious. But Au Bon Plaisir is for real food lovers. People who are not afraid to really sense the amazing tastes of good food, be that garlic or good cheese or an intense marinade. And finally, a place that doesnt have a burger on the menu!If you want something more easygoing, try the great mussels that everyone is talking about. But if you want something more exciting, try the Beef Bourgoignon, the duck with garlic or the amazing wild boar. And some of the best french fries I had for a long time.Very good value for money, since the portions are quite large and the quality excellent. You will pay the same if you go for meze at a tavern with drinks.Au bon Plaisir is not for everyone. It is not for those who cannot handle really good food.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"A large beautifully decorated place with ambient atmosphere. Excellent and very helpful service. An interesting menu, with various dishes as well as daily specials to try from, including vegetarian dishes, wild boar and other traditional delicacies. Portions are satisfactory, dishes are delicious; a successful blend of different tastes, not heavy at all and you can really feel that you're having homemade food. Although someone might find it a bit pricy, I believe that prices are very average for this type of food, given the quality. Desserts are very good too. Overall, delicious food in a great environment, and I'm visiting again.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"There are so many wannabes so many ""lemme drop some butter"" into the stew and that makes it French but this is the original mussel escargot steak oysters place been a few times and the only time it disappoints is when there are no seats. Food is seasonal + you should try the wild boar if there is any",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Favorite restaurant in Nicosia, the only place besides Paris that the mussels taste that good. I always choose it for special occasions.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"Atmosphere was really nice, crew very nice and polite (family i believe).but salad was really poor, main dishes were ok but priced as great.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"For the Christmas meal it was excellent. My wife is French so we were looking for something traditional and we got it. Nice atmosphere and very friendly people. The owners are from the North of France and hence the menu, wine and decor was very French. Don't be put off by the kitsch Eiffel Tower outside, this is a restaurant worth visiting!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Contrary to the last review we thought the food and atmosphere was great. We dinned here last evening and found the place to be a charming restaurant. We both had French Onion soup to start and steak's for main. The waiter was extremely helpful and suggested a wine for our menu choice. We are from London visiting Nicosia for two days and fancied a change from the normal Cypriot cuisine. Considering the normal cost of a good night out we thought the restaurant offered good value for money. We would recommend this restaurant, and would happily return.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"I've read many good opinions about this place so I went to give it a chance.However.... I must say I am very disappointed.The food there is heavy, fat and tasteless. I regret going there a lot. I had a stomach ache for the whole night. I didn't finish the dishes the were so bad. I tried 5 different thing, and they were all unaccptable.Never before I wrote a negative opinion about a restaurant on the internet, but this one.... really deserves it. I have to warn you people. DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The restaurant is hidden in Larnacos avenue but for those who have discovered it it's an experience worth going back to. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the food is genuine and heart warming and the desserts are divine! Try the steaks with succulent matured flavourful meats, the buttered garlicked snails and do not miss out on the fluffiest most delicious creme brulee you have ever had caramelized to perfection right in front of you!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I arrived late at Au Bon Plaisir so I missed the frog legs but everyone said they were delicious, so I take their word for it. I tried the beef bourguignon and it was fantastic. Very tender and tasty. The wine was excellent.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"I will begin by saying that I have lived in Paris for almost two years so I am able to judge more honestly than most nationals in Cyprus.This restaurant I very much doubt has FRESH mussels every Thursday as promises... and the food is an average Brasserie style with overpriced food for the standard it claims to offer, but better than most other restaurants.I must say they do a very nice selection of mussels served with great fries and a divine Creme brûlée which the staff ignite in front of their customers, far better than the profiterole which was bland and chocolate nothing like in Paris.The warm foie gras is quite nice and perfectly cooked but the steaks we found to be a little stiff and that was not because of a particular type of cut, as the filet mignon was poorly too in flavour and quality. The onion soup although fresh almost seemed like it was from a tin probably because something was missing in the recipe to create the unique french style my case buds are accustomed to...for Cyprus standards I must admit it is very good overall especially when they host Opera nights and stimulate the ambiance...makes a classy change from listening to annoying silly Greek music everywhere I go most ridiculously in Sushi bars.This restaurant keeps a higher standard than most.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"I have been there twice so far and both visits have been very different, albeit sharing the same undertone. The actual setting is quaint and the variety of menu items are quite satisfactory. What ""lifts"" the menu, is the weekly specials they have on offer on a little blackboard the waitors bring to your table and describe to you. The owners are very friendly. The second time i went the restaurant was completely empty and lacked atmosphere. This however may have been a ""one off"". I had the rabbit fricasse and the grass fed veal, as well as mussels and duck confit. All were excellent except i wasnt very thrilled about the veal. For it's price i expected something more decadent and tasty. Overall a good experience and worth a visit",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The service was perfect, they would not rush you and always there when you needed them and very friendly.Food was probably the best food I've ever had and the same comment was true for my friend. We had mussels marinere as a starter and they were fresh not frozen and you could really tell as the taste was exquisite. Then I had Fillet Mignon on mushroom sauce and the taste was like nothing i've ever experienced. It was so tender and tasty. My friend had duck and said it was the best duck ever so I took a taste. Mildly crispy on the outside and the inside would melt in your mouth like hot chocolate.Price: We had mussels, duck and fillet (and sidedishes) along with 2 belgian beers and cost us 55euros and was worth every last cent. Fresh ingredients are costly and the cook marvelous, a real French chef!Atmosphere, there was Jazz music in the background and lighting was a bit dim which makes for a nice relaxing and a little romantic feeling. The music volume was exactly perfect, you didn't need to raise the volume of your voice but you could appreciate the music.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Happy to say that this is still my #1 best restaurant in Cyprus.If you love good steak, either fly to South Africa, or go to Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir here in Nicosia.In my last visit, I tried things other than steak, and to my amazement, they were also the best I've ever had. Their salmon dish was to die for.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"Arrived and parked in the back on the left side of the restaurant (no sign). We were seated promptly. A LOT of items on the menu were not available. That turned us off right away. We ordered the onion soup, croquettes, steak, lamb chops, with a salad and a mash potato. Lamb chops were very good according to our daughter. The soup was a bit bland. Steak was okay but a bit dry. We usually order rib eye because of the fat content - not a dry steak. My husband did order the French beer which he did enjoy. The atmosphere is a bit dark.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"After 2 years of living in Nicosia and dining out regularly, this is the place to which we always return. Au Bon Plaisir is unmatched by any other establisment in Cyprus when it comes to French brasserie cuisine. The select and carefully considered menu is a rare delight and caters to all tastes from 'playing it safe' to the refreshingly un-PC. Anyone can go here and have a really enjoyable dining experience. The accompanying wine list is superb. Go there at least once - you will not be dissapointed. Well done Gatienne and the team!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,The food is perfect. Every time we visit this place we leave with a tasteful filling of france. Muscles are perfect and can be combined with chips or rice or whatever you choose.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"cannot say that I am a regular there but I visit once in a while - let's say at least 3-4 times the year. so to its new location I had to give it a go and I must say I find that they got better... muscles with wine sauce and creme brulee seems to be my favorite, yet I always enjoy their imports on the wines",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Just had my first visit to this restaurant and it will not be my last! Good, french flavours in everything we tried - gazpacho, ruccola salad, delicious moules mariniere and an excellent salmon dish. Nice, friendly service and a welcoming ambience. It's not the cheapest dining option in Nicosia, but if you need a change from Eastern Mediterranean flavours, this is the answer AND they have gluten free options. We enjoyed it.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"The Restaurant moved to a new location which is not as attractive as the previous one but parking is available and easy. The mussels I ordered were not of first choice however the cooking was good, unfortunately when your raw material is poor, there is little you can do to improve the outcome (I hope they could buy better mussels). The staff was very friendly and kind. The restaurant has a very nice selection of beer from France and Belgium that one may not find anywhere else in Cyprus!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I've experienced this restaurant over and over, and to my surprise, it only gets better.Not to repeat my previous reviews, I will just mention some things new to me and new to the restaurant which I've fallen in love with, such as the French beer Ch`ti, their amazing muscles with white wine sauce, fantastic wines (especially the exclusive imports) and as always, the best steak I've found in Cyprus.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,We have visit the restaurant a few times and surely will come back again. Well cooked quality steaks and maybe one of few places to enjoy really fresh mussels ! Friendly staff ready to explain you every recipe in the menu about the ingredients and the size. Prices are good for what you get! I recommend to try the creme brule!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"Au Bon Plaisir is a decent restaurant. It offers French cuisine and as such enjoys a monopoly in Nicosia. However, the food itself is not consistent and your experience varies greatly depending on your choice of meal.We had steak Tartare (In May in Cyprus, I know...) and ended up feeling unwell for the nextr couple of days. Other things, like quiche and T-bone steak were good. I would only recommend going there if you really need your French food fix. I don't feel the decor, trying to recreate a rustic French Brasserie, works either.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"Lovely interior, friendly service but food is average and over priced. I went with high expectations but was dissapointed. The food is nice, but nothing spectacular especially being charged 33 euros for a steak and presentation was basic. I heard there mussels are excellent but they were not available as they arrive fresh on Thursdays. The atmosphere is casual, warm and friendly I would give another chance to the place and try something other than there meat dishes (and not so expensive)",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"When you visit this place you will feel as if you are enjoying a romantic dinner in France. Carefully decorated, quiet and excellent customer service. My favorite dish was wild boar with sauce and potatos. Also don’t be afraid to try the escargots (snails) with butter garlic, simply divine",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"It is a lovely place with an artsy, relaxed atmosphere and casual crowd. The food is special tastefully presented and tasty. The service is excellent.It is a place one returns to even if prices are on the high side.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I was looking for a place to celebrate our anniversary, specially seafood so went to tripadvisor and after reading some comments on different restaurants decided for Brasserie au Bon Plaisir. One bad comment made me look at the reply from the owner which comforted me when I realized that no matter what, if something would not be perfect the owner would be ready to investigate.We love mussels and what a surprise: they had arrived that same day ( they told me that they normally arrive from France every Thursday) they were as fresh or even more than in Paris at Leon de Bruxelles where we used to go regularly. My wife preferred the shrimps with Curry and coconut sauce, the appetizers were big portions, by the end of the dinner my wife told me that she had really enjoyed both plates and it remembered her the time when we went out when young and had so much food! Not to tell that the bread and special butter would have you eating it non stop, gladly we did not have to wait for the starter!. Definitely if you are looking to celebrate a special occasion I sugest you this place, we will be back for the deserts we could not have and the beef that I can not find in Cyprus markets that I also miss when we lived in Paris. Thank you for these good moments you had us partake and will surely see us again.Bernard And Mary R.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Finally discovering an authentic -French Cuisine Brasserie- in Cyprus with a warm welcome!...We were heading for one of their great theme nights where Talented International Opera Singer, the one & only Onaki, is performing there from time to time.Opera, Wine & Food and ..Great Conversation!Awesome time, as the cosy candle lighted decor, the quality of the wine & beer, the-Terroir- menu kept us all mouthwatering.Was hard to decide between the Moules/Frites,Tartare, freshest Oysters or Confit de Canard as these courses were passing by, on to the other tables...:)I chose the Confit de Canard, with a glass of Merlot in the true Bistro/Brasserie Tradition.Everyone seemed to enjoy the stylish & convivial premises & so did I.-Au Bon Plaisir- is a Must; warmly recommended.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"I have visited this resto to celebrate with my husband our wedding anniversary. I have ordered mules. the sauce was nothing special, actually i realised it as it arrived, before even try it. My food was not accompanied with neither by potatoes nor salad. very very average option.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"First Time and sure not last one!!! Great food!! Great wine!!! Great mood!! Waiters with smile, ready to explain anything you ask!! We spent a lovely Saturday night..you should try it!!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"We had a nice dinner here overall but really the expectationswere much higher than what we experienced.The food was ok, nothing fancy but well cooked for the most part, thedownside is that it is pretty overpriced for what you get.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"We enjoyed our dinner and the owner and staff were very gracious. Winter is their busy season and if you don't have a reservation go by 7:30 cause by 9:00 pm you won't find a seat. Wine selection was good, mussels were delicious and the parsley butter to start the meal was the best I've had. An easy walk from Ledras street where our hotel was. Took about 25 minutes and well worth getting out and away from the touristy restaurants.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Top service, excellent food great atmosphere. I recommend the cheese funde assorted with cool cuts, any main platter and the cheese cake!!!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"We come here on special occasions and tried out the new location on Beaujolais nouveau day. The food was as always amazing and the new place boasts a parking at the back, comfortable sitting area and lovely atmosphere. If you have not been here already, try it, you will not be disappointed!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,During the festive period we had the chance to have lunch with a few friends over there.The ambiance was really cosy reminding of a rustic restaurant in the French countryside.The dishes were homely and original .The wine was exquisite.Everybody there was polite and quite helpful.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,a very nice place for those who love french cuisine really great experience. the costumer service was very good,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"After moving to its new location, the Brasserie has finally found its bearings. The new location is more spacious but has retained its warmth and cosy atmosphere. During the Christmas period, I had the opportunity to taste their festive menu and was impressed with the quality of the food and the care and efficiency of its service. The oysters were great, fresh and appetizing, the suckling pig nicely cooked and crispy served with roasted potatoes. Finally, the cheese cake was as always home made and excellent. Au Bon Plaisir is one of the few restaurants in Nicosia which has an authentic French menu and which has matured into a great place to spend an evening out.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"From reading about the restaurant on Tripadvisor, we decided to try the restaurant in its new setting. The Service and food was really good, especially the homemade foie gras and the Wild boar are delicious. But it is a downside with the location of the restaurant - simply to far away from Nicosia city centre.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I took a small class of 12 French students one weekday evening and had previously agreed on a 'discovery menu' so they could taste as many French delicacies as possible. They appreciated the fact that the waiter Mario spoke to them in French and was very patient with their hesitant French, they tried everything (even frogs legs and snails!) and the owner Gatienne came and explained the different concepts and the history behind each traditional dish which made the whole experience very special and memorable to them all. I'm sure they'll be back for more! Merci a toute l'equipe, en salle et en cuisine",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"We have visited the restaurant for the first time since it moved a couple of weeks ago. The whole place needs some more work to be completed but it really looks and feels much better than the previous one.We arrived late, so we were one of the last orders. The delay we faced is mostly our fault so no complaint on that. I would suggest to anyone going for dinner to avoid arriving late. The place was full but it felt quite comfortable and the music was really pleasant.Food was once more perfect. We had snails, soup, a salad and some mussels for starters. For mains we got some pork dishes and i personally had the wild boar dish which was amazing.We shared two desserts which are not to be missed by anyone! Order all of them and share. It's a great experience.Great experience, the owners are lovely people and are very eager to help and explain the menu and the dishes.I definately recommend it. I am writing this review based on the fact that the restaurant has changed location and i still believe that we have had the best meals in Cyprus in the Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Now that they moved it is much much better as it is bigger and there are those special private corners where a group can enjoy their evening privately. The only handicap are the chairs which are not very practical when you want to move it closer to the table !!!!So here we can have a good meal, good drinks and a wonderful time ! with the same excellent service from everyone working there.Keep it up Gatienne ! and the Brasserie's team.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,The brasserie has recently relocated to a new venue. Very nice environment and the staff is very helpful and attentive and always! We had the pumpkin soup as a starter and it was excellent! For main we enjoyed our steaks(medium rare) and we enjoyed them! For desert we had creme brûlée which was amazing! Will definitely go back for some tartar next time!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"This restaurant was a really good surprise! From those that fill you with enthousiasm and you want to visit again.Very kind, helpful and enthousiastic staff coming from different countries. The lovely owner of the restaurant (who is French) was present and was explaining the type of the original french recipes we could taste.It also has a very charming atmosphere, making you dream of being in another place, outside Cyprus.I would surely recommend a visit there! What I 've also learnt is that they are moving soon in Larnakos street, Aglantzia. So, make a call and ask them where you can find the restaurant.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,French cuisine. Excellent steak. Very good wine list. Mostly suitable for couples or small groups. Will definitely visit again.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir is a simple and cosy restaurant set in a quite street close to the centre, which offers the best French cuisine in town. Great food and wine selection. I would definitely recommend trying out the mussels with french fries on the side (tip: check in advance for when they receive the fresh mussels).",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"An authentic French restaurant in Nicosia, with a welcome from the owner as warm as the evening air! Good choices to be had (including Charolais beef), cooked to perfection and a nice range of wines. This is a must visit place for great dining.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Celebrated our wedding anniversary today. It's great to unexpectedly discover awesome place in the heart of the city. We had a great time and enjoyed the place, the cuisine, the service. We will visit you again :) Thank you Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,A fantastically good French restaurant in the heart of Nicosia that my wife and I have been visiting over the years. Superb food with the highest quality meat and fish; in most cases straight from France. A must for anyone seeking the most of culinary delights in Cyprus. Full credit to Gatienne!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"What can I say about this restaurant?Perhaps the most stunning part, is that it's in Cyprus. In Nicosia even. You'd expect this kind of place to be found either in the heart of a big city or lost in the midst of the most secretly special places in the world.Without a doubt the best restaurant in Cyprus. If I find anything better, I swear i'll come and edit this review.I eat my meat blue, aged and with a passion.The meat here was just as good as my favorite restaurant in South Africa. Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir's t-bone (850g) that I ate was cooked to perfection, from the Charolais cattle (imported from France), aged some 30+ days.Wine was stunning, dessert (home made vodka and french chocolate desert) was fantastic, appetizers were amazing, meat was exquisite, host, environment, music and overall experience was perfect.p.s. They had me at the garlic butter. Divine.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Been there for the first time even though we have heard many good words and read many good reviews during the past year.Small place, located in the business centre of Nicosia. Corner shop on a small neighborhood, nothing special as far as the looks and the view is concerned.We were welcomed by the owners. Great couple, happy and really friendly. We immediately felt comfortable.We got the kir royal to drink through the reading procedure. Really nice way to start a dinner. The owner helped us a lot with the menu even though she was busy with other tables.We got French snails and the salmon quiche for starters along with a salad. We expected more taste from the quiche but that's all. Everything was very good.For mains we got the duck confit and the beef bourguignon.My wife really liked the beef. Great taste, it looked good and the portion was quite good.I was a bit disappointed with the duck confit. It's served with potatoes cooked in the duck's fat that delivers an explosion of taste in your mouth. But that was it. A plate with a piece of duck and some potatoes. I was expecting some more eye satisfaction to be honest. The duck was cooked perfectly and I totally enjoyed it but the dish lacked imagination.We of course got deserts. The creme brulee and the cheesecake, and we were not disappointed. Try any of the 2 or both for sure!Prices are quite good for a French restaurant. We didn't get steaks or mussels or expensive wine so the bill was fairly good for what we had.Overall I can easily say that it is a great experience and we will definitely return once the restaurant moves to its new location.I had some reservations for giving 5stars but the great service, the help we got with the menu, the relaxed ambience and the eagerness of the owners to suck feedback from the clients reassures me that my comments were and will be heard.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Nice small place! Went there a few times, and never left disappointed. Try mussels with garlic... Great dish!! Could't stop !!! Everything is fine but just to know it's an expensive place to dine.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"This is one small restaurant where I meet regularly with friends - for different reasons every time and even different people. I was never disappointed and each evening was a unique experience.Food is excellent and so is the service. We have our little corner usually but on every other occasion I can choose where I prefer to sit.....The who menu is unique and soooooo good ..... the very best in all of Cyprus ..... are the french fries ....... local potatoes, fresh and hand cut ...... when served hot and crispy !",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,You can count on getting a really good steak at this restaurant also fresh mussels several different ways if that is your preference. The fries to accompany these dishes are probably the best in Nicosia also. There is a good choice of wine also.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"You cannot say you have tasted food till you visit this restaurant. It was an experience, more than a simple dining out. My senses was played with till I no longer could keep my excitement. It was the best meal I had my entire life. It was perfect in simplicity. The chef, the host and the owner all made my special birthday dinner a memory that will last for all the good reasons.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The service and hospitality was excellent. The very kind lady who owns the place was very happy to help us with our choices and explain the ingredients and the way the courses were cooked. We ordered two steaks which were marvelously cooked and their sauce was great. Great place, excellent service, good location, amazing food. Thank you!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"For a long time I have used trip advisor for many things, especially restaurants. I'm a bloke who likes my food and I have always thought I should put something back for the useful information I have gained over the years. I'm pretty lazy though.Tonight I had a meal that has not quite dispersed my lethargy but has urged me to comment. I had the mussels to start. The sauce was so good that the hostess (and owner I think) instantly knew to bring me copious amounts of lovely soft bread to soak it up. I wasn't bothered what my wife had - I was eating. The confit duck was the duckiest duck I have tasted in ages. The accompanying side dishes were cooked to perfection and wonderfully seasoned. I know my wife had the steak; It produced noises from her I haven't heard since before we were married. The service was fantastic for the majority of the evening, the hostess was very welcoming and thoroughly engaging.I was pleasantly surprised by the bill which was more than reasonable. I left a 30% tip which I still felt was not enough but any more would have been just showing off. Whilst it is still within the city centre, it is a little bit off the beaten track. It's well worth visiting though. I have to travel to a different country to eat here and I'll be coming back.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"This week we have been here on Friday and once again today. That's how much we like the place and food. So all lazy readers just stop reading this review and just head there to eat.For the ones that like to read the whole review go ahead :)We tried so many different dishes over the last few years we found the place and they are always prepared so well and so tasteful with every bit of detail.Hostess is always willing to explain every bit of detail of how dishes are cooked, recommend dishes according to everyones taste and likes. She is always polite and staff are polite and helpful as well!On busy days it can take a bit for main dish to arrive but after you start eating you forget all about that ;)Enjoy the Venaison Rossini and Cheesecake our personal favourite of favourites! :)Already recommended it to friends and love it...so why are you still reading ;) Go there :)Achilleas & Andria",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"We hadn't been here for nearly two years and I want to confirm that, as far as I'm concerned this is still the best restaurant in Nicosia despite having somehow gone down to number 18 (!!) in the TripAdvisor rankings. Brilliant menu, excellent food, friendly and attentive service, as always. Not cheap (especially if, like me, you are tempted by the most expensive items on the menu) but certainly for what you get I consider it excellent value for money. We paid €100 for a three course anniversary meal for two, with a very nice bottle of wine. As I said not cheap, but you don't HAVE to order the venison tournedos Rossini (though it's worth trying. Amazing!).",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"We had a decent dinner starting with the Quiche Lorraine which was tasty but slightly odd as it had Roquefort in it. The pork filet mignon was good but slightly over seasoned. Beware though if you order the crab as it is not dressed and unless you know how to dismantle a crab you may feel a big disgruntled. It is also quite expensive (at 20 euro) for what is basically just a boiled crab with a few lettuce leaves. On the plus side, the Loire Sauvignon was good and good value, the owner was very friendly, and we were offered a complimentary dessert.One thing to note is that the location shown on Trip Advisor is wrong, although the address is correct.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Great little French bistro if you fancy something totally different. Imported French beef, crab, mussels, duck, pates, and a constantly changing menu based on the ingredients imported from France week-by-week. And always served with their great hand-cut French fries!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"have been a huge fan of their steaks for ages! Seriously the best one sin Nicosia, a favorite of my family and friends too! Always the best choice for a celebratory meal!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

Plus of course wonderful company.An intimate nice space to just eat, dring and be merry! And one more word - creme brulee - prepared right in front of you.I wanna go back..",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The mussles this restaurant serves you do not find nowhere in Cyprus. This dish is served in very tasty, fresh and best delicious sauces accompanying with amazing homemade frech french fries...The mussles delivered straight from north of France and actually kept fresh in special fridge temperature before serving.Steaks are also recommended to try out with a full body red wine imported from France. You may ask for wine recommendation on the spot and be pleasantly surprised. Prices for French wine are very reasonable unlike prices for Greek wines in some other restaurants in Nicosia.Highly recommended...Irina Tryfon",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Last night we went for dinner at Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir the food and service were amazing! We were really impressed and we definitely want to come back! We tasted unique flavours of wild boar and beef. Paid 35 euro per person for a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"I have been to Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir with my husband many times. I have now stopped going for one reason: Quality of service (big delay) which creates an uncomfortable feeling. Me and my husband ordered the ""all you can eat mussels"" and because of our previous experience, we told them from the beginning the number of casseroles we usually eat (2), so we would not face the previous big delay between casseroles. We were very dissappointed as we were ignored. The time interval between casseroles was so big, that by the time they next casserole arrived, we lost our apetite... This happened at each one of our 3 visits to the restaurant. Also, I rate is as a very expensive restaurant.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,we visited last night the restaurant and we were amazed by the quality of french food. we tried onion soup and salad with apple for starter which were excellent.we ordered for main mussels which are definately recommented and chicken with mushroom cream that was excellent as well. the waitress made a great choice of wine which had a great taste. service was fast and very welcome to help you. definately deserves a 5 star and cant wait to visit it again. recommended for everyone. not very expensive and food is of great quality!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"We went there with friends and family Friday night to celebrate a birthday! The staff were very accomodating, polite and eager to serve! Their suggestions for food and wine were excellent! Also friendly to ""gluten intolerant"" customers!The place was packed with people of all ages literally!Small, cozy, friendly and great food and drinks!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,It was my first time . Special and delicious dishes. There is a nice atmosphere. Served in a friendly and pretty . But i think a bit expensive so a rocket salad and two steak with a Red wine (15 Euros) total amount was 97 Euro. These charges are not included in the dessert or fruit.Many ThanksHasan,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Every experience that I had had at Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir has been not only charming (due to the friendly owner and waiters) but the food never fails to impress and I walk away wondering when I can next return.I haven't had a dish that has been anything less than superb and dream about their steak and fries with bearnaise sauce as well as their onion soup, but seriously, everything is worth trying.The best restaurant I have tried on the island. They've got me absolutely hooked.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"You look for places, where you can enjoy beautiful food, good service and warm people. Tonight we found such a place. Thank you.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Generally the comments that I was hearing from friends recently was that the place ""was not as it used to be"" so we thought to try it ourselves. I must say that the food was very nice and the staff very friendly. Of course it was a quiet night and we got attended very well as there were only 2-3 tables there having dinner. The fillet steak was very well seared and properly cooked as ordered (medium rare). My salmon was very juicy (it is very easy to overcook and destroy the fish). The wine came at the proper temperature indicating that they respect their customers and the product. I think the place is still what it used to be. it is still a good choice in the generally very poor restaurant scene of Nicosia. Given the times though, I would review the pricing (both for wine and food). I will definitely go back.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"This cosy and unpretentious locale was a pleasant surprise on a busy Saturday night in Nicosia. Cassienne, our French hostess, was courteous and pleasant. The food was of high quality and skilfully prepared, and although the restaurant was full, we had the attention of the staff when it was needed. We ordered mussels in marniere sauce with fries, and a Norwegian salmon steak in honey mustard sauce with rice and vegetables. Both were delicious, and we topped it off with a crème brulee singed to perfection at our table! Although the prices are not cheap, they are reasonable given the quality, and not beyond the reach of an average pocket. The location of the restaurant is very urban, on the corner of a built-up town square which is not very scenic; but Cassienne compensates for it by creating as pleasant a space as possible with wooden tables, paintings on the walls and romantic candles. In all, it was an experience worth repeating several times!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,"I have been to this place many times over the past few years and I have to admit that quality was good, but it seems that things changed..The waitress presented the specialities of the day and I ordered one Quiche (with 4 cheeses) and mussels (with blue cheese).Quiche was microwaved (or something like that), it was cold in the middle and warm at the edge, was oily (greasy) and gave you the impression of sommething that was made few days ago...Mussels were fine but definetely not something special. Average quality that you get at lower budget restaurants. Fries were great.Wine (a French Riesling) was served at the wrong temperature. I know is difficult to keep wines cold enough during summer (especially in Nicosia) but at least you need to have the right tools to do this, I would suggest to get proper ice buckets with water.Overall service was ok but slow... the poor girl was running up and down to serve 7 tables (around 20 people).For 1 Quiche, 1 Onion soup, 2 portions (750gr) mussels and a bottle of wine we paid 90 euro which I believe is not value for money if I take into account food quality and service.Things to consider:- Chairs are not comfortable. You go there for a dinner and not for a quick coffee.- Use of table clothe is recommended. Wood on the tables has worn.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"I went there with friends last night. I had never been to a french Brasserie before so I didn't know what to expect. I got a cold tomato soup for starter and a chicken with mushrooms covered in white sauce as a main meal (the names are different in the menu). Both were tasty and I believe the portions were good too.As a desert I got a chocolate mousse. On the menu I think it didn't say that it comes with some kind of orange syrup (which changed completely the taste of chocolate) I didn't mind but that wasn't what I was thinking when I ordered it.The wine was amazing! We got the Muscat Sec, a white fruity whine served with some kind of cooler to keep the whine cool. The one thing that is lowering my rating is the prices.Overall nice place with excellent service, good food but overpriced. I might visit again sometime for a second chance to try different things.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Love the location, very quiet at the centre of nicosia, very good service, excellent food! You have to try the mussels with blue cheese or the streak!!!!!!!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"This cozy French restaurant really gives you the feeling you are in some Parisian neighborhood! Be it for a casual dinner or a special occasion it fits the bill. Food is always good and so is the service! One must always try something from the specials of the day, as well as order a portion of the French fries!!! You can eat traditional French dishes that you cannot find anywhere else in Nicosia as well as specialty meats and fish! A definite classic you can rely on, for an all round experience, time and again!!!.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I first came to Brasserie 3 years ago and since then it's my first choice for a casual dinner or special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries).I love the atmosphere that makes you feel so cozy and relaxed. I enjoy the hospitality this restaurant provides their customers. But I simply adore the food that always meets my expectations and everything is so fresh and home cooked. I tried so many dishes that I can't say which one is my favorite. I just pick and order based on my appetite and always want to go back for more fresh French cuisine.I recommend everyone to visit Brasserie because you don't know what you are missing!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"The restaurant is small but cosy. The owner is french and the waitresses speak english. We were a group of 13people and all tried different dishes. All of us were satisfied. The 2 that have ordered the duck were satisfied by the taste but the portion was too small. The beef bourguignon was excellent. We had white and red whine and both of them excellent. We tried the quiche, the salad with apples and the french salad with the cheese and ham for starter and were so tasty that nothing was left in the plates. For dessert we had creme brulee and it was superb, it tasted exactly as the ones we have tasted in France. We all shared the bill and paid 18euro each (4quiche, 4 salads, 13main dishes, 5 desserts, water and 2wine bottles). Very good price.TIP: Every Thursday they import fresh clams and oysters.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"expensive restaurant for mussel and wine, quality 'mediocre, mediocre service, not up to the real French cuisine, especially the seafood, not recommended.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

50,It was just perfect! Nice atmosphere and very good food. What to tell about the staff? Excellent service. Sure i will go back to taste some other dishes ;),Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"We ate here on Fri night and had a lovely meal. Huge starters and delightful main courses. The house wine was excellent, as was the service. We were allowed to take our time and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I can only suggest the previous review is not representative of what is a great restaurant in Nicosia. We very much look forward to going back again soon.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,"We were very happy to see that there was a French Brasserie in Nicosia; we missed the French cuisine, and thought this experience will be as pleasant as the Name depicts “Au Bon Plaisire”. The environment is truly cozy and French, but that is all; the food was far from French quality or standards; to be more specific; the Onion Soup was poor, the Goat Cheese Salad was the only good part of our meal, the Duck Confit was average, the Burgundy Beef was terrible, and the Mussels had hair and was below average French cuisine. The service was nice, but slow. To sum it up; we are still looking for a good real French Restaurant.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Great Food, very good wines sensibly priced, very welcoming owner and staff, not the best environment, a place with lots of character.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,Friendly service and staff with uncomplicated tasty food. Good menu choice with generous portions.My husband started with a large helping of home made pate followed by some very tasty spiced mussels.My choice was sole and we enjoyed both courses.There is a small area outside for outdoor eating.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"I went there for dinner with a friendly couple, it was my first time there and i would certainly give it another go. Friendly and casual atmosphere,good food and big menu selection, attentive staff. I found this restaurant a little bit expensive.All in all a good experiance",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Mine and my wifes favourite place for many years. Most places dont last that long unless you have loyal customers who become friends. Needless to say more. Highly recommended.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Went there for brunch. Admittedly it was my first time there, but certainly won't be the last. Nice cosy place, the food was tasty and fresh. The service was excellent. Can't wait to go again for lunch and dinner.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"This restaurant is certainly worth a visit. The food is excellent and it is quite evident that the owners are passionate about their cuisine. The choice of menu is quite extensive considering the size of the venue and as I have a great love of REAL french food, I was completely spoiled for choice. Very rarely do I sit and eat a three course meal, but I managed to do exactly this and thoroughly enjoyed every mouthfull. The evening I dined there was the 2nd. January and the owner apologised that some of the staff were on leave, however, her children took over the role of helping to serve at our table and it was indeed a pleasure to see such young children actively helping out with a smile on their faces. The atmosphere was totally relaxed, the wine delicious, and our group of four all agreed that we had enjoyed the most superb meal. I live in the UK, however, I will definitely return to ""Au Bon Plaisir"" on my future visits to Cyprus and I have ""sung their praises"" to friends resident in Nicosia. May I take this opportunity to wish the Brasserie every success for 2013 and beyond....they truly deserve it.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Very Friendly owners. Great Service. A nice place to enjoy your dinner. Very good food, a lot of choices.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Lovely French bistro in Nicosia. I particularly like the mussels and foie gras though most dishes are very good and what you would want to see from a French brasserie. Service is friendly, efficient and informal making for a relaxed family run ambience. There’s a good wine list and the decor is cosy and welcoming. Add it all up and what’s not to like?",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,Brasserie Au Bon plaisir!! a heartfelt thank you for making me feel that I am back in France everytime I am at the Brasserie. The food is delicious and varied and there is always some wonderful wine to be tasted. The owner and her husband are so friendly and you can see that this is a restaurant which is run with a passion. It is my job to critique and I recommend without a doubt that you visit Brasserie Au bon Plaisir for a fabulous experience!!,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"My wife wanted to take me there for a special treat. Got there suprised to find some cozy place sort of what we were used to in France... expecting nothing, opened up the menu and started ordering, what was soon to become by favorite starter : Madeira sause foie grass, and then off to some serious Moules Mariniere...AND finally found a place to enjoy my favourite ""orangina"" soft drink (hooray!!!)Only problem: you will find your self looking and drooling at other peoples' dishes, even on the same table... (thank God my wife doesnt mind if i catch a bite out of her dish - well at least not usually) - but that will just kept me going back for moreOk, so its a bit more expensive than your average restaurant (and perhaps not an every day visit), but the freshness of the ingredients, the quality and the taste just kicks away a lot of ""more"" expensive restaurants bringing this one sticking out from the norm...every time we visit, there is always a suprise in the ""daily specials"", which usually ends up on the table! so always something new to try...warning: make sure you treat your self an all-you-can-eat moules night, and forget your troubles away :)on a busy weekend day, may get a bit noisy, but hey, its might be a french restaurant, but its still in CYPRUS - and cypriots tend to be ""LOUD"" :( so dont be suprised there... Best to reserve early and get a ground-floor table, or in the summer nice quiet place outside...enjoy... bon apetitoh boy - im hungry now...",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
30,"The food is nice but the night we were at the restaurant the service was not so good.The restaurant was full and we had to wait forever for our food to be served. Later, the lady who served us- i believe it was the owner- said that the cooker had broken and that was the reason for all the delay. If she had told us that from the beginning, we would have just ordered only salads,cold cuts and cheeses, instead.The dessert was really dissapointing. We ordered profiterol but what we got was 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with tiny slices of profiterol choux and chocolate.My friends found the place cozy but I really wonder why the walls are so badly painted.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"Good french restaurant, with nice and fresh ingredients. Interesting old style decoration. Worth a visit and why not coming back. Nice and friendly staff.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
20,"Au Bon Plaisir is 'the' french restaurant in town for the very simple reason that there is no other one. The owner is a charismatic French lady. I have visited the restaurant several visits, hoping for improvement and left disappointed each time. The food is at best at bistrot level and one can eat better somewhere else for a lot less.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,The restaurant definitely has a French feel and the food is great. The staff are very friendly and they were responsive to our requests. We will definitely return to this cosy restaurant.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Me and my wife visited Brasserie au Bon Plaisir on our anniversary day. Small cosy place in Acropolis Area in the Nicosia Center. The waiter (typical French Guy) was very helpful and kind. He explained all the dishes for us. We tried the Champagne with Cranberry juice and it was very good. The food is good cooked and nice taste. The house I wine I had was from the region Anjou in France and was really good. Their sweets are quite expensive, but Creme Brule was really delicious.I will surely recommend the restaurant to my friends and I will definitely go again.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"It's highly recommended, particularly if it's a special occasion. I admit it isn't cheap, but trust me, you get what you pay for. We had aperitifs and the apple and cheese salad to start with, and then I had the trout from Kakopetria with almonds (it's always a plus when local produce is used), and my date had the beef bourguinion. The food was very nice, the atmosphere was friendly and relaxed, but what I appreciated the most about the place is the service; yes at times they were slow because they were packed, but they were super polite and the lady owner knew the food very well. Overall a great experience and I would definitely return to try out the steak tartare and their amazing desserts!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The restaurant is very nice and the atmosphere is always friendly and warm.We like to have a dinner in this place on week end or sometimes at the middle of the week. On Friday or Saturday it is better to make reservation in advance, a lot of people want to try delicious mussels and oysters!Special menu is also good (we visited on St. Valentine's Day this year) and offer quite a lot of food.Wines are good and staff always will recommend you something special if you are in doubts regarding wine.The only thing which can stop to visit it is quite expensive food (for Cyprus prices). But the food is really special and delicious, so it worth that price!Strongly recommend this place to couples with romantic mood and all people who like french food and easy friendly atmosphere.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Since we discovered Gatienne's charming restaurant last year, it quickly became one of our favorite places, which we keep coming back to.We enjoy coming both just my wife and I, or as a family bringing our young son with us, on several occasions we have also come with friends or the extended family.The food is always excellent, the wine is generously poured at very reasonable prices.My favorite are the steaks, one of the very few places in Cyprus where you can get a truly good steak without it being overcooked, my wife usually enjoy the mussels and our son loves the home cooked french fries.In addition to our usual favorites, we have tried most of the dishes on the menu during our numerous visits, and they have all been very well cooked.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"Actually I saw an ad for the restaurant on Facebook - It was the first time I actually clicked on an ad so I can see what it was about (there was mussels on the picture - and I love mussels).As soon as we entered the restaurant I was a bit sceptical, but I should not have been.We have been going there for over 1.5years and I cannot brag about it enough! Their prices are reasonable, and their food is absolutely fantastic! I have not tried something on the menu that I did not like.The personalization really does it for me too. Its nice knowing that the owner cares so much for her establishment; telling us what is the specials of the day, as well as recommending food based on your personal tastes.My fiance and I try to go at least once a month for our 'date night' and it never fails us.I've seen the other reviews on here, and there were comments regarding the recycling van that comes up on Fridays, to be honest, although it would be better if it just didn't come, I cant say that it ruined my evening whatsoever. It is literally a 20second nuisance.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"This is an amazing piece of France in Nicosia. Food, wine, the whole atmosphere (and Jerome :-)) will call back your best memories of this most beautiful country. We just love this place.

50,Saying that the food was JUST good would be an understatement.... Tonight my special someone and i were the last people to leave brasserie. Needless to say that we enjoyed every second of it. It was a combination of excellent food and service. Definately going to visit again. The garlic sauce mussels are delicious. Looking forward to taste the crabs.,Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

30,"We just visited this restaurant.+ What we do like is the French atmosphere, music, French cuisine, service, starter.- But what we don't like is unwillingless to open air condition or to install fans outside (in Nicosia it is very hot in August), the size of the portions (they are really very small) and the price which is really expensive considering the size of the portions.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

40,"I visited this small and cosy restaurant at the start of the week with a friend and was delighted with the quality of its dishes. It offers a good French cuisine in true fashion and the service was very professional. The gambas with honey and mustard that I had and the trout with almonds that my friend ordered were delicious, as was the fresh fried fois gras we took as a starter. Good selection of wines too. Not cheap (estimate about 45-50 euro per person) but definitely worth visiting especially for a romantic dinner or a special occasion. Will be going back for sure.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

Because he especially was craving escargot and duck, I did some research and found that Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir had the best rating amongst its customers. We completely enjoyed our very relaxed meal and definitely will go back again this time with friends. I especially enjoyed the curried Mussels, which are served mostly on Thursday and Friday's as long as they last! This is not a pretentious restaurant rather original with well prepared and thought out dishes! The owner and her staff are sincerely friendly, kind and attentive. When I asked a question about the dishes I received knowledgeable information about the preparation, origin etc. I hope to get back soon and this time I may try their fish of the day, whereas my husband wants to try the Wild Boar!

40,"Romantic twist with a touch of artIf you understand the concept of Bistros/Brassieres restaurants, Au bon Plaisir is the perfect example. We’ve been there during an exhibition even for George Lanitis. We had snails in garlic butter which was presented with authentic manners, my burgundy beef took me back in time when I went on a tour to France during the late 90s. The beef was very soft and flaky, fused by the lovely Burgundy wine. While my fiancée had the duck comfit, and it was another level of excellence.During the meal, I had my eyes on the next table having frogs legs, which I will definitely go for it the next time.In general we had a great time and wonderful service, I would strongly recommend it.If you understand the concept of Bistros/Brassieres restaurants, Au bon Plaisir is the perfect example.

20,"First visit the food was very good (don't try the crab, it's ridiculously expensive and not even close to fresh crab though).Two weeks later, the food was a DISASTER. Duck was pre-cooked and re-heated. Cheese platters were poorly presented, quantity was more suited to toddlers, and very overpriced.Perhaps the only two things you can't go wrong there are the creme-brulee cooked right in front of you, and the onion/crouton soup. The rest are randomly good or phenomenally bad.Whatever you do, don't go on a Saturday, the food is plain bad.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

So you can all imagine my excitement when we arranged to to there...but unfortunately my disappointment as well. To be fare starter was not bad, but nothing special either. My crab though was terrible, everybody on the table tasted it and they agreed. Creme brulee was actually a burned creme since the waiter who came to our table with a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar on top she burned it !!! And the creme was not tasteful. The environment was nothing special and definitely overpriced. We paid 210 euro for four persons. Did not worth 100 euro for what they served us.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

I would highly recommend this restaurants to those who appreciate good food. Well done to the lovely owner who took some time to speak to me and my wife. Thanks and see you soonHarris Larnaca",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"I've been in 'Au bon plaisir' twice and I was pretty satisfied from what i had and from the place itself in both times. It's true the place is very much alike an authentic French brasserie and will remind you Paris for sure! Gatienne (the owner) is a very friendly lady ready to explain and help you with your orders. Food is very nice (loved the tartiflette but also tried several really delicious starters). Sweets are good too but there is always space for improvement. I like the fact that you can give your phone number and get informed with all recent arrivals and special nights there. I will be back for sure. Regarding comments further below (that I personally think were really written on a bad purpose and I disagree with them) I have to say that the only thing I have to agree is the Chinese waitress which served us on the first time I was there and she really did have an attitude and could be more polite. But well, this is not to influence me in any way. I strongly recommend this beautiful place! You will find yourself in a completely different space in Nicosia with much character and nice flavours!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

30,"I went to brasserie au bon plaisir few days ago with some friends. I heart that is a small place but when i got in I realized that the ground floor except the fact that it was very small, the tables were so close to each other that the person who was going to sit in the inside could not pass through to have a sit so we had to move two tables. You also don't have any privacy at all, and it's like you are sitting on the same table with all the other customers. We sat down and the waitress a very polite young woman came to bring us the menu, as well as the board with the 'plate du jour'. We ordered a goat cheese salad, cheese croquettes and frogs legs for starter. I was expecting much more for what I heart for this place. The salad was plain romain lettuce cut in stripes with the knife with 4 pieces croutons with chevre cheese gratinated with parmesan and some cubes ham. The cheese croquettes were more like potato croquettes you could roughly taste the cheese inside. The frogs legs where nicely cooked, but with no taste. For main we ordered fresh mussles with blue cheese which were very nice, a beef filet, and I ordered the wild boar. I liked it very much the taste was excellent and the meat was very soft. The wine selection was excellent and accompanied the food perfectly. Finally for dessert I ordered the chicory creme brulee, which it was bruleed on the table by the waitress. Generally it was nothing special and I was expecting much more for its reputation.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"It is one of my favorite restaurants in Nicosia, mostly because of its amazing, authentic atmosphere. The staff is very helpful and friendly, they know the food they are serving and they know the wines to go with it. I have to admit that I always take mussels, just changing starters/salad, but my husband keeps trying different dishes, and the food is always good. The owner is usually around, talking to people, either just greeting them or giving advice on the food choices. I will surely keep visiting",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

40,"It has been the first time I ever visited this place even though is found close to my office. I had many reviews before that many of them contradicting. Something that was holding me back. I booked a table on the phone with the lovely lady who owns the place. I believe she is the soul of this place... and she trully loves what she is doing.Decor... warm ambiance, cosy environment, simple decoration (a bit outdated but the building doesnt help as it is considerably old). The ground floor of this place doesnt have many tables ... most of it is on the first (internal) level, which I found very interesting as it reminded of a loft of some kind. We opted to sit upstairs and immediately the very gentile waitress came to suggest an aperitif, which we took. A kir royal. Which was not bad at all but could have been better if it contained a tiny bit more of crème de cassis. But that is just a matter of personal taste.The wine we had was a anju, 100% cabernet franc, rare in the wine world, but a variety I personally prefer.Starters: onion soup gratinee (for my wife) frog legs (for me) and a salad with warm goat cheese and bacon (for both). The last one was meant to be kept for the main course too. All of them 3 plates were satisfying. My wife absolutely loved the onion soup and she could not help picking some of my delicious crunchy frog legs in garlic sauce. Salad was good, nothing out of the ordinary... I had better.Main course: Steak tartare. Me and my wife, are steak tartare lovers and it is plate I usually prepare at home for her, rather than the opposite. I had a speical request for the owner which she so kindly accepted. To bring me all the ingredients and let me mix the meat with them, so I could control the exact amount of quantity I wanted for my tartare. Meat quality was good but not excellent, but I have to admit is difficult to find good beef appropriate for steak tartare in Cyprus. Most of the time I get it from wholesale merchants from New Zealand, Uruguay and Argentina.Overall I would give 75 out of 100 for the eating experience (of the particular plates I had) at this establishment. To be honest I got more than I expected and I will surely return back to have some more of the dishes on the menu and have a better and perharps more fair idea for the place.The only negative thing I found was the price... I understand that most of the ingredients are hard to be found and quality must be maintained but still... I believe this place could attract much more people if they had a better pricing policy.Congratulations to Madame Gatienne Thibaut for what she accomplished with this place.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

The food was delicious and my steak was cooked to perfection, the wine too was excellent. The service was friendly and relaxed and the owners seem to really care about providing a quality product. This was a special occasion so we did splash out a bit, but it I found the prices generally reasonable and I would certainly expect to pay a lot more than €23 for the lovely St Emillion. Will definitely be back (maybe for the Sunday brunch next time).",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I was lucky enough to be taken to dinner at this 'off the beaten track' hideout by a very respected food critic who lives in Nicosia. It's her favourite restaurant so I had high hopes. I was not disappointed. The atmosphere was very typical French (there were tables of French speaking folk playing traditional games even which added to the authenticity!) and the service was very attentive and polite. Of course, it's nice when the owner knows your friend but still...it was perfect really. Food: I had the goats cheese salad which was a very large portion which was super as I love it and haven't eaten one for a long time! My friend had the mussels which again, were sizable in portion and delicious. The steak I had for main was cooked perfectly too with the best pepper sauce I;ve had in a long time. My friend had the steak tartar which was very tasty. For dessert I had a chocolate pudding which was calorific and devine. It's great to find such a restaurant in Cyprus and have told many people about it already. I'll be going back very soon.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

50,"The restaraunt follows the requierements of high quality service.Having experience of visiting a number of restaraunts all over the world , only few of them can be called ""mine"" . One of those restaraunts is ""Brasserie au bon Plaisir"" ,which can be characterized as the place with warm athmosphere , delicious variety of food menu as well as proper chosen wine card which are targeting to satisfy the needs of different level customers.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"The brasserie Au Bon Plaisir has the same quality atmosphere as at home : caring unpretentious. I just wish we would always be at home in the mood to be genuinely smiling to one another the way the owner (Gatienne Thibaut) and the staff do at this restaurant. And I wish we would always us the same quality ingredients and care in preparing them.The seafood was comparing well with specialist restaurants in continental Europe, and their wild boar was just melting in the mouth. Their deserts are very convincing, from the creme brulee to the Pink Lady, specialty of the house (ask for it !). And their choice of wines is outstanding, covering quality French and Cypriot wines.The dinner doubles with an art exhibition, as the restaurant also displays the works of contemporary artists living in Cyprus. We have some at home ... they have more and sometimes better.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir

After a while someone from the kitchen came to give us some menus, and told us we had to wait for the waitress. No problem there except that we had to wait for the waitress to return from Carrefour with the steaks “imported from France!”The menu was just plain white printed A4 paper where a lot of liquid had been spilled over so it was very difficult to read. The waitress tried very hard, maybe even too hard as she had clearly no experience whatsoever, but ok, everybody has to learn. But explaining us every dish on the menu (what we don’t need since we are from Belgium and we don’t eat anything else but the French kitchen) and explaining it wrong as she did not know where she was talking about, was quit annoying.So far the service… unfortunately it didn’t stop there…The salad with warm goat cheese was just 2 leaves of lettuce with 4 small bolls what you can get from the freezer in a store (probably also Carrefour) as a party snack!The main dish was not properly cooked and the sauce was shifted…Last but not least, the bill was way too high even if the food would have been good.Carrefour may be a French chain; it is still no excuse to say that the food is imported from France!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
10,"I have travelled all over the world and have been to many French restaurants. This place is far away from the words ""French restaurant"". The only French there is the owner. Where can I start with a review of this place? I have been there 3 times. I hated it from the first time and would never have gone back if it wasn't for some friends who insisted on going the 2nd and 3rd times. The food is badly cooked, the third time I really didn't want to eat anything there, that's how muh disgusting the place is, and so I just tried to go safe with a fruit salad: yikes! Looked like marmelade, the fruits were not fresh and the texture was mushy!!! I mean come on! Who can go wrong with a fruit salad? It's ridiculously expensive and the service is for laughters. All the waiters are Asian, nobody speaks Greek or decent English for communication purposes. There's one particular Chinese waitress who was very cheeky and even had an attitude! The atmosphere? A joke! Wherever you are seated, the smell from the kitchen will get you and after you go home your clothes will stink! If you are seated downstairs accross the till, you will enjoy the unique view of all the rubbish they store behind the till (empty bottles, papers, carton boxes, etc.). I'm sorry but whoever thinks this place offers a decent equivalent to a French bistrot, probably has never set foot outside Cyprus. Brasserie Au Not So Bon Plaisir is good enough only for a village that doesn't have any other tavernas!",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
50,"I didn't expect that it will be sooo great the food. me and my partner went there for our first anniversary and we felt like we were aristocrats! The food was so elegant but also it kinda fell that i was eating a homemade french food. tha menu list it'a little small but that's not a problem because inside you find things that you will not find anywhere else in nicosia. I mean they have FRESH OYSTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wow!!! many products from Burgubdy and also famous traditional french foods! We took a light wine from Burgundy and we really enjoy it. we never taste such wine. its taste it's very different from any other cypriot or greek wine. The price per person is at about 30-35 euros including starter, main dish, wine, water, and dessert. It's a very good price for the quality of the food! Don't be afraid to open your wallet and let yourself feel such a great experience. I will definately visit it again!P.S. --> The owner is very polite and smily!!! :p",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
40,"My local expat friends and I like to go evenings, reservation permitting, for a nice evening of down-home French appetizers, apero, main dish, dessert, coffee, and digestif. Part of the fun is the staff who really work to make the experience memorable. Local dishes we enjoy are mussles cooked French style, pork or wild boar, and chicken. The desserts are typically French also with a really nice creme brulee and cognac to follow.The wines are either French imports or also local Cypriot wines for the most part. Selection is adequate.",Brasserie Au Bon Plaisir
