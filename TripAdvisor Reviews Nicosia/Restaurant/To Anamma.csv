50,"A real hidden gem of a lush, green courtyard behind Ledra Street. The kleftiko ovens are right there in the courtyard with you! Beautifully atmospheric and traditional, and you can tell the food is prepared with love.I eat grilled chicken almost everywhere I go, and this marinated, grilled chicken just had to be the best ever - so tasty and succulent.And my hard-to-please husband must have eaten kleftiko in almost every restaurant in Cyprus, and he said that this was seriously the best ever. He is actually still raving about it, and he never raves.The wine was reasonably priced (we had a very nice carafe of red), and the service was wonderfully friendly. You can tell that they really care about their customers and their food.We can't wait to go again.",To Anamma
50,Excellent food and excellent staff! The people work there were so kind and helpful. Highly recommended!,To Anamma
50,Disappointed that we couldn't cross over into Turkey due to Covid 19.Decided to get something to eat..... How fortunate were we to discover this Gem! Drawn in by the Souvlaki!Sat down then noticed a sign advertising the courtyard. Peaceful and very pretty.I ordered the sampler for one and my girlfriend ordered the Pork cooked in a clay oven. Kotsi Xoirino. Six hour slow cooked with potatoes.The Food was simply wonderful!Enjoy!,To Anamma
50,I strongly recommend this restaurant! Comfortable place with nice decorations. Meal was amazing especially their marinated chickenüòç,To Anamma
50,"We put in the address to Apple maps but it showed a different location, so it was hard to find, but I‚Äôm glad that we didn‚Äôt give up. We had lunch here and sit in the garden, they have ventilators so it‚Äôs a nice weather there. Our waiter was AMAZING (usually I don‚Äôt write with capital, but he was truly amazing). He was an older guy, he probably did it in his whole life, you could feel that he really want to make you a special experience. The food was also very tasty, we ordered plate for two (version A), it was more than enough for two persons, and it was the best kebab we had in Cyprus (maybe the best in our life). Unfortunately Nicosia was a bit dead because of Covid, hope this place will survive it. If you‚Äôre there, don‚Äôt forget to visit this place, we‚Äôll be back for sure on our next holiday.",To Anamma
50,This was a fabulous place to eat. We spent a lovely Sunday afternoon jere sat outside in the courtyard. Wonderful kebabs all reasonably priced and you get a free local dessert at the end. The lemon juice and soda is absolutely delicious.,To Anamma
50,"I almost never give a 5 star review, but this place deserves it!First of all, don't be fooled by the plain looking outside on the main street, but go to the beautiful terrace in the back.We had a warm welcome and were served with a smile.My husband had the fish and I took the moussaka, wich was fingerlicking good! It was the best ever and it was a big portion.A pitty my stomac wasn't big enoughto try more of their food.A must try!",To Anamma
50,"The frontage is deceiving, as it looks a small eating area, but out the back it is large and very atmospheric. The food is freshly cooked and delicious. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. Would certainly recommend this place.",To Anamma
50,Really nice restaurant on the main street lovely garden setting in the back Great food and good service plus very reasonable meal for 2 was ¬£19 including a beer and soft drink Loads to eat and well cookef,To Anamma
50,"We visited in winter, and the inner yard was very atmostheric and warm, after we've eaten our dinner the staff surprised us with small desert delights. Needless to say our whole family had no complaints.",To Anamma
40,The inner yard of this place takes you years back when the local residents of Nicosia used to live in the area. The classic wooden furniture and the green foliage of the yard add to the effect. The food is based on meat selections (i think they offer also some vegetarian) with nice side dishes originated from Greece and Cyprus cuisines. Their kebabs are very good and worth a try. Overall the place is worthy of a visit to eat and drink when you are in the area. Its usually full so you have to either reserve or wait for a table to be freed. The prices are good in comparison to what you receive.,To Anamma
30,Reasonable service and average food compared to other food I have had in Cyprus. Quite a long wait too.,To Anamma
40,Friendly staff. Great courtyard. Great atmosphere. One complaint only. Slightly unreliable. Sometimes food is unbeatable and then you go to enjoy again and leave dissapointed. But i suggest you try it for sure. Every place has an off night.,To Anamma
50,"Our friends who live in Cyprus took us here for lunch on our day out in Nicosia. We sat in the very nice outside seating area at the rear of the restaurant. The staff we‚Äôre very attentive and friendly. After looking at the menu I decided on moussaka and my wife had chicken. Both meals were well cooked and delicious. Our friends had the same as us . So 4 meals, 2 beers , 2 ice teas as a can of 7up came to ‚Ç¨51 . First class service and very nice food . A must .",To Anamma
50,"From Ledras Street, To Anamma looks like another noisy and discouraging spot, but enter the lovely garden courtyard and a sense of tranquility arises. The courtyard is populated with a good mixed on locals and travelers, all enjoying the meals. The menu really appealed to us and we ordered way too much food. We started with a delicious moussaka, with a touch of nutmeg, and continued with lamb skewers, meatballs, tomato salad, dips, and panna cotta. And then a spot of ouzo. A great meal, and very reasonable - highly recommended",To Anamma
40,"We went as a group of four for lunch. We ordered various dishes like kebab, souvlakia, shieftalia etc. Food was good, maybe not exceptional, but it was cheap and that made it value for money. A good choice overall.",To Anamma
30,After a waiting period our souvlaki platter arrived incomplete and raw. The staff were warm and inviting.,To Anamma
40,"We had dinner here after flying into Cyprus - and it was amazing. Service was great, food was delicious and super affordable. Definitely recommend for visitors to Nicosia!",To Anamma
50,"The servie was very nice and the food was delicious! Definitely a recommendation, especially when you have the chance of sitting in the traditional garden!",To Anamma
50,Loved it. Fresh and great value and lots of choice. Salads were crisp and imaginative and the small stuffed pitta is fairly large!,To Anamma
50,"We travel to Greece a lot and were pleased to find familiar Greek options on this extensive menu in the capital of Cyprus. The saganaki cheese was perfect and I had the best tasting, authentic moussaka for ages! Very reasonably priced and friendly staff made this a lovely late lunch in the divided city.",To Anamma
20,"To Anamma Family Greek restaurant in Nicosia. The garden venue was excellent as was the food unfortunately the rude waiter completely ruined our evening. We were enjoying our starters and about two-thirds of the way to finishing them when the waiter brought up our main courses and piled them onto the table stacking dishes upon dishes. When informed we hadn‚Äôt finished our starters, and could he take the main courses away until we had he became offensive and walked away. The meal was not a pleasant experience.",To Anamma
50,I subbed here are couple of times when staying locally. The staff are amazing and the food is out of this world.,To Anamma
30,"The food was really good, a nice menu with a lot of plates, the venue as well is really nice and cozy.The service though it was not great.They did not clean the table, leaving a dirty spoon from the previous customer, we had to ask twice to remove it.Then we waited quite a bit to be served, (but maybe because there were many tables)On some plates they forgot the tzatziki sauce, we asked for it and did not bring it, they forgot again.Might be better the next time in a less busy day, we recommend this place anyway for the food.",To Anamma
50,"On July 25th 2019 my wife, a cousin of us and I had lunch at this restaurant. We really enjoyed their delicious food!! In fact Mediterranean food is excellent! The place is very clean and the staff gives excellent service; They are very polite!! If I have the chance to travel to Cyprus again, for sure I'll visit this restaurant one more time! I recommend it!",To Anamma
40,"Good choice for Meze in a cute garden when you are in the center and looking for souvlaki. Salad was fresh and dips were above average. Very good value for money, I would dare to say the best from other souvlaki places nearby. Great value for money as well",To Anamma
40,"We came after sightseeing here. We took the Meze mixed Menue with the majority they have to offer (available for 2), for 14,90‚Ç¨ each, making a total of 37‚Ç¨ adding 0,5l house wine, sod drink and a big bottle of water. This is of course relatively cheap, especially if you consider the amount of food you get!Sample of different Cremes and sauces, beetroot, Pitts bread, salad bowl, haloumi, mushrooms, sausages, 8 meat skewers and some additional pieces, followed by small dessert.Most tased quite well, some were a bit disappointing like the lamb (more bread than meat in the mix).We sat in the covers backyard area, which was super busy at 20.30pm. Very limited room for each table but good atmosphere.However people are smocking a lot :-(Service was partly prompt but friendly.Good place for a cheap dinner with big food amounts. Don‚Äôt expect any extended gourmet tastes or special service.For wat it was nice!",To Anamma
40,Not enough food and could be more spicy but the meat has an excellent quality and the staff is super nice !!,To Anamma
50,Strongly recommend this place. The waiter Janis was super‚ù§Ô∏è Good atmosphere and tasty meals. Cold fresh wines,To Anamma
20,"Visited place for first time few days ago.Unfo place and food did not cover our expectations.The back yard is the plus of the restaurant but that‚Äôs all.We taste the grilled mushrooms (4 in a portion ‚Äì overcooked), the Greek salad (not bad) but the biggest disappointment were the pork, chicken and kebab sticks.Overcooked meat without juice and very very small pieces (4 small pieces per stick), same the kebab that was not juicy and not tasty.Service was not bad but me review is regarding food!",To Anamma
30,"We had the set menu. More food than you can eat. Genuinely Greek, but no exciting tastes. The house wine was better than feared. ;-)",To Anamma
50,Absolutely outstanding food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Leda Street. Great quality combined with a great service. I could speak highly enough of this place.,To Anamma
50,"Had dinner here last night. We chanced upon this restaurant after quickly perusing Trip Advisor recommendations.The food was superb! Wide selection on menu including good vegetarian options. Service was excellent, especially in helping to accommodate special needs.Prices were very reasonable, portions very generous. Highly recommended. Shall gladly return.",To Anamma
40,Value for money. Excellent service. The food is very good. The prices also. Highly recommended. Their salats are very good.,To Anamma
30,"I loved the moussaka at this place, ate it all and wanted more. The staff was nice but seemed a little confused, kinda slow.",To Anamma
40,"Don't be fooled by the apparent lack of seating from the front - there is a pleasant covered garden area in the rear which makes for nice surroundings.Had the pork as recommended by the waiter and it didn't disappoint.Friendly, helpful, English-speaking service was a bonus.Thanks!",To Anamma
50,Great food. Very kind and helpful staff and very reasonable prices. Beautiful back yard where you can seat even in winter time since there is a fireplace to keep the place warm.,To Anamma
40,This is my first restaurant in Nicoasia. Staff members are friendly and very helpful. Foods are good and the portion is big. Although you can find other cheaper restaurant.,To Anamma
50,Amazing place to eat greek traditional food. The staff here was very friendly and the food was so good and so cheap that i want to go again.,To Anamma
50,"A nice patio even in winter, this place offers the possibility of combining everything you want to taste without breaking the bank and enjoying a great variety of what passes for typical, unpretentious, fast and tasty local cuisine.",To Anamma
50,"We had souvlaki for dinner and our dish was full with delicious food and frees vegetables, the backyard is amazing and the waiters are super kind. Prices are nice, and it's worth every euro!!",To Anamma

40,"If you don't know about their yard you gonna have a pleasant surprise as you see it...all the food is delicious, reasonable prices so highly recommend",To Anamma
50,The food was fabulous and we enjoyed the dining room. It‚Äôs in a courtyard with some kind of roofing then looks like it may fold back during the day. So despite being semi-outside it was lovely a warm while eating at night in November. We could take our coats off as if we were inside. The food was delicious and generously portioned.,To Anamma
50,"This is a very friendly, lovely restaurant. It is incredibly well priced, we had lunch for three people = ‚Ç¨25. The staff are friendly and great with kids. The food choice is excellent, lots of meat on skewers and gorgeous salads. Everything we saw looked delicious.",To Anamma
50,"Nice and helpful staff, good location, very delicious meal, Cute place to stay and enjoy your time. Price is Ok",To Anamma
30,"Stopped by here for lunch encouraged by the good reviews. Ordered a couple of dips , Greek salad and mousakka. Told by waiter he needed to check availability as he thought the mousakka had sold out - (strange as before 1pm). He returned and said it was available. Salad was good, freshly prepared. Aubergine dip not what I expected, tasted of cheese. The mousakka arrived later on and despite the outside of the serving dish feeling hot, inside the food was cold. The topping had a very solid consistency and had not been freshly made. Having drawn the waiter‚Äôs attention to the problem he looked very surprised and said he would serve another. After a ten minute wait a replacement arrived. This was moderately hot but contained little aubergine or meat, mostly a thick layer of solid topping. I suspect it had been reheated from frozen, which is why the first dish I had been served was cold. Such a shame the food was disappointing as the setting in the rear courtyard is very nice. The food I saw served to other diners looked very similar to dishes served in many establishments along Ledra St, but prices are much higher at Anamma.",To Anamma
40,"A place we visit quite often. The food is very good and the service is usually great (apart from once, but I still don't think it's worth mentioning)Nice atmosphere especially if you sit at the back.Would be nice to see complimentary dessert being served again! It does make a difference!",To Anamma
50,Very nice local food at really good price! Don't trust them when they say the pita bread is small!!! ;),To Anamma
50,"We had little time, found the place. It was very fast and delicious. 5 stars. Moussaka was extraordinary, it's a must to try.",To Anamma
50,"We had lunch here on a Friday. We sat in the garden area -it was pleasantly busy.Service was excellent - very friendly. We shared a moussaka, stuffed vegetables and feta salad. The moussaka was one of the best we‚Äôve ever eaten.Couple of beers and water and the bill was about 28 Euros - amazing value for money.Given a couple of complimentary mini panacottas which were delicious.Only slight down point is they don‚Äôt serve coffee or tea - plenty of cafes near by though so not a major problem.Also I imagine if full, as others have said, the tables are a bit cramped but we Would still highly recommend for the food and value for money",To Anamma
50,"We were crossing the border and we found it. We went inside, to the garden and we ordered salad and cheese with beer and it was delicious, cheap and very kind.",To Anamma
50,"Went there accompanied with my wife and 3 other family member. It was 2 pm and the restaurant was full till the last corner.Had to wait around 10 minutes to arrange a table for us. The place,atmosphere and environment were so lovely. Staff were so kind to us and service was perfect. Food was so delicious and price comparing what we ordered was so affordable. Credit to the management team there as well to all employees specially, Andreas and Anastasia who took well care about our table.",To Anamma
40,"Located on the central Ledras street, but also offering delivery, a decent joint offering various traditional dishes, good food and large portions, in pretty decent prices. I love the pork chops and salads. Definitely worth a visit.",To Anamma
30,"The food is very good and as well as prices.The problem, in my opinion, is that they packed the indoor room and the garden with too many tables, therefore the service was slow and the restaurant was very noisy.Maybe it would be better to choose the tables outside on Ledra Street.",To Anamma
50,"I have been there with friends after a meeting, the food was excellent, the service something more than excellent and the price and the end excellent!",To Anamma
50,"That's a nice place to have tasty meal without waiting for a long time. The grilled meat was delicious, the service is also nice.",To Anamma

40,"We sat in the backyard and were served immediately by a courteous waiter. We chose a variety combo meal for 2, which was plenty of food for 2 very hungry people. If you are in town and want to try some local specialties, you don't need to look further.",To Anamma

40,Very good food and nice set up behind the restaurant in the back garden friendly staff and good on prices,To Anamma
50,Been here today 5th July on a day out with my wife traveling from protaras by car . We were made very welcome by the man at the front of this restaurant. Who guided us to a table in the garden at the back . We ordered grilled halloumi with green salad that had a mint dressing this was to die for . Mains we had chicken souvlaki for her with chips and had pork souvlaki with chips each course came with Greek pitta really enjoyed it was way to much for two people but for the amount of food on the table and the cost of 18.60 in euros was bargain of the year would highly recommend this restaurant and will eat here again on my next visit . Cheers guys for the welcome and great food .,To Anamma
10,Started well with the starters but then brought my husband's main before we'd even started. Service poor due to the football on had to ask for plates for our mains. Young waiter smoking in the corner over the condiments and knives and forks. Complinedcstvthevend but all we got was a shrug!,To Anamma
50,This was my third visit to anamma and I must say this. High quality great tasting food and exceptional service. They remembered our names and our favorite dishes from last time. They served quickly and kept the table clean the whole time. We never had to ask for anything. Price is a bit above average but the overall experience would have justified an even higher price.,To Anamma
50,"It's one of the first places we visited when we moved in Cyprus. It's located in Nicosia's city center in Ledras street and it's very convenient when you don't know the city. There is also a courtyard where you can enjoy your food which is very tasty. We ordered a platter for twobwith a variety of meat (souvlaki, kebab, chicken, seftalia) a lot of potatoes and it's more than enough for two people... The people are very friendly and helpful.. and the service is nice.. we visited again after that and we are going to visit again...",To Anamma
40,"Had some seftalia, beer, zivania, and some grilled chicken (the owner's suggestion), along with a mountain of fries. Didn't finish the fries, but the chicken was good, and the seftalia was amazing--just melted in your mouth and had a subtle sweetness. It was also a pretty good value.",To Anamma
30,"the location is great, just few meters from the UN zone and Turkish side f Nicosia. the food is tasty, not priced but the personnel is somehow slow to order",To Anamma
50,Came across this while looking for somewhere for lunch. No nonsense and great simple food and very friendly staff. Thoroughly recommended.,To Anamma
40,"Some of the best cooked souvlaki we have ever had. Very well priced, overall excellent quality. The courtyard at the back of the restaurant is very cosy.",To Anamma
50,"Low key restaurant selling authentic Cypriot fare, lots of locals present indicating promise, and it delivered! Good food friendly welcome, eat outside, inside, or in between to suit the weather.",To Anamma
50,"there were fifteen of us at the table, and more than half of these fifteen were locals, boy were we spoiled ! thankfully the staff speak english, russian and greek, minimum.we were given little plates with little forks. wondered at this as the game began - the unending supply of serving plates, loaded with delicacies that gave us the very best that is cyprus. better or the same as tapas.we had to tell the staff to stop with the never ending trail of food to our table, they had beaten us!",To Anamma
50,We recommend everybody to visit this restaurant. Its the best choice you can take. Me and my fiance visted and ate and we had the best experience in cyprus!,To Anamma

30,Good food and hectic service on Sundays lunch time. In the center of town in the shopping street of Nicosia with a traditional garden with tables behind the restaurant.,To Anamma
30,The place was quite busy on a Friday evening and the interior yard on the backside nice and cosy.The beer was ice cold and the glasses too.Although the hors d'oeuvres came quite fast the main course took a long time.The fries were actually the best. The chickpea fried balls were a bit mushy with too much spearmint. The seftalia meatballs were also too mushy for my taste.The service was excellent. The waiter was super friendly and funny. They offered us a free beer on the house and free desert.Quite cheap.,To Anamma
30,Value for money. Very busy during weekends. Does nice grill combos for groups of 2+. Not bad for a weekend lunch in old nicosia area. Service is ok bit usually the place is packed.,To Anamma
50,"The best back yard ever, is surpisingly good, clean beautifull. Variety of meat and vegetarian dishes. Very good quality and taste everything fresh, and value for money",To Anamma
40,"This restaurant is on Ledra Street (the main passenger crossing to N Cyprus) which can be very busy - but it has a ""secret"" back courtyard which is quite quiet! The service is friendly and good, and the food plentiful. I'm sure it might get a little cramped in high season, but that's a sign of a good restaurant.",To Anamma
40,"We ate here for lunch and really didn't need anything else to eat all day. We shared a traditional kebab dish for 2 which was generous in its portions and very tasty. We thought we'd finished ‚Äì and then came along some traditional Greek deserts ""on the house"". We should have saved some space - they were delicious.",To Anamma
50,"We went to Anama in Lydra street Nicosia town Centre late July 2017!The food was hot delicious and in good quantities. We must of had 13 or 14 plates of food in the Meze and we all lost count at the end there were so many plates .The staff were Excellent in all their dealings with my family , and the owner / Chef gave me a complimentary bowl of Kleftico which was free of charge .They also gave us some Baileys shots as we told them we were very happy with the meal . The price was very cheap at around 63 euros . I gave a tip .Best and cheapest Meze ever !!!!Well done Anama you were fantastic thanksMr Tim ConstantinouUK",To Anamma
40,"A good place to enjoy some traditional dishes. Staff was a bit slow, but food was good, value for money.",To Anamma
20,"Food quality was good, quantity was poor and service was average. They brought us fries which we didn't order and the yogurt (which we ordered) came 10 minutes after the main dish. I asked for extra lemon and came after I finished my main meal. It was not a crowded day! But food quality was good!!",To Anamma
50,"the greek souvlaki was good no oil smelling, also the fries were ok and the service was good. prices are reasonable and the decoration is good",To Anamma

50,I never rated 5 stars to something and deserved it like this!It's just Perfect! Awesome service awesome food and very beautiful place! Is like you enter a small tavern and they take you to the back and you see a whole different world!

40,"Came to this restaurant with a large group, seeing it from the outside is disappointing, but once u enter u get surprised by the garden and outdoor seating. Very intimate, very green and lets talk about food. Diverse selection of meat from pork to chicken lamb and kabab in addition to a selection of tahini based dips, warm pita bread and fresh salad. Come eat here it is delicious and affordable.",To Anamma
40,"We were in Nicosia and just returned from the North. Strolling Ledra Street we needed a snack to keep us going. To Anamma looked inviting and the Menu was just the sort of thing we required. We sat awhile and were served by a jolly and helpful Waiter who took the time to explain the food choices. We listened and finally decided on Pork Souvlaki, Chicken Souvlaki, Lamb Souvlaki, Salad and Chips. Drinks were Sprite, Coca-Cola and Ice Tea.The food was freshly prepared and very tasty with the meat lovely and tender. A very nice meal, good service and lovely atmosphere sat people watching.",To Anamma
40,The restaurant is located in the old city of Nicosia. From the outside you can not imagine what a beautiful backyard they have in the back. The food is just very tasty. They are serving Cypriot traditional food but in a more modern way. It's just a value for money!,To Anamma
50,"Found this place on our trip to Nicosia. If your going down the road to go into the Turkish part it's on the right a couple of minutes before the check point.There are a number of places offering similar stuff but this one took our fancy.There is a back courtyard but we Sat at the front.Numerous kebabs offered and we had the platter for 2 twice.It managed to satisfy a family of 5.It consisted of chicken, lamb and pork kebabs. There were ample chips and some veg (pickled). The tzatzi was excellent.Very nice staff and a pleasure to eat here.",To Anamma

50,The place is very nice especially the rear inside garden The food delicious and the service excellent Suggest reservations before to visit the place if you want to enjoy the inside garden place for your dinner or lunch.,To Anamma

We ordered a variety of dishes; variety of two, anamma salad etc. The price was quite low compared to the quantity and quality of the food. The exotic salad was fresh and juicy.Definitely, I would visit To Anamma again and recommend this restaurant to friends!",To Anamma
10,"After all the positive reviews, my wife and I have visited this place for a lunch. But this was very disappointing. When you visit such a place the first impression is what it matters. We found a very dirty salter on the table which we had to exchange with the one on the nearby table. We have ordered Kolokythokeftedes and Cyprus Kebab. The first one was cooked in an oil probably used many times and was really oily. It was hard to eat and much more hard to digest. The kebab was supposed to be 2 shieftalies and 3 sticks of kebab. Instead it was full of potato chips which were not fresh at all. Needless to day that It took us till late in the night to digest this food. No way to return back.",To Anamma
40,Located down town in the heart of Nicosia a nice place to visit either for lunch or dinner(better sit in the garden),To Anamma
40,"We visited the place on a Wednesday for lunch. We sat in the beautiful garden which is hidden from the street and is really quiet and tranquil. The service was fast, friendly and with a smile. We ordered a platter for two for my daughter and I and the food was plenty. The meat and chicken were juicy and tasty and the sheftalies were delicious. There was a complimentary portokalopita (orange cake with syrup) served at the end of the meal. The prices are reasonable.",To Anamma

40,"Our second visit and once again, a very pleasant experience with good food. It's a particularly good choice if one or other of you isn't as hungry as the rest in your party as you can have small amounts if necessary.Quickly served and piping hot, we'll definitely visit again.",To Anamma
50,"This is really a surprise. The patio is beautiful decorated. The food is excellent. For a price so low that you just cant believe. The portions are huge. We took a Greek salad as a starter. My partner had a mixed grill, I had the vegetarian plate.And then the staff. So nice. After one visit they already remembered us and knew what we preferred.",To Anamma
50,We've eaten here a few times and have never left disappointed. Food is great and portions are huge. We get the meat platter for two and never manage to finish it all. Service is very good and staff friendly.,To Anamma
50,"This Greek restaurant is on Ledroa Street, and 150 meters from the border crossing.The delightful seating is in the garden at the rear.The mixed platter for two is highly recommended.Excellent value and friendly service.If you have crossed from the Turkish side the Greek time is - 1 Hour.Enjoy.....",To Anamma
50,We went to this restaurant and I was surprised by the cheap but great food. I would say for this location not overly touristy. Restrooms were very clean and service did understand the needs of a vegetarien and was helpful and friendly.,To Anamma
50,"Typical Greek food. Pork or chiken skewers with fried potatoes and yogurt sauce/salad. There is a nice garden, so prefer to seat there as on the other side there is the pedestrian street where too much peope are passing by and the noise is too loud.",To Anamma
50,"Great time with friends! Tasty food, well cooked meat, delicious starters and potatos! Friendly people! üòÑ Negative: no playground for kids",To Anamma
30,"In a prime location of one of the liveliest pedestrian streets in Nicosia, this locale seems to be struggling to find a niche in their recipes, but not quite there yet. I have to be fair in saying that I've noticed several changes over time toward the better, but overall, the quality of the food recipes lacks authenticity. Still, some meals are better than others, while salads need more attention to freshness (and taste).The cosy and welcoming inner courtyard (covered) is far better than the front facade which resembles a fast food Kebab shop (maybe that's on purpose, I don't know...), and that's the reason I have passed it up for so long.The staff are courteous, zealous in their efforts to satisfy (my request for a drink not on the menu was met without a lot of fuss - as coincidence had it that the owner had the same drink for his personal use), and more so, attentive but not overbearing.Prices are decent enough (by comparison to many other similar places), but in respect to the above, I'd be happy to pay less.I wouldn't mind to go again as I especially like the inner yard, and I hope that this place will pick up.",To Anamma
20,"The food was tasteless. Potatoes were so oily that they stuck into one huge ball. I pressed the ball with a spoon (I was too disgusted to touch it with my own hands) and I must have gathered at least one shot of oil. They do not pay attention to the quality of the food. Oily, non- chewable, tasteless, average food.We were 6 people in total and 5 of us left being hungry since we couldn't eat this hideous food (pitta). The other one ordered a platter which was in a better state than the rest of the food. The tomatoes though, were sick. Being a Biologist myself I could see clearly the damage that germs caused to the tomato.I would not recommend it for people that like good food and want to get what they pay for. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I really liked the place (the garden at the back) very much. These are the reason I am rating 2/5 and not 1/5. If you could just change your cook, upgrade your plates and choices and it would be amazing.Won't be going anytime soon.",To Anamma
50,"We organized a surprise there :) :) It was just wonderful :) the way they served the Food really impressed me , the service was great. I am advising to find a table in their beautiful back yard",To Anamma
50,"The food is delicious, no less than that. It is simple and tasty as we know it from Greek and Cypriot cuisine. They have a special local type brandy called Zivania. If you drink, don't miss it. The service is excellent (whatever people usually mean by that), the staff is friendly. It is a local tavern, you'd not see tourists or foreigners.",To Anamma
40,"Good food, friendly service (mostly), and you can get coffee from the place over the road. They have a cute space at the back, but like most places in Cyprus, allow everyone to smoke (even though it is technically closed in for winter), so we always sit outside at the front. Well priced, fast service.",To Anamma
40,"Nice, cosy old fashion look of the back yard. Nice meet meze!!excellent service! But... the chips served are not good at all.... rounded and thin sliced turning from boiling mostly brown , very unhealthy...",To Anamma
20,"I know what true Greek food taste like. Therefore, I wanted to try nothing else but Greek food when I arrived at Cyprus and I walked passing many other food places to locate this place.Their platters looked really good and were eye catching. The person who showed me the place to sit just gave me a seat in the passage and it was f**ing cold there. There wasn't any heater nearby, especially in this winter. By the tables outside, there were heaters but this person didn't walk me there since he probably wanted to save some seats for others with bigger groups. Even the seat which I was offered was too dirty and the plate they placed in front of me wasn't washed. So I decided to take the food away rather than having it there. There were many people came after me and I saw them even had partially finished their meals, and I had to stay there almost freezing with the wind that comes in. I usually don't walk away from places as it can make people hurt. So I stayed wishing at least the food to be better. My dish was an EUR 8.50 one which was supposed to have essentially two Kebabs, 1 Souvlakia and Pita Bread (other stuff I can't remember). It was a huge pack of food. When I opened it at the hotel room, I found a few pieces of some sausage hidden in kind of a sour sauce, some pita bread and lots of potato chips, gherkin and tomato pieces. Hmmm... that's Greek food? Probably, I never knew what Greek kebab is... and these are the real ones; I don't know. I am having a hard time figuring out which part of it was 2 kebabs and which one was the Souvlakia. Whatever those were, as a count it should have had 3 meaty pieces... but I only found 2 sausage kinda stuff (very little). Maybe those were the ones they call Kebabs and that sour sauce suppose to be what they call ""Souvlakia"".This is bad guys! I am not gonna try Greek food ever in Cyprus! Because many people apparently have rated this place well. That made me wondering whether I had mistaken Greek food for some other good food which I have had before. When I was in the USA I went to a Greek food (franchise) place called Zoe's kitchen. That's the Kebab which makes you never ever forget the word 'Kebab'! They do not stuff the package with junk like potato chips, rather they had nicely done Kebabs with huge meaty pieces, good salad with olives, and sides with greek style rice and pita bread with hummus etc.Staying in that cold for more than 30 minutes, ""To Anamma"" gave me no reason to recommend or visit that place ever again. I didn't rate that place as 'Terrible' because there was a person who talked to me nicely with a view to making me feel better since he knew that I had to stay in the cold for an unreasonable amount of time.",To Anamma
40,Delicious greek food souvlakia and potates. Excelent environment and friendly servise. Reservation recommended always. You can full with the food.,To Anamma
40,"very tasty traditional cyprus food , very nice place family place with nice music and very nice meze!",To Anamma
50,Very good Slovakian that included fries in the sandwich. Very good value for the price. Well located on the Main Street. We ate in the fast food section for a quick lunch while visiting the city.,To Anamma
30,"A very nice place in Nicosia old city.Tasty food in good prices.The day we went service (at least towards us) was not good. Sat on a table and order salad 2 cold dips and a plate. Salad came with drinks within 5 minutes. Kebab plate came after 40 minutes and other tables that came after us, were already eating their order. They forgot the dips and I had to remind them twice.Overall it was ok.",To Anamma
50,The main entrance doesn't give it justice. The food is out of this world! Definetly coming here again!,To Anamma
50,Delicious food! Fresh ingredients at excellent prices. The souvlaki was really tender and I really enjoyed the ledra salad with carob dressing and the courgette and fetta balls. We will definitely visit again.,To Anamma
40,"Very good and fast service! They were very polite! The food was really taste! The price was good! If someone wants to try greek or cypriot food ""Annama"" is a good choice!",To Anamma
40,Situated in the famous pedestrian zone of Nicosia. In the back of the restaurant is a very nice coutyard to dine in. The staff was friendly and we felt welcomme at alI times. I can reccomend the variety A for two persons and the baked feta with tomatoes and peppers. Perfect value for your money and a nice dinner location.,To Anamma
50,"Weekends can get very busy here. If you choose to sit, go inside and seek a table in the inner garden. Hopefully it won't be too busy (and noisy). The souvlaki is indeed the MAIN dish here (choose your preference of Pork/Chicken) . Also, a nice side is the greek style fries. Very nice cooked food. VERY reasonable prices.",To Anamma
50,"This is my second visit, on a very busy sunday where any establishment can be put to the ultimate stress test, to my delight everything was smooth and the grills were fantastic the prices will satisfy you too as for the friendly service it is soothing, look it up when in nicosia, a small nice restaurant that will put a smile on your face...",To Anamma
50,"Walking down the crowded Ledra Street, this is a truly surprising place.Check you the indoor garden/ yard where you can enjoy great food and an ice-cold beerThe service is outstanding and very fast and the overall atmosphere is very friendly. Their BBQ' are great and considering the location it's good value for money.",To Anamma
40,Great food and great friendly service Visited several times and never disappointed for lunch or dinner,To Anamma
40,"If you are in Ledras and you would like to taste traditional Greek souvlaki, this tavern is an excellent choice. Tasty food in big portions, with traditional tastes of tzatziki and onions. Try the mix grill options. The stuff was friendly and gentle. Even the toilets were very clean. And the prices very reasonable. Absolutely reccomended for a quick meal.",To Anamma
50,"IMHO, best kebab in Nicosia. Excellent location, prices are not high, portions big enough. I would recommend it to people visiting Nicosia.",To Anamma
30,"A nice restaurant to dine, has a nice back yard, with some solo live music most days of the week. Food is ok, not very special. Some portions are small and will not satisfy, recomended to try the meat platter rather than single kebab portion. Prices are ok, not the cheapest for the portions given.",To Anamma
50,"It is a small restaurant at the ledra in nicosia not so impressive fa√ßade a small garden tucked away behind but to my astonishment after agreeing with my wife to try it, delicious is the food, from the mix small dishes of tahini fetta kefalotiri tzatziki ... to the lamb and chicken kebab where the meat melts in your mouth delicately seasoned and the marinated lamb ribs are a joy not forgetting the greek vegan keftedes all was great generosity and good prices will make you more than happy that you visited this restaurant, you will definitely enjoy...",To Anamma
40,"A nice place with a back garden and live solo music. Food was ok, nothing special but good. The food seemed not to have any salt at all. It is kinda cheap. Would go again.",To Anamma
40,"Seek out this restaurant and don't walk past. The frontage is on Ledras Street, you'll see white tables and chairs outside, opposite a dessert restaurant. But the gem is the garden area at the back, so walk through the restaurant and eat outside, it's lovely.The food is delicious, my husband had mixed meat in a pitta with salad and fried potatoes and I had marinated chicken with a mustard sauce. My only complaint is that there were far too many fried potatoes which were lovely resulting in me eating too many!!The food is very reasonable priced and you also get a complimentary dessert. Delicious.",To Anamma
40,"Big portions of tasty Cypriot and Greek food for very reasonable prices. Service is great, they really look after you, especially the manager who speaks excellent English (think he lived in the UK for a while). Will visit again for sure.",To Anamma
50,"We were there last night. Pros: Great food (souvlaki, pork chops, lamb chops), we paid 105 euros for 10 people. Service was really good, friendly people. Cons: It was too hot and there was just one AC, making no difference.",To Anamma
50,"A very nice place in old Nicosia, with a beautiful back yard, good food and excellent service at reasonable prices. Should do more for cooling and fresh air during summer hot and humid nights (and days).",To Anamma
30,"This is a very decent place to have good souvlaki and grilled dishes in the capital. Greek and Cypriot cuisine everything is nicely cooked. It doesn't stand out though! I can understand why a tourist would love it but locals get the exact same taste, presentation and menu anywhere, even in their neighbourhood. Cute garden!",To Anamma
50,"We have visited this restaurant many many times but now decided to write a review for a couple of reasons. I ordered souvlaki mix with seftalia in cypriot pitta and my wife ordered the Anamma salad with 3 different ""kalamakia"". Pork and lamb souvlaki and kebab. The salad as always is very fresh and the quality of the meat is always perfect. Very fresh, tasty and delicious in reasonable prices!! ‚Ç¨6.90 for a pitta full of souvlaki seftalia hand made fries and salad is great. The waiters are always so polite trying to satisfy the customers which for me is the second ""strong paper"" of the restaurant. Everybody will say hi and thanks for coming when leaving. I forgot the beers!! Very very cold as all the Cypriots like which comes with cold glass if order bottle. Congratulations to everyone there!!!",To Anamma
10,"I have visited the restaurant many times. The back garden is a nice place, portions are huge and prices are low. The first few times I was not impressed. Food was OK - nothing special though. About a month ago I went back again and the food was horrible. Made me sick. I gave it another chance though, today it was even worse. 7 hours after dinner and my stomach is still hurting. On top of that, service is quite poor as well. Waiters are rude - I've witnessed problems with other tables while being at the restaurant more than once, and I've had food I hadn't ordered or received added to my bill a few times. Tonight we asked for a table, they were taking too long to clean up and then gave it to another group of 6 people, so we had to seat ourselves elsewhere.Restaurant is always full of people and short of staff.Quite a nice atmosphere but the food quality is absolutely disgusting and the service is terrible.As a local, I could name many places with better food quality and better prices.Definitely not visiting again.",To Anamma
30,I visit anamma restaurant at a Sunday night with my family for my coz birthday. We were 14 persons and they gave us a table at the alley next to the place as it was packed on that day. We order for platters to be placed in the middle of the table for all. We order a quite lot of food but according to the waiter it was few for all of us. We decided not to order more and at the end we had half of the food leftovers. In general the service was quick but it could be more polite. The place looked lovely even if we didn't sit inside. The food was average it could be tons better..,To Anamma
50,"As we sat in the beautifully decorated backyard garden, there was a guitar player/singer who accompanied our dinner with calm Cypriot music. Being aware that we are at a grill restaurant, we were prepared to have a rather limited vegetarian selection. However, there are two vegetarian grill options (mushrooms and halloumi-tomato pita) as well as a great variety of vegetarian side dishes and appetizers. All tasted very well (wonderful courgette balls!). Staff was very kind. Excellent value for money.",To Anamma
40,"Again, portions portions portions!! The food is devine and the portions are huge! Servers are friendly and helpful.",To Anamma
30,"Frankly, it is hard to tell one place from another in Nicosia, because the places are either full or empty. Everyone who is local eats between 2130-2200 and the only ones eating earlier are tourists/foreigners or those locals with children. Still walking about, it seems like feast or famine for the restauranteurs. They're either completely full or empty, none with just a few people and people would rather wait at a completely full place than sit at one that is empty but could be seated immediately. Hard to understand but that's why we visit different places and see this sort of behavior or characteristic first hand.",To Anamma
40,The foods were delicious. The prices were normal. Try the seftalia with the traditional pita. And drink the local beer called KEO,To Anamma
10,The service was absolutely horrible. The food took way too time to cook and the waiters were rude. The place was too hot. the food was tasteless. I do not recommend this restaurant.,To Anamma
50,"This place is amazing. Every time i go to Ledras Street, I went there to eat original souvlaki! The menu is very simple and it works amazingly. The ingredients are extremely fresh and local as far as possible. If you are looking for the best souvlaki in Nicosia, to ANAMMA is the right place!",To Anamma
50,"Pork grilled in kebab or shish is unbeatable! Then you have choice three places to eat it, served by the most enthusiastic and friendly staff. The garden is especially lovable. Try the saganaki and roast pork, too. We'll be back.",To Anamma
30,I have been there with my family for lunch. We ate pork chops and pork souvlaki. The food it was ok and the price reasonable. (tip Prefer to sit at the garden),To Anamma
40,We saw quite a few locals dining in this restaurant and decided that was a good sign. We both had the chicken pitta with fries and it was delicious! Very highly recommended. Service was excellent and the small garden at the back is lovely!,To Anamma
50,"Unpretentious, and delicious! Great, authentic Greek and Cypriot food with friendly service too. I'll be back when I'm in town again! Just try variety for two! pork chops, marinated chicken, grilled halloumi, greek pita, fries, tzatziki, salad, tomatoes and peppers, , only ‚Ç¨18! Amazing!",To Anamma
10,"I have visited the place three times ! I was not impressed on the first time ,the food was just ok ,nothing special.the second time was not bad especially the pork souvlaki was good !The back garden yard was nice spending time with friends .The third time was the worst and there is no way i will visit this restaurant again!!Bad service because of too much work and the food was unbielievable!worst souvlaki ever in a tasteless pitta stuffed with potatoes!!!!",To Anamma
50,"Have visited the place once more for a lunch break, had a mix kebab pitta. Everything was great and if you feel like it across the shop the sell excellent ice cream.",To Anamma
50,Fresh and really tasty Cypriat grilled for! Enjoy the platter for 2 variation! Service is prompt without being overbearing! The atmosphere is electric!,To Anamma
50,"What can i say! The food is very nice! Reasonably priced and great value for the money!!! Enjoy a souvlakia/Kebab, the shared platter was also very nice, salad and potato chips. Most enjoyable! After your meal they give each you a small piece of their traditional cakes complementary! they are delicious! Don't be deceived by sitting on the foot path of Lydra street! As there is a lovely garden out the back if you prefer to eat there, you just walk past the kitchen and into the garden. Some evenings they have a guy playing the Guitar it's nice and relaxing! There are 2 private dining rooms at the back of the garden, for a private dinner! I've eaten there several time last summer and in January this year!! I'll definitely go back there to eat again and again! I recommend you try it!",To Anamma
50,"Tasty cheap grilled meat, fresh salads, fresh potatoes and platters, too. Nice inside environment with a garden. I recommend it.",To Anamma
50,"If you enjoy Greek food, salads and oven clay cooked food that tastes delicious at reasonable prices then this is the place. You can see the chef cooking the food and see the food stored in a large fridge, all looks really fresh. Found towards the end of Ledra street this restaurant has a garden at the back set with tables that offers more comfortable surroundings to enjoy your meal. Try it once and I am sure you will return. The service is good too.",To Anamma
20,"Where to start.Ordered a greek souvlaki and what do I get...an almost-burnt pitta bread with two sticks of chicken souvlaki just thrown in there and one thinly-sliced piece of tomato.The fries were overdone and dry, the service was delayed as well as poor (I was charged twice for the pitta apparently because of miscommunication between the staff; a mistake which I pointed out).I even gave this restaurant a second chance, only to be disappointed in exactly the same way. At first sight this restaurant seems to be inexpensive, however the quality AND quantity of the food does not even match the price.The only good thing about this restaurant is its location at the centre of Nicosia in a street where many people go to for leisure and dining. This is the only reason I did not rate it with one star.No restaurant in the world deserves credit if it doesn't make at a minimum a decent effort in preparing its food.",To Anamma
40,"Walking down Ledra street you see this kebab/tavern joint which doesn't look like much. But getting inside and walking through the kitchen area and into the back, you find yourself in a small back yard which feels like walking into another era. The atmosphere is great, the service very good and the chicken kebab very tasty and price very reasonable. My only problem is that tables are set so close too each other that there is virtually no privacy while enjoying a nice dinner. This is not the best kebab house in Nicosia but I would recommend it cause it offers value for money.",To Anamma
40,"Don't be fooled by bland exterior, just walk through the restaurant to the back garden and you will find yourself in wonderful (and heated - very important as today was 3'c) garden.The food was very good- very meat oriented menu, as usual for Greek grill restaurants. Prices reasonable, portions HUGE (come hungry!). Seems very popular with locals, so I assume it's consistently good. Shefkalia (homemade sausage) was a stand out. Ps. For vegetarians out there, Ledra salad was especially delicious with carob dressing and dried fruits.",To Anamma
50,"I visited last September with my family. Excellent food, traditional plates and very nice stuff. Prices were also good and the portions of food make you full quickly :) My favourite plate was the marinated chicken. We will definitely visit this place again next time.If you want to taste great Greek and Cypriot cuisine,come to ""Anamma"" you will be always welcomed there.",To Anamma
50,"Walking in doesn't look like much, in fact we were a little disappointed as it looks like any other kebab house. Walking in the back it's a different story. Beautiful back yard, very good music, specially at night with the lights it's amazing. We were seated without wait in a small room at the back of the garden, bit small but cozy. It's always a little difficult ordering at a restaurant because we have 2 kids, 10 and 7. The menu choices made it easy for us, we started with the appetizer variety for 2 with a Greek traditional salad and for main the Variety for 2 platter with fried courgette balls. Paid 35 EUR with Large beer, Big bottle of water and a soft drinks. It was an amazing experience and after a nice walk at Ledras it was the best choice.",To Anamma
40,"Anamma delivers consistency and quality food. Combine this with great setting in the back yard, friendly staff, and quality greek music on weekdays that is why Anamma has great value for money to visitors and locals alike.",To Anamma
30,"Nice atmosphere in the backyard, but the service was very bad. We asked three times for a table and we almost had to find it ourselves. The food was not so good at all for the price - you can find much tastier kebabs in much better prices. And last thing, we asked why there was some food missing from our platter and they said that they have taken them out of the set menu. And when we said that they were included in the menus they gave to us, they said that the menus were old! Not an acceptable answer.",To Anamma
40,"I have visited this restaurant 2 or 3 times and the quality of the food has not changed. We had the meat platter for two, which is enough food for two hungry people. The staff is ok and the prices are attractive. The best of all is the beck yard. It is like a small Eden in the old town of Nicosia.",To Anamma
30,"The whole atmosphere and the nice location in Ledras street close to the Turkish side, is really inspiring. The ''secret'' garden is romantic and takes you to another time in Cyprus history. The staff is friendly, polite and helpful. Now about the rest. The prices are not bad, but they are bad in connection with what you get. Potatoes are awful, maybe fried for two times. Bread is dry. Meat not the greatest (and it wasn't only my order, i checked what the rest of the company in the table got). There are places where you eat better Greek souvlaki for less money. Good atmosphere wasted. They can get a lot better.",To Anamma
50,From the outside this looks like an ordinary take away kebab house. We were surprised as we walked through the restaurant to discover its beautiful secret garden!we ordered a platter of kebabs which was great. We also enjoyed the courgette and fetta balls . The ingredients are really fresh and the meats taste really good. Price was really reasonable too. We will definitely revisit!,To Anamma
30,"I visited the restaurant for dinner with my husband. Food was ok, but not everything was perfect and some things were left uneaten. It is quite cheap. Atmosphere is ok, again nothing special. Will probably not be returning.",To Anamma
40,"Very well situated at the heart of Ledra street, tables outside + at the back yard. Well trained waiters and cooks, very polite, nice atmosphere, very good food, mainly grilled pork, chicken and sausages. Very good wine. Value for money.",To Anamma
50,"I liked the Pita with chicken ,veggies and fries,excellent. The service was good . The cost was resonable",To Anamma
40,"Central location (Ledra Street)A traditional tavern. Come here for sheftalia or souvlaki.The Service is ok, the food is average and kebab is always the cheap alternative.Starters are between ‚Ç¨2 - ‚Ç¨4, while Salads rank from ‚Ç¨4 to ‚Ç¨5.20.Portions are satisfying. Try the local wine.The staff is friendly.It is open from midday till midnight and offers take away and Delivery service.",To Anamma
50,"Stumbled on this place by accident and so glad we did. Our waiter, was so friendly and helpful. Suggested the variety plate for 2 and it was excellent. The variety of meats and the potatos are fantastic. The local wine was great too and all for a good price.",To Anamma
40,"I'm not a big meat eater, yet I love this souvlaki, even with all the salt on top (hey, that's traditional Greek souvlaki for you). The potatoes are excellent too. I've seen other people say they weren't pleased with the service, but we haven't had issues with it. the best part of it is the price though, as it's quite cheap considering the food it offers.",To Anamma
40,first we have to refer to the street and the feeling that you get when you reach border crossing.So after the sock you need something to refill lost energy.Big portions in fare prices but very tastefull. souvlaki seems to be handmade. potatoes also dry and not full of oil. for family saturday night should be a nice time.,To Anamma
10,"Went yesterday, very rude employees, bad service and the food is very poor quality. Very disappointed of the restaurant... Went too times, both times had issues with the food. Furthermore, the menu is very confusing and got charged extra because of the confusion. Food names on menu not representing the food or the quantity or the quality... e.g. Poikilia is not the correct food title for souvlaki pork and sheftalies.Never going there again, that is for sure",To Anamma
20,"Nothing special... The food is ok, not bad not special... The ntakosalata was not nice though... The tomatoes were like tomatopuree and without onion... even the souvlakia in pita are not so nice... The inside place looks dirty... They have nice back yard but there they allow smoking... So we sat in a small place at the back yard where it had a very strainge smell and the seats were dirty...",To Anamma
40,"Good food, good service, good atmosphere, reasonable prices. Generous servings. Lots of families. The special was goat from the outdoor oven and it was great.",To Anamma
50,"Frontage in Ledra Street looks like a fast food bar, only a photo of the rear restaurant & court yard gives a little hint of what's behind.Food was excellent real value for money with great service & staff, one to be recommended.",To Anamma
40,"Delicious souvlaki!! We have ordered variety for 2 and we were not able to eat everything, Portion was huge :-) Low prices.",To Anamma
30,"We visited this restaurant with friends.The food was nothing special,pork souvlaki much better than chicken.",To Anamma
50,"We visited the place with another couple that had already tried it before and had a good impression..although we were skeptical at first we were sitted in the alley called ""stoa"" in Greek at the side of the place..The front seems like a small place but has enough space at the back..service was quick, friendly waiters, good quality of food and in my opinion fare enough prices..to try everything I would recommend to order a mix platter..is located at your right hand about 150 m before you reach Ledras checkpoint in the pedestrian road of Ledras in Nicosia..recommended for local and tourist as well..hope it won't change during time..",To Anamma
40,It was a cold windy day and I was super nervous about sitting outside. The table we were offered was under a heat lamp and the courtyard was covered. The decor was great and cozy. Our waiter was amazing. His recommendation was spot on and he was super helpful with suggestions of what to do in the area. Food was great. If was a perfect lunch.,To Anamma
50,"Visited the site ""accidentally"", because front view looks like ""kebap only"", but deeper in the restaurant there was a really nice place to sit and listen to live music. A lot of local people were here, so we expected it to be a good choice. The food was excellent, also a fine variety for vegetarians. The staff was very friendly and often asked us, if we need something, it was also fun to make the one or other joke when we left and together lough about it. The stairs to the toilet might be comparably steep if one is drunk, but a proper challenge if you are sober. So in total very recommendable and nice site!",To Anamma
40,"Great location (on Ledras str) with good tasty souvlaki.You can either seat right on the busy street of Ledras or you can seat in their inside ""garden"" area which is just perfect if you want to enjoy your meal in a more relaxing environment.Food is nice and staff is very friendly.",To Anamma
50,It was very nice the decor as also the food! And most important location and price!! We paid for 2 persons including our non alcoholic drinks less than 20 euros!!,To Anamma
40,"Despite the impression you get while passing by as a fast food place you haven't seen all. There is an enclosed backyard, a beautifully arranged place that changes completely your idea from what you see in the street. It's like passing from a fast food area (which is what faces the Ledras street) to a taverna/restaurant area. I have been twice there and the first time we were seated at this backyard. Second time we had a table at the archway which it's not as good as at the backyard. At the archway you feel like you are put aside.Food is mainly kebab and gyros and all these greek style grills.It's guaranteed that you will leave satisfied and full with something good. In any case it's your eat-and-go place so if you want a restaurant to go and spend more time then maybe this is not your place. If though, you want something quick and tasty try it with no hesitation! Low prices and good portions.",To Anamma
40,"Grilled meats, kebabs, salads and wood oven baked pork shank (I think it was one of the best pork shanks I ever tried).Although the food is cheap they have a poor and expensive wibe list.Try to choose a table at the backyard.",To Anamma
40,"Right in the center of Ledras street, It features a back garden, totally recommend it. Food is good. Don't expect a fancy interior. A good choice of local cuisine if you are downtown.",To Anamma

40,"We had a table in Ledra street, not in the garden. We ordered the plate for two for 15 euro, and pay extra for drinks. Food was tasty, well-done and more than enough. Has a variety of meat (pork kebab, chicken kebab, sheftalies) , fried potatos, grilled vegies, tzanziki, salad and pitta bread.Salad was not freshly cut, service was great and was value of money. This restaurant is similar to Piatsa Gourounaki at Phaneromeni , which is more in my taste.",To Anamma
50,"We went with a group of friends there were 6 of us, and ordered three platters for two. The food choices are amazing and they have the tastiest salads and of course not forgetting the Retzina wine and Ouzo. We sat in the magical secret garden at the back of the restaurant and all had an excellent time. The service was good and staff friendly. I would recommend it to anyone and it really is one of the best restaurants in Ledra Street.",To Anamma

Mostly to get a quick Souvlaki on a stick (‚Ç¨1) or a Pita Bread with Souvlaki, Hand chopped potatoes, Tzatziki and tomato (‚Ç¨2), but also for diner in the garden at the back of the restaurant. For ‚Ç¨15 you have a plate for 2 persons, with Every kind of meat (Pork/Chicken/Kebab), potatoes, Bread And salad! Every part of the dishes taste very fresh, The people are friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed.",To Anamma
50,"We stumbled on this restaurant while wandering in the old town in Lefkosia (Nicosia). On first glance, it looks like a small cafe but in the back we discovered a lovely courtyard that also has other cosy rooms with tables. We ate in the courtyard. The place was full of local couples and families, resulting in a lovely atmosphere. The service is great, food amazing and excellent value for money. We had local beers to accompany our platter for two (which we couldn't quite fiinish - and we're big eaters!). The whole bill came to just over 22 euros. Definitely recommended!",To Anamma
50,"It looks like a takeaway shop from the outside, at the top of Ledra street, but inside it has a gorgeous garden, and tasty Greek and Cypriot food, the Anamma salad is really tasty and their kolokithokeftedes, which are corgette balls with feta cheese are a must, as well as their platters and dips. Excellent food, quick service and really good value in the heart of Ledra Street, in the old town, I would recommend it to anyone passing through.",To Anamma
