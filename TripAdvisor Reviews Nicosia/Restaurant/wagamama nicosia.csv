40,"Fresh and delicious sushi . It was very tasty and fresh food. We ordered sushi, asian beer, chicken teriyaki and duck rice bowl. The staff was very kind. The restaurant itself clean.",wagamama nicosia
20,Disappointing. If you like this place... you probably never left Nicosia. Sushi rather sad... cold inside and probably made long before. Pad thai ok though. Don’t even get me started on the staff... some true drones in action there!,wagamama nicosia
30,"Wagamama is an internationally based Japanese fusion restaurant which serves good food, but pretty expensive. This place always has reservation problems and is treated as fancier than it actually is",wagamama nicosia
10,We had it delivered. Very low quality of food and way overpriced! The grilled duck ramen had barely any duck inside and the duck wraps were awful. The only thing we consumed were the edamame.,wagamama nicosia
50,"If you into Asian cousin you like this place. There is something for every test. Food is good, friendly staff and nice atmospheric.",wagamama nicosia
30,The menu is diverse and has options for most tastes.The service is often reliable and friendly. The salad selection is not too diverse though and the salmon is prepared in a way that is not to my liking.Sushi is passable and alright for a chain restaurant.,wagamama nicosia
50,"We go there 2-3 ti,es a month. Good food, great service. And you always have some thing good to chose from.",wagamama nicosia
40,"The restaurant is in a good location. Staff is friendly. Unfortunately they don’t have Miso soup at all! Almost for a year! I was disappointed, as I came specially to have this soup as a part of my meal. I end up taken a big ramen dish, what I couldn’t finish in two days. Food is fresh and tasty.",wagamama nicosia
40,"We had sushi, 2 different curries and a pad thai. The pad thai was a miss (bland) but the rest was nice and the staff friendly. Being adked why I did not finish my pad thai, I answered it wasn't to my taste. Upon receiving the bill, the waitress let us know my dish hadn't been counted for as it did not meet my expectations. That's a first and definitely a good point for them.",wagamama nicosia
30,"We go there very often! We love wagamama food. However so many times they made mistakes with our vegan orders and after waiting we eventually received other plates. This also happened with delivery three times! So foos is amazing but make sure you repeat your order twice!!!! This goes strictly for the shop at Themistokli Dervi! All others are excellent! (Mall of cyprus, paphos, larnaca)!!!",wagamama nicosia
40,"This is a well known Nicosia restaurant with variety of dishes mainly from southeastern Asia and Japan. The dishes are well-served and tasty. The environment is casual but nice. The staff is competent despite the rush. Both me and my family including kids enjoy dining there. Nevertheless, the prices for this kind of restaurant could have been better.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Loved the service! And a shout out to the best waitress Eleni! She was on the top of her game! Great night out, great food! Really happy.",wagamama nicosia
50,"""Wagamama"" is an all-time favourite chain of restaurants around the country and it is always enjoyable to visit both with friends and family. I would strongly recommend the grilled duck ramen, the chicken & shrimp cha-han donburi, any type of gyoza and the salmon & avocado salad. For vegeterians, vegatsu (vegan katsu curry) is great.",wagamama nicosia
50,"This is a great chain, you pretty much know what you’re going to get. However this trip we had a server named Maria, and she was awesome. Very attentive and fast.",wagamama nicosia
30,We order from wagamama regurarly. Sushi is fresh and food is always consistently decent. Take away takes a long time about 40 mins to an hour.,wagamama nicosia
40,I went to wagamama twice. Fresh sushi and very nice soups. Service was fast but the portions were small. Quality was great though. Prices are good.,wagamama nicosia
40,Took my guests from abroad here for a dinner. Quite nice place with good food and service. Will definitely come back.,wagamama nicosia
10,"I’ve been going to wagamama Nicosia for a long time and always had the impression that the waiters were a bit rude but I would still continue to go because I liked the food. But today the waitress almost had a fight with my girlfriend who asked her in a nice way something about the bill, by talking to her in an aggressive way, and on top of that the sushi was terrible. I understand that the job of a waiter is difficult as I have worked as a waiter for 7 years, but this is unacceptable, especially in a Thursday afternoon with ONE TABLE IN THE WHOLE RESTAURANT. Seems like some of your staff need to work on their behavior. It’s a shame because the guy who gave us our table (the manager I suppose) was very polite and helpful.",wagamama nicosia
40,I have been there and order food from it a few times always satisfied with the food and service. A big variety of dishes all of them tasty and good portions.,wagamama nicosia
40,have been there a few times always satisfied from the food and service. A big variety of dishes all of them tatesty and good portions,wagamama nicosia
50,"Amazing healthy food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere, decent prices (drinks and deserts a bit expensive, main courses ok). My favourite dishes are the tuna and salmon. From starters the chilly squid. From sushi the popcorn prawn roll. Highly recommended!",wagamama nicosia
50,"Wagamamas ist nice because apart from their ever changing menu, their ingredients are fresh, their food tastes good and they are very child friendly (both in good options and setting).Their edemame is always exquisite, as are their dumplings. Their noodle dishes as well as curry dishes are also very tasty and never dissappoint. My personal favourites include the seafood coconut soup, salmon soba noodles and their sushi.This is a place I often revisit.Would highly recommend, especially if you're looking for a family friendly restaurant, but not only.",wagamama nicosia
50,I cannot decide what i love more wagamama food or their service thanks natasha for making wagamama worth while,wagamama nicosia
50,Good food and excellent service love the sushi everything comes on time. All waitresses were very helpful especially the manager who is very friendly and great with kids,wagamama nicosia
50,A standard place for us for usual dining. The food is great comparing to prise and the the manager Natasha knows her job well.,wagamama nicosia
10,"Been going for years. Used to be the usual nice wagamama tastes with truly excellent service. Seems for sone reason their staff changed and now the service is truly terrible. No smiles, borderline aggressive and making us feel uncomfortable to ask for service. Remember? Service? Half the job of a waiter? Manager needs to get their act together.",wagamama nicosia
50,"AMAZING! Our order was 30min to 1hr late, so we called them back. Straight away, without questions they apologized, told us that the order would be here at 20min and that we would have a 30% discount at our order.",wagamama nicosia
30,Enjoyable dining and nice food. Strange that they can't seem to serve dishes at the same time. We now will order appetizers before the main meal as we've had the appetizers served after the main course in the past.,wagamama nicosia
50,Best sushi and chinese kitchen meets high class service and menu selections. Still the best since they founded.,wagamama nicosia
50,"Serving nice Japanese food. The menu of around 11 eur is a good idea. We had several menu and share it . THe curry chicken, the ramen chicken and the noodles were tasty in addition to several appetizers. The service was excellent. I like this place",wagamama nicosia
10,"Absolute disappointment.We placed an order at 21:15 and we got a feedback response that we will receive the order at 22:07.We dared to call to ask the status of our order at 22:32 since it was long overdue. It was confirmed by the call center that our order failed to reach the restaurant due to a technical error. We we're assured that we will receive our order in half hour with a discount. ( 35 euros instead of 50).We were surprised when we got a call from the delivery person that presumably he was outside our house door. It seemed though that he was outside a house at an address in Limassol (our house is in Nicosia).When we finally managed to get through the phone of the Nicosia restaurant, we requested to talk to the manager.We ""tried"" to explain that we had been waiting for our order for over 2 hours, with the mere response that there was nothing that she could do.Needless to say that we ended up (ourselves a a friend of ours) with no food on a Sunday evening at 23:20.It came as a huge surprise that the manager's sole response was that ""there was nothing she could do"", hence we ended up searching to find something to eat.It's beyond me that, there was no alternative solution being offered to us by the restaurant.It comes with so say that there no chance whatsoever to order again from this restaurant nor from any other restaurants of the same group.Huge dissappoitemt......",wagamama nicosia
50,"Gabi is the best!!She gave us very good service,iffering us food that she thoght was appropriate for us.Defunately would come again",wagamama nicosia
50,"Wagamama serves healthy food. I really enjoy eating wagamama as they taste really good. It a place where you can go with your other half, family, friends and you will enjoy the food equally! Moreover you can buy food with low and/or average prices!!",wagamama nicosia
50,High Quality food and excellent service. Value for money for sure and 5 🌟 taste. Very friendly environment. Highly recommend for business lunch or dinner also,wagamama nicosia
50,Excellent! Value for money Good service Friendly staff Good quality Fresh food Excellent!! I recommend it !,wagamama nicosia
50,"Quick, delicious, value for money. The service is always excellent, and we come regularly for lunch breaks. The quality is always the same, reliable.",wagamama nicosia
10,Delivery arrived one hour after the order and one of four mains was missing. Had to wait 10 minutes on the line to talk to customer care. Waited another 10 minutes to receive a call back confirming that a new main would be delivered to our house in 20 minutes. Our family dinner turned into installments of eating...Apparently phc customer care felt that this was sufficient resolution to the problem caused by the negligence ....it all went very corporate for this restaurant group for some time now...,wagamama nicosia
50,They had a vegan menu. Sake was warming and the cocktail list was interesting. Surprised to see sushi on the menu. Main dishes were as tasty as the U.K. but portions seemed a bit larger.,wagamama nicosia
50,"Always a nice choice for asian food, although a bit expensive for the portions. Very tasty food in a nice minimal environment.",wagamama nicosia
50,Very good and always satisfied. Service is great. Food is always kept the same. Same layout and presentation as well as taste and ingredients. Good work,wagamama nicosia
50,The best sushi and best service in town I would recommend for romantic lunch or dinner and the chocolate layer is amazing,wagamama nicosia
10,"All restaurants must offer a certain service such as pouring wine in glasses as soon as its almost gone, or at least when asked, while wagamama staff were rude enough to decline our request. It was a Monday evening so refusing this request was unheard of. The grilled duck donburi, was smelly. It reeked of rotten meat.Overall the experience was bad even though we had a nice company.",wagamama nicosia
50,"There is very good place , foods always fresh and so nice and services is perfect..........ı tecomend ıt",wagamama nicosia
40,The service was great. Friendly staff that knows the menu and helps you choose according to your taste buds :) My samla curry tasted exactly like the description!,wagamama nicosia
50,"Very well made food,very organised,lots of things to choose from its just PURFECT for a Friday night with friends!!!!!!",wagamama nicosia
50,"I love Wagamama.The food is so good,I always get the same food.Natasha is my favorite waiter.Nicolas",wagamama nicosia
50,I went to wagamama with a few friends.i didn’t expect much but was surprised to how helpful and friendly the staff were.They explained the dishes very well and even suggested food for me.the squid was lovely and the sushi was just as good.I had noodles with salmon and it was delicious.I will go again for sure.Even the juice I had was great.Thank you to everybody and continue doing such a great job,wagamama nicosia
50,High class service and menu selections. Be ready to wait for a free table if on Saturdays and other busy week days because of the many people who appreciate the quality offered here. I am going again each time I am in Cyprus.,wagamama nicosia
40,"Good place to eat with a good variety to choose from. Open during the day whereas other nearby restaurants are closed, Wagamama is probably the best place to dine-in early evening hours.Family friendly with choices for kids meals, good variety of sushi and nice tasty Asian dishes.",wagamama nicosia
40,My favorite place to eat! Plenty of menu options and the food is always prepared well. Highly suggest for others to eat there.,wagamama nicosia
40,"i love the food there, very good service, clean place, people are polite and helpful, little expensive,",wagamama nicosia
40,"Satisfied in every aspect: well mannered and efficient staff, tasteful and varied food, reasonable prices.",wagamama nicosia
30,"Sushi tastes average to ok, except from the caterpillar and the rainbow maki which taste amazing.They removed the best noodle soup (Shirodashi) from the menu. The remaining noodle soups (even the duck with the rich stock/broth) are not rich enough (lacking dashi, miso and stock/broth complexity/richness). Having said that, noodle soups still taste fine, it's just that they're so close to tasting exceptional.Gyoza is very goodHirata are usually very good but not always: sometimes (40% of orders)1. the buns are not proofed sufficiently (resulting in too flat, too sticky and not airy/fluffy buns)2. The buns are double steamed (cooked and re-warmed) or steamed and kept in too dry of an environment (buns loose airyness and develop leathery skin)3. Stuffing is old (never more than 30 hours though), dry and chewy.We've also had some experiences with uncooked spices in the curries.",wagamama nicosia
30,Wagamama is a good restaurant for a visit but to visit omce and then go back after 5 months. There isn't something that drags you to visit it again. The food is OK but nothing so special. Also there is staff that does not speak greek and it's unacceptable to live and work in Cyprus and not knowing greek. Why should I as a Cypriot in my country speak in English as the staff does not speak Greek.,wagamama nicosia
50,I visited several times this restaurant. The food is always tasty and fresh. The service is good too. I recommend this place,wagamama nicosia
30,Average food with Asian cuisine and most of the dishes having the same taste Clean and with the standard Wagamama design but overpriced,wagamama nicosia
40,"The food here is for the soul! The sushi is always fresh and very tasty, their ramen is excellent and will always be a personal favourite! The starters are also delicious and have good prices. The only thing i would change is the general atmosphere.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Very nice atmosphere for a casual night out with either friends or family. The food is great especially the curry, very tasty and of good quality. The service just as good.",wagamama nicosia
40,"This is not a fast food place, yet it's rather fast. the quantities of food are great - you're never going to leave hungry!the prices are very accessible and the flavors are delicious.the staff is always really friendly and happy to help.if you love asian food - definitely worth a visitthe only annoying thing is that the dishes come at a different time but it's usually just a couple minutes apart - so that's never really a big problem.",wagamama nicosia
10,Quality has deteriorated and most waiterss are rude. Food is very expensive for the quality offered.,wagamama nicosia
50,The sushi is very cheap and very good quality as is the rest of the food. The restaurant is very clean and I would remained it for some one who wants to try oriental food,wagamama nicosia
40,"Noodles are very delicious, but soup is bit plain, price is bit expensive. Waitress is very friendly. I wish the chef can chop the meat into pieces.",wagamama nicosia
40,"We've tried different kinds of ramen and it's been good and nourishing. Also good fresh juices. Prices are not low, rather higher that average.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Ive been coming to this restaurant monthly for the last year . I love their food . Everything they make is so tasty and inviting . The sushi is fresh and well presented . Their Ramen dishes are the best in Cyprus . Service is always great , the staff is friendly and very helpful . Only gripe I have is that it is slightly overpriced .",wagamama nicosia
50,"Quality personal, good food and good prices. Wide choice of meals. Nice interior a calm atmosfere. Easy to find.",wagamama nicosia
30,"Great help from the staff! They know all their dishes and can really help you choose, if you are not aware of this cuisine.My noodles were dry but tasty! We ordered a side dish with fried shrimps... the shrimps were melted badly!Our Cocktails were great! A bit overestimated bill... cause this is actually a fast food option!",wagamama nicosia
20,"Went for the first time last week and was very very disappointed. Was so noisy and felt more like a school canteen or a fast food place rather than a restaurant that is NOT CHEAP AT ALL . Service was ok, no music, no ambience, food cannot comment as only 1 out of 4 of us actually liked what they were eating. Left as soon as possible and went further down. Would not return again.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Noodles are very delicious, bit expensive. Waitress is very friendly. I wish the chef can chop the meat into pieces.",wagamama nicosia
50,"As a visitor to Nicosia wagamama on at least 3 occasions during each of my twice years trips to Cyprus I can say “I’ve not been disappointed yet”.The flavours are Japanese, but probably slightly tweaked to suit a more Western taste. Everything is freshly cooked to order and the wagamama concept is that dishes can arrive randomly as ready. The fillet steak on noodles and the Japanese grilled salmon were delicious. A side of chilli crispy squid with chilli and lime dipping sauce was scrumptious. We especially liked the salted caramel ice cream with sesame seeds and caramel sauce and the coconut reika with passion fruit sauce was rather exotic. Other dessert options are available.The team are great, efficient and happy to chat and advise on the dishes as required. They are encouraged to offer a memorable dining experience even if it a quiet casual style of restaurant.Hygiene and atmosphere are second to none at this restaurant.",wagamama nicosia
50,Very friendly staff..special thanks to Victoria- waitress!!Very helpful and friendly.. The food is very tasty!! We will come again!!,wagamama nicosia
50,"Although I am not an expert in Asian food, in this restaurant I ate an excellent tuna fish with soy and mixed vegetables and a side dish based on duck. To finish, a very good veal steak with soy noodles and a passion fruit sorbet. The cost was a bit higher than expected, but food quantity and quality were high.",wagamama nicosia
30,"The food has improved since our last visit but the curry doesn't have enough kick to it. The staff need a great deal of work, they look and act bored. In fact they were to a point of being rude",wagamama nicosia
10,Food: the worst asian food i evere tasted. Tasteless and pointless. Service : really rude and unpolite. Price: high price for low quality and quantity.,wagamama nicosia
40,Went there as wanted to eat some Asian food and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the foodI ordered the Rendang and some tempura and both were goodThe Tempura was cooked perfect as was the curryGood atmosphere and the staff was polite and helpful with their suggestionsDefinitely will come again when I next visit,wagamama nicosia
50,"I can never get board of Wagamama. there is always something new to discover. and it's great to be able to combine different tastes. the sushi is amazing and I was very pleasantly surprised to find gluten-free noodles on the menu (rice noodles). The service was great also and even though the place was packed, the staff was very pleasant and helpful.",wagamama nicosia
30,"We visited today! Over all atmosphere was great, food was decent! Unfortunately the waitresses came across that they do not enjoy there job and don’t want to be there! Very low in energy, not smiling and the worst basic knowledge of Greek!( including the floor manager that couldn’t speak a word in Greek)Further more the dishes came with a 15’ delay between them! We I raised the issue and requested to speak to the manager they explained to me that some stations in the kitchen are more busy that other! This is not an excuse for 15’ delay of one of the plates! The manager did apologise and offered complimentary desert that made our visit a bit more pleasant!Would I recommend it to others not sure!",wagamama nicosia
40,"Very good food for this kind of kitchen, quick service but very very overpriced for a fast food restaurant.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Tried to find a fusion style restaurant in nicosia. Wagamama was very close to my hotel, in a central collection. We I did not regret at all for choosing it.Great food, atmosphere, and service! Best value for money restaurant of its kind. Will visit again.",wagamama nicosia
40,Food was delicious with ingredients of good quality. Very crowded inside and outside on a Wednesday night. We could hardly find a table. Staff is friendly and polite.,wagamama nicosia
50,My first choice for Asian-fusion food- especially sushi and noodles! Appropriate for a casual lunch or dinner with friends but also for a business meal or a date! Never disappointing on the food quality and pretty good service also with reasonable prices. Highly recommended!,wagamama nicosia
50,This was definitely a change we needed from kebabs. The place was pretty quite with lots of staff. Not our usual place to come on holiday for food but we needed the spice and favour in our life,wagamama nicosia
40,Clean. Bit overcrouded sometimes. Limited options. Good food. Even better sushi. Not cheap but not extremely expensive either.,wagamama nicosia
40,The food was good quality and the spicy tuna roll was very good. The service was quick and friendly. We had a good time.,wagamama nicosia
40,"When you don't know where to go, this is also a good place. Food is consistently good - very good, kids love the place, new varieties on the menu, and is reasonably priced. went there yesterday with 4 kids (10-12), the waitress (Anastasia) who took our order was great, helped kids with all their questions. Have been many times, and always leave satisfied. You can usually have a meal in under an hour if in a rush. Thing they should improve is the timing of the dishes, mains can come first and then starters. Also, all the waiters could look happier",wagamama nicosia
30,For dine in is ok. Asian fusion cuisine mainly noodles. Delivery is poor quality but the dine in is acceptable. For a quick meal is ok.,wagamama nicosia
30,"Service was OK. Polite employees. The atmosphere was fine, even though some things could improve. For example, we were sat outside at the back, where there was no music (as opposed to the rest of the restaurant, which was full); it was very warm so we asked them to switch on the fan, but then asked them to switch it off because it was too noisy and strong (it only had one mode). We went there for sushi. We had a combination of things, so we had sushi, sashimi etc. It was mediocre at best. Next time I want sushi I'll go elsewhere. However, I heard many good things about other dishes, so I might revisit but have something else instead.",wagamama nicosia
40,The best about wagamama is that everything is freshly made and served as soon as it's ready! And love the sushi there!,wagamama nicosia
50,If you need sushi its the place to go. Nice food nice atmosphere very good servers dying to help you. Try everything. A little bit expesive but quality its top.,wagamama nicosia
50,Went there only once but recommend from this experience and Im also planning to go back. My selection from the menu was great (curry) and nice big portion as I was so hungry :) There were other mouthwatering dishes ordered in our table. Nice change to typical tavernas.,wagamama nicosia
20,"Guys you have to find the way to make this place work at last. Food is not bad but the service sucks. I don't know who is responsible for this, the waiters, the chefs or the management, but guys to wait for a sashimi for 20min, no thank you can will stay home and cook. Really you need to do something soon...",wagamama nicosia
40,We like Wagamama in the UK and sometime you want a change from meat and chips and salad - very nice as they are. This is Wagamama's only we were able to sit outside on a warm sunny evening and enjoy it al fresco. It was good. It was Wagamama's. The standards of food and service were upheld well. We enjoyed it.,wagamama nicosia
50,"Excellent service from the staff there, perfect plates when it comes to the quality as well as appearance, the restaurant is very good for people who eat meat as well for vegetarians but you can find some choices if you are a vegan ,by modifying your food order. I recommend the '' Yasai Tofu with Vegetables without Egg"" for those who are vegans and for a starter the ""Edamamme Beans"", if you are a fan of blueberry fruit try as a drink from the menu the ""Blueberry Spice"". Overall, i have to say that is an excellent and comfortable restaurant in Nicosia with a wonderfull atmosphere both inside and outside!!! The price of the food is average not too expensive not too cheap. There is a parking lot near the restaurant if you visit the restaurant by car.",wagamama nicosia
10,We were visited this place for lunch but unfortunately we were very disappointed.Food was completely tasteless and staff were polite but not attentive at all,wagamama nicosia
20,"Feedback to restaurant: Customers don't care about your kitchen process. We order food and we want it the way we order. Not the side dish first, then the drinks then the appetizer and then the main dish?",wagamama nicosia
40,Good choice for an easy dining. The food is very good. Very good atmosphere and in good location. It's in the city center.,wagamama nicosia
20,"Have been here on numerous occasions over the years - since they first opened , and found the standards were consistent and food tasty and fresh .However our past 2 visits have not lived up to the quality that wagamama was.The last time was the worst, scruffy and tired looking venue, pad thai was served with steaming hot noodles but cold hard prawns and tough cold pieces of chicken thrown in .I actually sent it back. Also the coconut broth was not up to par.The staff were all extremely efficient, our disappointment was with the food and ambiance.We won't be returning.",wagamama nicosia
40,Good place for a relaxed evening meal. Ordering is easy and food is good. Good choice on the menu and there something for everyone.,wagamama nicosia
50,Lovely restaurant with a comfy and casual atmosphere and value for money mouthwatering dishes! Friendly staff and a variety of dishes to choose from,wagamama nicosia
40,"We enjoy lunch and dinner at this restaurant regularly. Good food, average prices, not cheap, polite staff.",wagamama nicosia
50,"I usually don't review a place more than once, but I just had to set things right after my last review. We visited Wagamama again on a Sunday to celebrate my daughters birthday. I really liked the new menu; it had lots of new tasty options to try out. The food was excellent. I wish the portions were a bit bigger though. The service was friendly, fast and efficient, even though the place was packed. They were even kind enough to put and light a candle on one of their awesome desserts for my daughter to blow out. Keep it up!!!",wagamama nicosia
50,The atmosphere was great the food excellent and the service quick and very helpful.I would definitely visit again.,wagamama nicosia
40,"The atmosphere of the restaurant was good and comfy, the experience and the food was unique and the service was excellent.

30,"Ok prices, there isn't any decorations or anything, the food is ok, I would go there again but its not something special",wagamama nicosia
50,"Very good service, friendly atmosphere and personnel, with absolutely great food. Value for money. Highly recommended!!!",wagamama nicosia
40,Visited with my family of four with no reservation.Found a table easily.The place is minimal design with kitchen in open space.The food is really nice and fresh amd it worth it to order new disches to try out.We had a nice lunch. Surely a good place to visit.,wagamama nicosia
50,The food is good and the prices are ok. Nice place to visit with your colleagues or kids for a lunch break. Many food options and quick service.,wagamama nicosia
40,"Good quality mainstream asian food, service always impecable, portions are large, and flavours are always up yo standard! Keep up the good work!",wagamama nicosia

50,"After being in the excellent Nemuro, we went twich to Wagamam and enjoyed it! Excellent food and really nice personnel! Specially good for Vegans!",wagamama nicosia
50,Fine and fresh Asian food and sushi. Above expectations service and friendliness. Nice atmosphere. And sensible prices for the whole experience. This is the favourite place of kids. And kids don't lie. We just keep visiting Wagamama for the past two years. And we were never disappointed. A must visit in Nicosia.,wagamama nicosia
30,Being a Wagamama lover from London. This was a little disappointing. The staff was lovely and friendly but my noodles were over cooked and sticky. But I'm gonna give it another chance to see if it was one off.,wagamama nicosia
50,We decided to stay in and order wagamama delivery. We loved the yaki soba and the yakitori duck with pancakes. Excellent quality and prompt delivery.,wagamama nicosia
50,"The food is superb and the service is very friendly & professional. If you are in town, make sure to go and check it out :)",wagamama nicosia
40,"Went for dinner last night. Food and service great but a problem with the timing of my wife's main course. However, Manager Spyros went out of his way to apologise and to make us feel we were valued customers. Thank you Spyros and a huge plaudit to all your staff. We shall return very soon.",wagamama nicosia
40,If you are I interested to eat a different food in Nicosia then this is the place to be . Clean and descent place with different type of seating chairs to suit everyone .,wagamama nicosia
30,"Good tastes but for a fast food place trying to be a reservation restaurant...dont know. The prices are quite high for what they offer and the rustic ""take away feeling"" kinda of place it is. Try it!",wagamama nicosia
50,excellent food! quick and nice service! good quality and quantity of food at good prices!! the best sushi i ever tried! worth to try!,wagamama nicosia
50,The food and service is very good - i will recommend to try number 91 - teriyaki chicken raisu is very delicious - sushi collection is interesting as well,wagamama nicosia
40,"We visit this place often for Sunday lunch because of the tasty food, the quality of the ingredients and the friendly and efficient service. Last Sunday for the very first time the service was disappointing. Without it being more busy than usual, it seemed that some members of the staff were out of place and confused. I hope this was a one off.",wagamama nicosia
50,"I'm not usually a huge fan of sushi, but I am here. I ate here because it was just around the corner from where I was staying and I was feeling lazy, but I ended up going back; the curries are also nice (but be forewarned that they aren't particularly mild). The atmosphere is very contemporary, for better and worse; it's stylish but loud. The service is friendly if a tad slow. The serving sizes are generous.",wagamama nicosia
50,"I visited the restaurant many times for business lunch and enjoyed it.So I decided to take my family for dinner.Food good as always, we had some curry dishes and noodles with lemongrass sauce. Amazing.Even though it was a Saturday night and very busy service was very good.Lively place, a bit noisy but it is worth it.Chicken raisukaree was delicious.",wagamama nicosia
10,"Went there for some great food based on the TripAdvisor Rating and was greeted with a mess.Sushi came literally 3 minutes after ordering (not the way sushi is supposed to be) one roll tasted so FISHY which again should never be the case. Then the edamame arrived (that was the starter) really? Final roll arrived not really sushi in my opinion as it was fried. With all of that--> dining experience was killed (literally) by a half dressed birthday child running around screaming as the Grandmother chased her down. Kid friendly I get but kid ruined not prepared.No pictures because I want to forget this experience.Again could just be me, but WOW.",wagamama nicosia
50,One of the best Asian food spots in Nicosia Excellent service excellent food very polite and kind waiters,wagamama nicosia
50,"Everything was delicious and perfect. We love Wagamama....Each time we come we are served with the staff who is always knowledgeable and qualified. They are eager to serve the customers. If there is anything wrong or misunderstood, they immediatedly try their best to correct it. Wagamama is very clean and fresh so we eat without any hesitation...",wagamama nicosia

40,Great sushis at reasonable prices. The environment was very friendly and the atmosphere pleasant. Quick lunch and service.,wagamama nicosia
40,"This time we visited Wagamama for a quick dinner. I ordered the teriyaki soba with chicken which was great, and my husband had the yakitori duck with pancakes. The maki rolls we ordered were just ok, they could be improved. The banana katsu was nice as well.",wagamama nicosia
50,"One of my favorite restaurants in town. A big variety of dishes, good portions, great environment and friendly staff.",wagamama nicosia

40,"Was my first time there and i enjoyed it very much,food was very tasty and fresh and the desert was delicious . should also open in larnaca",wagamama nicosia
40,A Refreshing Atmosphere in the center of Nicosia with a mix of Asian crispy tasty dishes. Edamame is my favorite!,wagamama nicosia
20,Our dishes for four persons came in 4 doses by the time the dish of one person arrived the other finished his food. The three people finished eating and the dinner of the third person arrived and 15 minutes later the dinner of the third person arrived.Very poor service.,wagamama nicosia
40,"Great value for money. Lots of menu choices, great dishes, quick service and pleasant staff. Excellent place.",wagamama nicosia

30,..and average food quality. It is more like a teen meeting place than a proper restaurant. It is too noisy and most of the staff seem really unhappy to be there. Food extremely salty especially for Asian kitchen.,wagamama nicosia
50,"It was a scorching hot day and we were pleased to sit down.Great service and food served fast, despite being busy.Clean toilets, good English speaking service.Food was a s expected for Wagamamas, very good with interesting drinks menu.All in all Great :-)",wagamama nicosia
50,"excellent service, great food, very helpful staff. I am a frequent customer and always leave the restaurant happy:) Ηas won a Time Out award two years in a row.... I highly recommend",wagamama nicosia
50,I'm a regular diner there. Never failed to disappoint. Great staff and atmosphere. Although it's a little pricy for the quality of food but perhaps it's worth every cent to provide a good standard of service and quality.,wagamama nicosia
40,"Your usual Wagamam, nice food, nice decor and great service. Everything from sushi to salads is great. Should always be in your list if you are looking for a quick lunch/dinner.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Arrived there lunch time on Sunday in the sweltering heat and starved after a long morning coffee session. We were greeted with smiles all round in a very cool air-conditioned environment and asked if we would prefer to be seated in the quieter zone of the restaurant, given we were not with young children in tandem. We gladly took this option and were led upstairs to an indeed more relaxing environment, equally cool and pleasant. We quickly breezed through the menu and made a wide selection of Sushi & Sashimi dishes (inter alia Spicy Tuna, California Maki, Cha Han, Spicy Ebi, Salmon Sashimi, Lollipop Prawns) and a salad (Salmon Sashimi Salad with Avocado) which turned out to be such a marquee choice, superb! The order was processed and within a minute the drinks arrived followed in rapid procession by the food – the pace was indeed appreciated as we were famished. Each thing we savoured was delightful, with distinctive flavour and crisp freshness. Looking at all the food around us we thought eating it all would be a bridge too far, but such was the appreciation that we munched through it, albeit at a faster pace initially but eventually creamed the lot! Mission accomplished and all the right signals from the taste-buds but maybe not from our belts. This was, to say the least, an all-round satisfying meal, be it the cool environment, pleasant service, the food - absolutely the food; it was all there! We appreciate Sushi-Sashimi greatly and have been to most of the fine dining and not so fine dining restaurants of the genre island-wide and can say with absolutely no reservation that Wagamama is up there challenging for distinction in this category and it will definitely be a place we will re-visit time and time again.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Delicious food and juices.good air conditioning,clean and tidy restaurant prices is ok. Japanese grilled salmon is unique.",wagamama nicosia
40,Wagamama is a good restaurant. It offers a variety of japanise dishes. The food is not the best but it's surely not the worst. The service is good and the prices are okay. What I dont like about Wagamama is that they bring dishes at different times on the table so other people can start eating while you are waiting.,wagamama nicosia
30,"Very pleasant restaurant. Good air conditioning on a hot day. Good server and pleasant. Food is nicely prepared. The California rolls were decent. My dumplings were not great, actually overdone. Salad good and the sushi fresh. Pricing is not great. But we will be back. I recommend.",wagamama nicosia
20,"i have been twice in this place trying to understand why many people like it, ambiende and service is good but food is nothing special",wagamama nicosia
30,"The food at wags is always great and one of my favourite cousines, however the upbeat and happy atmosphere that used to exist there a year ago is nowhere to be seen.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Nice restaurant, polite and helpful staff who came and check on us couple times during our dinner. Food was nice and freshly made, i had a salmon salad which it was really good but i will appreciate bigger portion thought. Value for money restaurant",wagamama nicosia
30,The food was excellent as usual. The service was not the best..even though it was very busy that is not an excuse for delays. Also the noise and environment was too loud and made us want to eat and leave straight away. Great fresh juices!!,wagamama nicosia
50,"Very friendly atmosphere, the favorite place for my daughter and she loves the food very much as well as the rest of the family. the sushi platters are excellent as well as the plates. easy access, free parking, excellent location and the staff is just excellent. highly recommended",wagamama nicosia
30,"I've been visiting Wagamama in Nicosia every Friday night for the past 5-6 weeks. The food is pretty good, I am always having the salad with salmon and avocado and sushi. Everytime we are visiting all staff members make us feel like home! However, last week our visit was not so pleasant. The staff seemed very tired and bored and they didn't have their usual smile on their faces!...It wasn't our usual Friday night out at Wagamama. Everything seemed so unorganised... Next Friday we are visiting again though because we really like the food.",wagamama nicosia
30,"Asian food, I didn't like the place, the food was average to good, we tried noodles Free parking in Nicosia. Central location",wagamama nicosia
40,"friendly atmosphere and very friendly waiters , good service and good food. good location , like it for lunch times.",wagamama nicosia
10,"Six family tables for Sunday lunch, 1.5 waitresses. Not the waitresses fault we waited for everything, management is to blame. Poor kids running around like headless chickens! Some examples - 20 minutes to get a bottle of water. Starters without plates and cutlery...that took another 10 minutes.If you come here for a family Sunday lunch do so with a lot of patience.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Wagamama is a great choice for reliable and consistent quality. The selection of dishes is wide and if you are into Asian food, you are guaranteed to find at least a few choices to indulge.The place is clean and not overly noisy, even in the busiest of nights. The staff are professional and friendly, even though the trainees are not always as progressed as perhaps the restaurant management seems to think.Favourite dishes - sushi platters, terriyaki steak soba and the Cha Han.Overall, a great time with our children. Will certainly be going back!",wagamama nicosia
50,"As usual we had a nice meal sitting outside, service was great and smiley. Must have desert :) Thanks",wagamama nicosia
50,"We hadn't been in this restaurant for about a year (but we did ordered delivery) and went there again today and were very pleased. They had changed the menu (adding new dishes) as well their appearance (clothes, menu card and dinnerware set). The food was good as usual and the service was just excellent; pleasant, helpful and polite.",wagamama nicosia
30,"It was my first time at this restaurant and itt did not meet my expectations for the price involved. The service was average, nice balcony to sit outside but everyone smokes there, the dishes were nothing special. That sums up....",wagamama nicosia
50,nice fusion cousin good price excellent service and friendly staff would visit again for all of the above and the good atmosphere and lacation,wagamama nicosia
50,The restaurant is situated just outside the old city of Nicosia. Has a lot of seats available and is really comfortable. They have outdoor seats also. All the waiters are friendly and accommodating. You may find a little trouble finding parking for your car.They have lots of vegetarian options and if you want to remove something from a dish and make it vegan or vegetarian they don’t have a problem with that you just need to ask the waiter to tell the chefs inside. The prices are reasonable and it’s a lovely place to eat.If you like Asian cooking and you are vegetarian or vegan then it’s a perfect place for you.,wagamama nicosia
20,"Tried sushi, awful, small and not delicious at all. And above all extremely small. Salads are average too, the other dishes never tried. In Limassol Marina there is only one good thing, view!",wagamama nicosia
40,first tried wagamama in london.ıt was fantastic.the one in cyprus is not that nad.excellent service friendly staff but there was something missing in the food. overall it was a good outing. :),wagamama nicosia
50,"I have been to Wagamama in different counties and this is by far the best one. The restaurant is clean. The service is great, nice and attentive staff. Food is high quality with fresh ingredients, prepared right there. Great balanced taste. Definitely worth a try if you are in the area.",wagamama nicosia
40,"I have been to Wagamamas in other countries as well. Really, this on is one of the best. Very good quality of food and nice friendly staff.",wagamama nicosia
50,Lovely side dishes and meals. Chicken katsu curry is the best!! highly recommended! Reasonable prices and very good service.,wagamama nicosia
40,"The food was great as always. There is plenty of variety to choose from. Cosy environment, great for families. Value for money!",wagamama nicosia
40,A very good choice to eat with family with kids. Kids love it and so do grown ups. The sushi is average but the other dishes are quite good. I reccomend noodles with salmon or shrims and the duck rolls. And they have great fresh juices. Expensive for fast food.,wagamama nicosia
40,"This place serves the best sushi/sashimi in Nicosia at least. Tasteful and simple, with no extra sauces and fried stuff to make it tastier because it already is! Everything we ordered was delicious and the stuff were super friendly and helpful!",wagamama nicosia
30,"I ate at this Wagamama again last week with my wife and 2 year old daughter. My meal, which was a chicken with noodles dish was below standard, as far as flavor is concerned. The service was great, the waitress was marvelous, and they were very nice to bring my daughter a box of crayons to draw and color with. It's a pity the crayons were of such terrible quality (obviously from Jumbo) that they didnt actually work!I have eaten in this restaurant tens of times with my wife. Sometimes the food is marvelous. Other times we have had to complain and return raw food, or food of a lower standard. Considering the luck of the draw quality that they seem to deliver, I feel it is expensive.",wagamama nicosia
50,Took my daughters who ordered their favourite dishes and I choose the sushi. all was great and service was lovely.,wagamama nicosia
50,Best value for money. There are lot of food choices from sushi to noodles and soups. Extraordinary flavours. Good serving.,wagamama nicosia
30,We hadn't been to Wagamama for a while and we decided to go. We had a curry which was OK but also a new noodle dish with salmon (the name escapes me) which left a lot to be desired. I don't think we'll be visiting again very soon...,wagamama nicosia
50,We've visited Wagamama in Paphos many times but this was our first visit to the Nicosia branch. It was perfect. We were a bit boring and ordered things we already know and love. It's just got to noodle weather. I had the huge bowl of ramen noodles. Nice warm saki. Great. Fantast service.,wagamama nicosia
40,Great food and so many vegetarian options!! Will be visiting again with friends soon for sure! There's tastes for all!,wagamama nicosia
30,"I have visited Wagamama many times and in my previous review I gave it a 5* rating. But since then we were disappointed a lot by the service. At one of our previous visits we had to wait a long time before someone came to take our order, and we could see the waiters talking and giggling and not paying any attention to the customers. When they did take our order, and even though they used a device to do so, and repeated the order to us, my dish was never ordered. I guess it happens but it was really hard to get someone's attention after that and let them know. When we did ask a waiter about it he said he would check but never came back, so I finally had to get up and find someone to let them know that my dish never arrived. On a positive note they did not charge us for the dish when it finally arrived so we decided to give it another go. But our last visit was not perfect either. Service again was mediocre, we had to order a drink three times before it was brought to the table. We also explicitly asked for seats with back support when making our reservation but when we arrived we were assigned a table without. They did manage to accommodate us in the end, but it would be better if they had reserved the correct table in the first place. Also, a lot of the waiters do not speak or understand Greek, which makes it hard for older locals to communicate with them. Still love the food, though we could do with larger portions, but not sure it's worth the stress of the experience.",wagamama nicosia
50,A night out with my 21 year old daughter to one of her favourite places turned out to be very enjoyable and comfortable. As a vegetarian it is not always easy to go out to eat in Cyprus but Wagamama made it to the top of my list,wagamama nicosia
30,"not even close to a good glamour restaurant, yeah i know its asian food but due to the prices it is a little bit fail to sit on picnic tables outside, food average sry guys its my opinion i didnt like it though i used to eat at wagamama in london!!!",wagamama nicosia
40,Would definitely recommend it! It offers a fast-food kind of japanese food but its tasty and not at all expensive! The stuff is super helpful and friendly. Give it a shot,wagamama nicosia
50,Perfect Asian food in a unique atmosphere in the center of the capital. Fast service and very good quality food at very reasonable prices.,wagamama nicosia
40,"Simple and adorable, in a central street downtown Nicosia, excellent service and plates from Asia. Plates for all preferences. Well organised restaurant, value for money bills.",wagamama nicosia
50,"I actually ate there much earlier than October 2014, but this application won't allow me to enter an earlier date. Truly this was my favorite restaurant in all of Nicosia. I love Asian food and this restaurant has quite the fusion and variety to keep anyone happy. It sure did me. For a few weeks, I think, I either went and ate there or ordered delivery from there a couple times a week. I often went with one friend who also liked Asian food. I tried to try everything, but kept getting back to their beef sukiyaki, orange and chicken salad, gyoza, edamame, and chicken katsu. I seem to remember they were a little bit on the expensive side, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the heck out of their food as often as possible.",wagamama nicosia
50,"very good restaurant, just don't like their sushi, but all other meals from menu are nice. Always take teriaki soba and ramens.",wagamama nicosia
50,"We visited Wagamama, for dinner. It was the first time i visited the Nicosia branch. The place was peaceful and quiet, even though it is located next to one of the main streets of Nicosia.Upon our arrival, a waiter came to assist us. They gave us a table near the parking, which was quite nice. After a while, we made our order and the appetizers came around 15-20 minutes later. By the time we finished, the main dishes came. We also ordered a desert. Everything we tasted was really good, and enjoyable.I will definatelly visit Wagamama again in the near future.",wagamama nicosia
40,"We had ramen and terriyaki. The food was good, the service was very good. It was a little hot inside the restaurant and very growded. We were pleased to have seats with back support.",wagamama nicosia
30,"The food is ok. Most of the dishes taste more or less the same, particularly the medium to hot dishes. We have found this restaurant to be noisy and crowded.",wagamama nicosia
30,"On the strength of past experience, we selected Wagamama for dinner in order to celebrate my nameday. Alas, this time Wagamama did not live up to their high reputation. Reserving a table proved to be too much of a hassle; I had to wait on the phone for about eight minutes, hearing “Your call is now first and will be answered by the first available representative” and “Thank you for your patience”. Patience, indeed patience is what was needed!It was four of us and we opted to sit inside (as opposed to the veranda outside) in order to enjoy the air conditioned environment – a very advisable move when the weather outside is humid.The waitresses were very courteous, very efficient, very helpful and had a charming smile on their face. The restaurant area was roomy, clean and pleasantly decorated.The food was delicious and very well presented – we ordered Teriaki Chicken Raisu and Chicken Katsu Curry. However, compared to the other times that we have dined at Wagamama, the portions have shrunk substantially. We barely filled our stomachs! At payment time I mentioned this to the waitress; she expressed her concern over the matter and opined that we ought to have asked for more as at Wagamama they do not want customers to leave unsatisfied. On the strength of this we may give Wagamama another chance.",wagamama nicosia
30,"Some people love it, some hate it. I'm in between. Portions are a bit small for the price. The food it's so standardised, that you almost feel you're eating at a chain fast food restaurant",wagamama nicosia
40,"Good location as is at Nicosia towntown.The Restaurant is clean and has modern decoration, works as fast-food restaurant but has friendly waitors and service is very quick. Food is tasty but is overpriced as portions are not very big. My own plate curry chicken has too much sauce and only 4 finger-size pieces of chicken.Generally speaking is very good but in my opinion could be better.",wagamama nicosia
50,Consistant food... great sushi...best to book a table especially on weekends. Order your drinks at the same time as the food as wait staff tend to vanish,wagamama nicosia
30,an average restaurant. The quality has dwindled since they first opened in Nicosia.The sushi is decent.,wagamama nicosia
30,Not so good for what it is supposed to be. Nice environment but medium level food!!! And the prices were really high!,wagamama nicosia
50,"Friendly, family atmosphere, fast service, very good choices of meals for all the kinds.. tasty and very good service.. we love it and we go there always when we want somenthing differenet..!!",wagamama nicosia
40,"Very fast service, good taste. Convenient location also for customers coming from the North side of the city.",wagamama nicosia
20,I took away some sushi from Wagamama during a business trip in Nicosia. The sushi was totally tasteless and it contained coliandro (in Cyprus they put coliandro everywhere but I didnt expect to find it in Sushi!!). I am still wondering why it was full and there were people waiting in the entrance to sit there. There are better places to eat in Nicosia.Not recommended.,wagamama nicosia
40,"Very prompt service, fast delivery of food and friendly staff. The food is almost always great, with the odd exception on very busy evenings (although not anything to complain about - just a lack of wow factor at times). The prices are fair and am pleased to see they have started bringing in some spicy options finally for the minority of us in Cyprus that enjoy the kick - which is supplied at most Wagamama restaurants in the UK and elsewhere.",wagamama nicosia
40,Decent place with the standards. Service is very good most of the time. Food comes quick and the staff is helpful. Food quality is how it should be..very good. Car park is a little problem as their car park is small and full most of the time but parking slots available nearby.Recommend!,wagamama nicosia
20,"Been once, will not go again.Service is terrible - it is slow and waiters thumbs are actually in the food. they also brought and open bottle of wine to the table and were arguing when I asked for an unopened one to see what they were bringing me.The food was mediocre at best - sushi tasted old, noodles tough and the other items we ordered were ""OK"" - nothing special.On top of this, the prices are high - way higher than the quality of food they are serving.",wagamama nicosia
50,Have visited this restaurant a lot and it has yet to disappoint. Love the food and the relaxed atmosphere and will be returning soon.,wagamama nicosia
40,"we had a dinner with family.the waiters were helpful , explaining the food. They told us that food won't come on same time because of different preparation times. We order 4 different menus and tasted each others foods.They were delicious.The waiter even informed me about the hotness of souce she served.The atmosphere is friendly.",wagamama nicosia
30,"I have visited this restaurant several times in the past, but every time I was leaving a bit dissapointed, since I was not satisfied with the quality of the food and the service. Since they recently advertised that 20 new dishes were added to their menu, I decided to give them one more chance. So, a group of friends and I visited it again last night (5 people in total).There was indeed a bigger selection of choises in the menu, so it was easier for me to find something I could eat, since I don't like noodles. We ordered 5 main dishes, 3 sushi plates and 2 side dishes, from both the old and the new menu.The two sides (edamame and soba wakame salad - old dishes which we had tried before) were tasty. The teriyaki chicken donburi (a new dish) was too dry, so we had to order extra teriyaki sauce in order to eat it and the ratio of chicken to rice was unbalanced (too much rice and too little meat). My boyfriend was not super excited about his dish too (chicken katsu curry) and we all agreed that the sushi was average too.The only point of improvement compared to our previous visits was that our waiter was Cypriot, so we could order in our native language (thing that never happened at any of the other times). Also, the service was fast and accurate.Tha final bill was 107 euros (we didn't have any drinks or dessert - just 2 bottles of water), but since we had a 25 euro discount coupon we ended up paying a bit more that 15 euros per person.To sum up, although the menu additions were a posivite thing in terms of variety, the quality of the food was still unsatisfactory for me. Also, I don't feel that the prices correspond to the quality of the food even though I was positively surprised by their service this time. Unfortunately, I am still not sure if I would like to visit this place again.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Had a nice experience, even though we had to give the soup back. The food is delicious and the menu has a few good choices. As well the service was fast and professional. The sushi was excellent and I will for sure go back.",wagamama nicosia
50,"In this hot and sticky city there is an oasis of healthy good food that is tasty and not too oily: Wagamama! Great starters, fresh noodles and soups, very friendly staff. Near the centre of the city, the terrace radiates calmth. Well worth a try!",wagamama nicosia
40,Not somewhere you will go once a week. personally anyway. I like the fact that you can see the chefs preparing the food as this adds a unique style to the restaurant. Food is excellent although it is quite expensive.,wagamama nicosia
30,"Been to this restaurant several times and have also ordered delivery. Several times when we went we had to sit at uncomfortable tables which could not accommodate strollers. Food varies, probably depending on the chef that's working on the day. Also, food can be spicier on days and na lot milder on other days. Try the mushroom soup or the steak soup, or the udon noodles which can be quite nice. Prices are a bit steep for a chain restaurant, and the service is okay.",wagamama nicosia
50,Loved the place! It has a great atmosphere and the service is really good! The food was delicious!!! We really enjoyed our night and we totally recommend it to anyone!!,wagamama nicosia
30,Loved Lollipop prawns Kushiyaki. Everything else was just ok and served in tiny portions. Looking at my bill I just realised that we ordered twice each choice because...see above.Attentive and patient Cristina was very helpful.Very trendy and simple decor....and benches for youngsters having no back problems.,wagamama nicosia
40,Both food and atmosphere are worth the visit. Very polite staff trying to please the customer at every occasion! The menu although Asian will please the biggest meat eater as well! The sushi is worth a try!,wagamama nicosia
50,"So happy there a waggas in cyprus ,exactly the same menu as in the uk apart from they got sushi on the menu aswell",wagamama nicosia
40,Make sure you sit inside as the 'outside' bit is actually almost completely enclosed in plastic sheeting and unless you are a smoker not a pleasant experience. Similar to all other Wagamama restaurant but there is no central 'sharing' table but individual smaller ones which makes the experience a bit more personal. They also take bookings AND deliveries',wagamama nicosia
40,"Went to Wagamammas for Lunch break, I had excellent Miso-soup and Tofu-chili, which deserves the attribute “hot”,I like it hot and a good sign of proper hotness is, if you start to sweat on your forehead – this was the case indeed. So only order it If you can stand it , the staff was very friendly, a lot of waitresses there, so your wishes are in numerous and good hands.As a desert there was some crème brülee cake, which was also very fine. So restaurant is recommendable for lunch break, also if you are Vegetarian,The food is marked with a “v” on the menu, which is very helpful.",wagamama nicosia
30,"We ordered tori kara age as a starter which tasted awful, it tasted like it was fried in re-used oil, and the chicken was so hard. We also had pad thai noodles which we loved. As a desert we took fried bananas with ice cream, toffee and ginger. Again, bananas were black on the outside and tasted like old re-used oil. Ice-cream was good. If we go back again we will definitely not order anything fried!",wagamama nicosia
40,"Every time I'm in Nicosia my business partners take me to a quick lunch to Wagamama which serves much more lighter food than traditional mezze. Not that I don't like mezze, but if you eat in Wagamama, you have a chance to return to the office.I recomend the nice soups they have.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Good food, if you are into Japanese cuisine, could be peculiar for someone who does not like it...good quality, fairly priced food...place is clean and friendly.",wagamama nicosia
30,Its an om place. Attentive staff. Not healthy and not bad just ok. Its quite pricey when you go for the japanese choices which is not their strength. Not a bad place when u are out of choice.,wagamama nicosia
30,"I'd say the food is average,been to Wagamamas which had food tasting better. the setting is average,you dont feel much the Asian atmosphere and feels a bit like eating at a food stall but all in all you can pay a visit there for a change of cuisine.",wagamama nicosia
30,"The food is great, waiters are helpful but the Nicosia location is so busy and noisy that you really can't relax and enjoy your food. Lastly given the stressed atmosphere, it should be less expensive.",wagamama nicosia
50,We have enjoyed best dinner there. The quality of food and service is excellent .Prices are also very good. Comming back soon :),wagamama nicosia
40,"We visited Wagamama on a Saturday noon for lunch.There are manymany options to choose from and based on the fact that it is actually a fast food place, service was great and food was quite good.I must say that prices are a bit high for what you get and where you get it. The place is crowded most of the times and it is quite noisy. The tables are not that comfortable especially if you have a baby stroller with you.But it is a different choice for a different lunch than the usual ones.We will defianately go back for casual lunches but we will try to avoid busy days and times.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Wagamama offers a range of food choices, quick service and good atmosphere for either lunch or dinner.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Very nice food.The service was very good. Has nice atmosphere and clean, open kitchen. A very good restaurant for fusion japanese.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Don't expect a celebrity chef, but expect consistent, high-quality, high-value, delicious Japanese food served with high expediency and efficiency. Great vibe!",wagamama nicosia
50,"Very busy sunday lunch, but the service and the quality of the food were amasing! It is unbelivable how this guys can keep so high quality of service, when the restaurant is packed and even 20-30 people are waiting in queue. Deffinetly a must visit restaurant!!",wagamama nicosia
50,"The food is delicious and the variety is good. even though I don't like spicy food, I can still find excellent choices such as teriyaki chicken :) The staff is friendly and the service is very good :)",wagamama nicosia
50,"We enjoyed a very good atmosphere, friendly staff and above all the delicious food choices. Specifically the sushi choices were fantastic and the staff suggestions were accurate to our taste.",wagamama nicosia
40,Very helpful staff. Fast and friendly service. Affordable prices and nice food of the kind. Otherwise like all other Wagamamas.,wagamama nicosia
40,"As long-time Wagamama fans from the UK, we were interested to see how it compared. The menu had a lot more sushi on it (as Japanese restaurants are scarce in Cyprus) but all the hot favourites were there, maybe a few noodle dishes missing. Flavours were what we expected, but there was a local twist to some dishes, like the chilli squid came with tentacles attached (very tasty, and typical of Cypriot fish restaurants).Maybe as a reaction to negative reviews below, our waiter was overly friendly, commenting A LOT on our drink and food choices, and came off seeming a little creepy. It was just trying to hard, and if they relaxed a bit then the service would be great.",wagamama nicosia
40,"This is a perfect choice for quick served food but with quality at high standards. It offers may options for rice plates, noodle plates and very good selection in sushi. You should try rainbow roll and spicy tuna.",wagamama nicosia
30,"Visited with friends, the atmosphere was very nice, the food was tasty, we even had some sushi which was very nice, but the fact that the food arrives with no timing schedule is a big minus when the idea was to enjoy dinner with friends, reasonably priced",wagamama nicosia
50,"An extensive japanese fusion cuisine based on a quick service and informal experience. Based on noodles and rice and a choice of sushi, wagamama is amongst my favorite japanese restaurants in Cyprus. Service is quick and you can experience fresh and fusion exotic taste.A must if you are in the capital and looking for something different.",wagamama nicosia
40,"perfect service, waitresses with a smiling welcome, food is very good for whoever wants to try a different food experience :))",wagamama nicosia
50,"When it comes to franchise restaurants Wagamama Nicosia is always a safe choice! You get exactly what's on the menu, they have a fast and efficient service, friendly stuff, clean place and food and a good variety of dishes.",wagamama nicosia
20,"After waiting for quite a long time to sit -even if there were empty tables - noone was coming to get an order. We had to ask from a staff member to order, and even after that the service was really slow and the staff was not really friendly. At the top of that we have asked a plate for take away and after a long time we have decided to ask someone for our dish. However, instead of bringing the dish to our table, that person decided to put it in a bag and leave it at the counter. We had to ask for a second time in order to get our order...Grade: 2 out of 5 just because of the good dishes.",wagamama nicosia
20,"I have been once to Wagamama and I don't think I will go again.There are a lot of bad points to mention about the visit such as the wine being brought to the table already open, the slow service, the arrogance of the staff serving and much more.Add to the above that the food was mediocre at best, then you have a very poor dining experience.The money that you pay for the food, compared to the quality, portions and service is no where near worth it - it was a very expensive and disappointing meal.",wagamama nicosia
30,I visit this restaurant 3 times with my wife and child the food is average the quality is not any special than the price the price is more expensive the service is very good but i am not going again,wagamama nicosia
50,"On the strength of past experience, we selected Wagamama for dinner in order to celebrate my wife’s birthday. We were not at all disappointed! Wagamama have lived up to their high reputation of being an excellent restaurant!Booking a table for four was quick and hassle-free. We opted to sit inside (as opposed to the veranda outside) in order to enjoy the air conditioned environment – a very advisable move when the weather outside is humid.The food and the deserts were fine: delicious, plentiful and of high quality. Service from the waitresses was first class; they were efficient, helpful and had a charming smile on their face. The restaurant area was roomy, clean and pleasantly decorated.Given the opportunity we will be back at Wagamama for more gastronomic delight.",wagamama nicosia
30,Food here is good but service is a bit hurried main courses starters came at different times but good but not value for money,wagamama nicosia
30,This is a franchise restaurant and food is pretty consistent. Good sushi and noodle dishes. Portions of mains are good. Service is quite good and efficient. Expect to pay about €20+ per person.,wagamama nicosia
40,This is the place for noodle lovers and generally those who enjoy good quick asian food!! Friendly atmosphere with staff willing to help you choose a dish according to your favourable taste!!,wagamama nicosia
40,"We have been going to Wagamama many times, mostly for lunch. The Asian menu is inventive, freshly prepared and constantly good. Service is good too. However, the place can get quite noisy, so only 2 stars for atmosphere.",wagamama nicosia
20,"The spicy soup is really nice if one likes hot stuff. For the other dishes I tried, you need a teenager stomach and not be very fussy about the quality.The dedicated parking is almost always full, unless you go there between regular meal hours - The upside; the kids like it and the bill is always relatively reasonable!",wagamama nicosia
30,"Made a mistake and had lunch here on public holiday. Lots of screaming children and sounds bouncing and echoing off canteen style environment. Had to shout to be heard. Service was friendly and the food okay, although a bit expensive for casual dining. Stairs to enter restaurant and more stairs to visit toilets.",wagamama nicosia
40,"My favourite restaurant for years. Recently, upon visiting I couldn't get the feeling of extreme satisfaction and I couldn't tell what was wrong. Maybe the environment, maybe the quality of the food.. The service was brilliant, though something was missing. Prices are ok, we even got a discount using Amex and other credit cards. Recommended",wagamama nicosia
40,"Descent food (the kind of westernised chinese/japanese). Kind of expensive, though -wouldn't score very high at value for money because of denominator. Convenient parking for customers and reasonably priced wines.",wagamama nicosia
30,"This place will satisfy your appetite for Asian cuisine. You will get a bit confused on what to order from the many options that you are offered. The service is great and the prices are relatively okay (15€ each for 4 people ordering sushi platter of 20 and a portion each). Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, just don't expect something extraordinary in taste.",wagamama nicosia
20,"We visited wagamama Nicosia a lot of times in the beginning . We stopped for a while and when we decided to go again two months ago it was very disappointing. They must have changed their suppliers or their chefs because my favorite noodle dish was not the same as before. The food lucked taste, and the ingredients were not well cooked. Very disappointing.",wagamama nicosia
40,"The dishes are tasty, well presented and they are a big variety. The service is quick and efficient.But since December 2013 the restaurant has changed the prawns in Raisukaree, our favourite dish. Since then they use a different kind of prawns, not at all tasty like before.Please Wagamama, bring back the original prawns used in Raisukaree. They were delicious, now we don' t even order that dish any more! And it was our favourite because of the prawns!Also, we noticed that the beef has changed some time in Autumn 2013 in the chilly beef soup. The new meat is unchewable, full of strings. Please bring back the old meat cuts.",wagamama nicosia
40,"A reasonable menu with lots of choices, some specials, and the servings are a reasonable size. Wait staff were attentive and everything arrives hot. Strange entrance system from the parking lot through the outside deck though. We often dine there.",wagamama nicosia
40,"The basis of the plate remains the same,( chicken, shrimps...), but you can have it with noodles, rice... Very tasty. Good for a family trip, if the children eat the tomato sauce",wagamama nicosia
40,"They never fail to surprise us with any dish they prepare very good,authentic and fresh.nice sushi and fresh juices",wagamama nicosia
50,"Very nice food, especially the noodles! Good quality and good portion sizes! The service was very good, waitresses are quick and polite! Has nice atmosphere and clean, open kitchen. Everything is prepared to order and quickly! We had a salad with seaweed and sesame which was great, the wagamama teppanyaki which was excellent, the beef teriyiaky which was nice and the dessert with the bananas and the ice-cream which was excellent also! We are definitely going back!",wagamama nicosia
40,"Nice and clean environment, very efficient and caring waiters (they keep one under their care at all times during one’s meal), quick service. Five of us reserved a table for a mid-week evening meal; the reservation process was quick and hassle-free. The food (as well as the dessert) was very good both in terms of quality and quantity.There is a private car park exclusive to Wagamama customers which helps a lot given the relative lack of parking area in the vicinity of Wagamama.An added bonus these days is that one can use coupons given by ESSO which entitle one to a discount of up to € 20 if one places an order exceeding € 40, making eating at Wagamama good-value-for-money.",wagamama nicosia
30,"The food at Wagamama is tasty made with fresh ingredients and does not take long to arrive at your table. Staff's attitude though needs work, as they should be a bit more friendly and smile every now and then.",wagamama nicosia
40,As with all wagamama the food was fresh tasting and yummy. The staff were busy but could have smiled....service is a job where a smile goes a long way! Also the chili chicken needs some kick like in uk!,wagamama nicosia
20,I went there few days before. I had to wait 40 minutes for my second main course because the waitress forgot to order that in the kitchen lying that she had already done it. Anyway the food was good . The staff is not as friendly as it must have been. I don't think to have my dinner there again.,wagamama nicosia
40,"We went on early on a Saturday lunchtime to avoid the throngs of noisy and badly behaved children that swarm in Cypriot restaurants at weekends, glad we did as we enjoyed the food before they came in. Firstly they don't do ""starters"", whatever is ordered just arrives when it's ready so we ordered twice, friendly waitress's fair service, the platter of sushi was good for the price but they skimped on the soy sauce and wasabi which was just plain stupid in our view, our various noodle dishes were very good and were full of prawns and chicken respectively the drinks were we thought quite expensive but all in all a very good lunch, when we left the place was full of kids so we felt justified in having eaten early",wagamama nicosia
30,"The menu has become a bit more diverse and varied - there is now sushi, for example - but the standard of preparation still falls short of other Wagamama restaurants, as it always has done. My dining companion was disappointed that the dish he always chooses had much less beef than usual and the sauce had been downgraded to be less flavoursome and appealing overall.If you are comparing this place with other Wagamama restaurants, you are sure to be disappointed. If you are comparing it with other options available in Nicosia, perhaps give it a try for a change.There is a lunch menu, for under 8 euro, which seems to represent good value.Downsides are that if you are dining on the terrace, you will be subjected to copious amounts of cigarette fumes, which are totally unpleasant. (Cypriot restauranteurs should be encouraged to respect the law - it's only pretending to be outside and is still a public place where food is being served and eaten!) It's true, not all the staff speak Greek but it's good to see that those who do work there, from all over Europe, are willing to work hard, and they understand enough that the place functions reasonably well.It is not good value for money - as a main course costs between 11 and 20 euro.And it's probably not the kind of place you would want to go to make a future partner fall head over heels in love with you, or close that all-important business deal, but it is sufficient for a quick meal now and again.",wagamama nicosia
30,I used to be a huge fan of this restaurant but the last time i went there i was disappointed and i didint enjoy my meal,wagamama nicosia
40,I love the chicken terriyiaki and dumplings but i think 5.50 for 5 dumplings is expensive.i am glad they have added sushi in the menu and their sushi is quite cheap.,wagamama nicosia
30,"Went to this restaurant on Valentines day. The service was very speedy, almost too quick where we didnt have time to talk before all of our courses came. I understand its valentines day and they need to keep people moving but we were in and out in under and hour with 3 courses consumed. I ordered sushi and was told it wasnt available because the machine was broken to make it??? Last I checked sushi was made by hand not a machine so I dont really understand what was going on. Nice that they have their own parking lot. Would I go again, probably, but it wont be high on my list when deciding where to go out for dinner again.",wagamama nicosia
50,"tried the new Sushi and beef Tataki, have to say that I was taken by the beef. Rare cooked then soaked in special soya and vinegar.a fusion style of beef carpaccio, Sushi was average to good.I had my usual Wagamama Ramain (my favourit since London) and was exactly the same. Its good sometimes to get what you expected.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Always one of my favorite for a quick bite to eat, not to pricy and standard are high, always clean and presentable atmosphere, the down side, everyone working there are Easter Europeans not one cypriot in the entire place, a bit of a turn off.",wagamama nicosia
20,"Wife is abroad and I decided to have a quick meal out, looking for something tasty. Wagamama came to mind. Starter was good. Seared salmon (Takaki). For my main dish I ordered odun noodles with chicken. The noodles were seriously overcooked and the chicken was tough, had the taste of overcooked, old chicken. Just below par.I had been to Wagamama once before and that time I my rating was average, too salty. But after this experience, sorry guys, never again.",wagamama nicosia
50,"The tastes of Wagamama are weird enough for you to either love or hate. For me, I like the fusion ideas of the restaurant and love their menu. The Nicosia restaurant does a good job as well. Much better than the one I tried in Athens.Love the setting as well.Family place, always go for a Sunday family lunch. Kids love their dishes as well...",wagamama nicosia
40,"If you're into oriental flavours, this is the most decent quick option. Typical Wagamama cuisine (Japanese and Chinese fusion) in a simple modern setting. Very good prices and quick service. The only downside: the restaurant's staff are mostly of Eastern European origin, meaning that they do not speak Greek (totally unacceptable) and their English is also limited.",wagamama nicosia
50,"I tend to review places that impress me or totally disappoint me.Of course, Wagamama in Nicosia was impressed me as it has been the best restaurant of this chain I have been to, so far.The place is nicely located, the decoration and the atmosphere is right, the place was super clean (also the toilets), and the food was very good!I have tried several dishes and all were excellent, to the extent that I would not consider being a fast food restaurant.Although the target group are the youngsters you could still find people of our age!!!",wagamama nicosia
20,"It’s not usually worth writing a bad review for a family style restaurant like this – it is what it is. However I have to agree with other commentators that the food here is bland, service intrusive and disinterested and its overpriced.I’ve eaten at Wagamama in London and Dubai where they present a much more professional product.It stared badly when one of our group were told bluntly that it was not possible to substitute prawns for chicken in a stir fired meal! “Why not? “ I politely enquired. Because we “don’t do changes “came the frosty reply. When the meal did arrive it had a total of four small prawns in it.Our gyoza dumplings arrived fried though we would have preferred the choice of steamed – no big deal and our fault maybe for not specifying. Our main courses arrived in a flash – Less than 5 minutes after ordering. This would have been very impressive if a) we were in McDonalds or b) the food had actually been cooked. It wasn’t cooked properly and even the onions hadn’t been chopped properly and were still stuck together. There was no chilli in the dishes which had “chilli” in their title.Service was fast but disengaged and intrusive. Our conversations were frequently interrupted without any hesitation to ask questions like “how is your meal ? “ while leaning across to scribble on the table paper mats.This branch is a fast food restaurant serving food that is to Asia what sunbathing is to Scotland. The food is bland, hurriedly prepared and not thought through. The prices though would suggest a much better product.My party of four last week was a birthday celebration so to my frustration I couldn’t complain to the manager. That was a pity because he was walking around with nothing much to do while the foreign staff were left to perpetuate the flawed model. It’s not their fault at but rather that of a poor management who haven’t really got the Wagamama concept or else have forgotten it.I wrote to the restaurant afterwards to hopefully get some assurance that things would improve for a future visit. No reply, which sort of says it all.",wagamama nicosia
30,"We first tried Wagamama when it first opened and it was not so good, I must also point out that we tried Wagamama in Canterbury, Kent when first opened and gthey had no idea. Bothe I am happy to say have improved, this may have to do with the experience of the cooks being trained to cook this type of food. The food in Nicosia is now good, the service is very good and fast.The raw juice and fruit juices are excellent. Bravo and keep getting better.",wagamama nicosia
20,"Service was good, but the food left us disappointed. Being a ""fast food"" option this aspect was fulfilled, but the young crowd was quite noisy.The food was bland and on the expensive side for what it was.",wagamama nicosia
10,"this restaurant tries to pretend to be better than cheap fast food with its style/design and menu prices but dont be fooled. quality of the food is definitely not worth the price. they do this werid thing were they take your order on a not pad but write on you paper placemat. it doesnt seen like a big deal but its very intrusive and when u are all finished eating your food they will come and ask ""if it was good"" and before u even reply they put a fat X on your menu and dont come back unless you call after them.they are the type of place that charges you for soy sauce or even extra sauce. i am allergic to msg and when ordering a dish that came with soup i was informed that the soup contains msg they didnt replace it with something else or discounted it off my bill. its just fast food, large corporation nonsense.",wagamama nicosia
50,"This restaurant has the best salads, so very healthy and great atmosphere. The service is also good along with the layout of the restaurant. They have big tables, suitable for work lunch or dinners.",wagamama nicosia
40,"I often visit Wagamama because it is close to work and occasionally they have great lunch deals.The food is fresh, tasty, filling and arrives quickly with a cheerful service. There is also parking space at the back which is a plus given the location of the restaurant in the city centre.It can be a bit to noisy when full and the sits are not the most comfortable, but that's the layout of all Wagamama's restaurants I've visited in Cyprus and abroad.Will definitely visit again",wagamama nicosia
30,"Wagamama's offers interesting propositions to the palatte for people looking to eat something 'different'. The interior is a little too simple - neat and luminous, but not boasting a special style. The service is quick although the waitresses are not always fluent in English. you can expect food to arrive on time though. It is a fast 'pick-me-up' place, ideal for lunch.",wagamama nicosia
40,"wednesdays are lunch at work days, so even if I order Delivery or go by to eat I am always pleased. Some times the service personel is a little slow or knot understanding our english (which is always the language I HAVE TO use...), so I thing they should be a little more trained either in Greek or at least in englishDelivery is always fast and the food always arrives in the right temperature as in the restaurant. Wagamama in a chain restaurant that has kept its standards well in Cyprus",wagamama nicosia
40,"The waiters were very friendly and helpful. As I have never tried asian cousin before I didn't even know most of the ingredients in the menu but at least it had a terminology kind of dictionary in the first page of the menu. I loved the starter but not the main course because I wasn't familiar with the ingredients. In general, I think anyone who likes this type of cousine will enjoy a visit to wagamama!",wagamama nicosia
40,"Wagamama is a favourite everywhere I go. If you're into oriental food in a modern setting (not the traditional ceremonial restaurant atmosphere, that is), Wagamama offers selected treats, one step up from the ordinary chinese restaurant. Service here is among the fastest. My only complaint: all the waiters are foreigners (mostly from Russia) and none of them speaks the country's language (Greek). Free parking offered too.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Just like any wagamama anywhere, fast reliable service, they also do delivery! Its an ideal place for kids with a large open eating area outside. Its almost always busy which is a good sign.",wagamama nicosia
30,Knowing the London sisters one would have expected to find the same quality. But the Nicosia Wagamana does not at all live up to the expected standard and quality.,wagamama nicosia
40,"having never been to a wagamamas before I did not know what to expect, but overall impressed with the quality of food. Not good for a relaxing night out, but great for fast light fresh food",wagamama nicosia
50,"We first discovered Wagamama in Amsterdam and loved it. The service was excellent, the food tasty and healthy and the prices decent. So when it opened in Nicosia we were delighted, even if worried that the local lack of service culture and ridiculous prices may also infect Waga. Luckily, we were wrong. We have been going to Waga since it first opened but I was just prompted to write a review after revisiting with friends a few nights ago. The service is still excellent and fast. The staff, most of whom we now recognize because they have been there a while, is knoweldgeable and polite by local standards. And the fact that they do not have a high turnover (as other places) means something to us. The food is still healthy, good portions, very well prepaped. And what I like most is the fact that they keep adding new dishes, they keep experimenting (so do not sit on their laurels) and in the summer the choices are truly excellent for the extremely hot and humid weather-- in fact, it is one of the few places where I can truly find something refreshing to eat. The orange salad is very good and the shakes and fresh juices (esp the one with ginger), even if a bit pricy, worth a try. I also like the fact that Waga is one of the few places with a big selection for vegetarians and one of the handful of places in Nicosia that serves tofu which I love. Ok, the benches are not comfortable and the atmosphere is not great, but for a quick and healthy family mean out this is just fine. And the bill is not bad for Nicosia standards. Not cheap but good value for money compared to what else is out there. Oh, don't leave without trying the wasabu chocolate cake!",wagamama nicosia
40,"Wagamama is internationally known for its simple unpretentious, good quality cuisine and the same goes for the branch in Nicosia. On my visit both service and food were to the standard expected at an affordable price.",wagamama nicosia
50,"Went last night for dinner with family and ordered our usual mixture which we share. Chicken dishes I quite enjoy personally and their ""spicy"" dishes are also very tasty. Rice is well cooked and in general I have never been dissapointed with the quality of food. Service is always very good although occasionally have trouble communicating as the staff are not native greek or english speakers. Dishes arrive very quickly and never had any mistakes occur with our orders. Hopefully they will open up in Larnaca too so we can enjoy locally.",wagamama nicosia
50,We wanted a change from the Cypriot cuisine so went here without booking. It was excellent and fulfilled our expectations in every way. The service and timely delivery of food and drinks was spot on. We have not always found it this way in Nicosia.,wagamama nicosia
40,"this restaurant had a very nice cuisine now it added 11 new plates i havent try them yet and i thing they tryed to approach all tastes, the prices are good but is true some food dont have taste some are very good though. simple, fresh and asian. free parking is also offered. i did not like the way of serving there though,were the waiters need to right on the table in front of the client on their set ups this had nothing to do with the way waiters were serving though.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Best as a lunchtime venue - quick, tasty and value for money",wagamama nicosia
30,"Nothing special, same standard food with ok pricesAvailable car park, standard food comparing to London branches. Sometimes the dishes lack of taste. But in general everything is cooked from fresh. Price wise, it’s a value for money, average spend is 25 Euros for three course meal. My only comment is that dishes not clean; you can always spot greasy edges or finger prints.service is average, no consistency, sometimes Im served very fast, while last time my plate stays on the pass more than 7 min until I grabbed it myself. the waitress simply disappeared and wasn't even busy.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Food is fresh but tastes are rather mild, and unsalted, so may not be to everybody’s liking. Choice is now better as new items were added on the original menu.Our waitress didn’t try to connect with us, didn’t smile and service was carried out in a very mechanical way. On previous visits, though, our experience was better.If you want quiet, don’t sit in front of the main cooking area. The cooks on the one hand and the young kids on the other don’t make conversation easy. If you can, sit in the area on the right as you come in from the main entrance on Themistoklis Thervis Street. If I’m not mistaken, there’s a semi-closed area also for smokers which I haven’t used.Prices are about average for Nicosia and better than most “proper” Asian or Chinese restaurants. In any case, hard wood benches tell you that it’s all about eating and going away.",wagamama nicosia
30,"Average food quality, basic menu, value for money. Good for families with small childern - kids activities, watching the cook, kids menu. Not recommend to visit for business. They have parking facilities. Service is good.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Wagamama is an expanding company that ""gives back to the community"" and donates local art shows by sharing its profits. Its not one of those greedy powerhouses that only cares about its stock price. They care about customers and are managed well. I sense that they are so good that the locals in Nicosia don't want them to succeed. Well Wagamama will continue to succeed if the current chefs are working there. The food was out of this world.",wagamama nicosia
20,So typical of ethnic fast food chains: bland approximations of original receipes at prices beyond comprehension. I was dragged by collegues but I normally would never bother. I did warn them and now they know better.,wagamama nicosia
10,"I decided to give W another chance as as I had a bad experience last year, it was a decision I have regreted.Went for lunch with a colleague, we only had an hour so thought W would be a quick meal.Arrived just after 12.30 there were 2 or 3 other tables and we were sat next to exit door, possibly the worst table in the restaurant as waiters, customers and the cold air kept coming through.We moved ourselves to the annoyance of the waitress! Once ready to order it took us over 10 mins find a waitress. We ordered, and waited for our food and drinks.The beers arrived quickly but our food was taking longer than it should have. After about 20 mins, I asked our waitress and she immediately said: its on its way! So we orderded 2 more beers.Another 10 mins pass and I am getting annoyed, no sign of our food. I catch the gaze of who must be the host and I ask her to please check on our food since our waitress had gone MIA. She came back 2 mins later saying that there had been a problem with the printer and our order did not reach the kitchen. You can imagine our anger at this point, especially as we were told earlier the food was on its a way!the icing on the cake was that there was no apology or offer of a disount, just a mad rush to get our order once they knew they had messed up.In the end the food was average, drinks overpriced and service non-existant. We paid 50 Euro for 4 beers and two main courses!! Never again..",wagamama nicosia
40,"Been there many times, the food is always well prepared, very good asian fusion flavours, and a cosy friendly environment. It wouldn't hurt for the staff to smile and speak some greek :) Overall, it's a great place!",wagamama nicosia
40,"Quick dining, asian flavours. Wagamama offers a blend of various asian (mainly Japanese inspired) dishes, from ramen soup to chicken katsu curry. They have nice juices as well as japanese beer. Don't expect an asian food revelation though, as most dishes are somewhat 'westernised'. The establishment is friendly and informal yet professional and clean.Their policy is that they bring you your dish when it's done and the whole restaurant is reminiscent of a canteen (big wooden bench/tables). Service is flawless, you'll never find yourself waiting too long for a waiter's attention. A perfect spot for a quick lunch or dinner when no other plans are in place. Their delivery service is pretty good too. Prices are a bit on the expensive side but they make up for it for the good service.",wagamama nicosia
50,"This place you love or hate. I fall in the first group! You will find people crazy about it or people who have it in the black list. It's a matter of taste. Personally, I find Wagamama for example well more authentic than any other Chinese saucy, kitsch or pretending restaurant. It's a feast of Asian, great dishes. Even people who hate it it's not because of quality but simply because of the flavours it serves that maybe don't fall in their preferences.We always get a range of starters and a main. My personal favourite is ebi raisukaree. Desserts are also very good but not their strongest dishes. You should at least try them once though!! Price-wise I find it average and logical.",wagamama nicosia
40,"The usual great Wagamama experience, staff quick and attentive",wagamama nicosia
40,Very very good quality - even the side vegetables are always fresh and the food is great but definitely not value for money.,wagamama nicosia
50,A very good restaurant for fusion japanese. Edamame is a must to try. Good sake and excellent food. My son loves it. Gets busy over the weekends,wagamama nicosia
30,Healthy yes but probably because they serve very small portions.nothing special.nothing stands out from the menue,wagamama nicosia
50,"Wagamama is great both for dine in and delivery. I use to order my ""office"" lunch from there especially during winter time a ""chilly chicken ramen"" is brilliant!",wagamama nicosia
40,One of the good type of fast food places to eat quickly with friends... lunch or dinner - both are OK.,wagamama nicosia
50,"the food is great, if you like asian, thats the place in nicosia. not very expensive and very casual arrangements",wagamama nicosia
40,"I like to eat in Wagamama. I have some favourite dishes which i order everytime. Sometimes can try new meals.I think the prices are a little high for medium portions, but having in mind there's no other restaurant with such a style, I can recommend it.",wagamama nicosia
40,"There are times during the day that you just don't wish to be pestered by hosts grabbing at your wrist and trying to pull you into their restaurant. Wagamama is well run and you pay a little extra to avoid the aggravation of pushy hosts. Just make sure that you drink plenty of water and that they don't put sparkling water on your bill. The upper management does not permit this. As others have voiced, they need to increase the portions on some of their dishes.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Quite good with a big variety of food, although I found some portions small. Nice and clean atmosphere. Maybe the prices are a bit higher than expected.",wagamama nicosia
40,"Delicious, quick japanese food in a friendly atmosphere!!!! Great value for money. Relaxing atmosphere. They have some great deserts.",wagamama nicosia
40,"I had a busy solo dinner to schedule and just drove by Wagamama. Friends had recommended it some time ago.It was indeed tasty, friendly, uncomplicated. Noodles with fried vegetables.The menu is artificially hyped and pretends to have a lot of choice, whereas everything is a variation of the same;The rooms are well lit and the design refreshingly sober.And ... WIFI works very well.",wagamama nicosia
10,"I went to wagamama in Nicosia 2 times. The first time the restaurant was packed, the food arrived late and it tasted awfully bad. A year after that me and my wife said lets give it another chance. So we went again, only 3 other tables were being served at that time. We ordered and it took ages for our order to arrive! And again the worst noodles I have ever tasted! Not going there again!",wagamama nicosia

I went there with my wife and 1 yr old kid, we found ants in the juice we ordered, after telling to the waitress she told us to talk to the manager, the manager did not even apologise and said so what do u want us to do now? wow that was not even worst thing, as then he asked me if I wanna pay now or order more! IT IS REALLY a crap experience, I emailed the management but its been 1 month, no reply. I told all my friends, colloquies, acquaintance. No one in my circle will go there, I assure u that.",wagamama nicosia
30,"I visited Wagamama last week as I felt like a change from the Cypriot food I have been eating every day duing my holiday.We arrived at 8.30pm and the restaurant was about 1/3 full. We asked to sit outside as there were six tables free. The manageress informed us that these were all reerved and the only outside space was in the smoking section or we would sit inside where it is air conditioned. So we chose inside.When we left the restaurant, all six tables were still empty. We went for a walk in the local area for half an hour before returning to the car at Wagamama and the tables were still empty. We got the impression that the tables were not reserved, but that the manageress wanted to save them as the tables were all larger than our party size.We ordered chicken katsu which was absolutely amazing. This is the first time we have tried this dish and is one we will definitely be getting again.The other two dishes, ginger chicken udon and squid and prawn starter were mediocre. The squid was like rubber and had no taste.Service was good and we received lots of attention from the waitresses. They changed my cola for me at no extra charge for another drink as I did not like the taste of their barelled cola.Prices are a little higher than the local tavernas, although the restaurant was still fairly busy with local people. It is about €12 for a main dish.Overall, a pleasent change of diet. I will continue to go to Wagamama in the UK, perhaps not Cyprus due to the competition and local food being far superior.",wagamama nicosia
