50,"This was not my 1st time at Loxandras but it's becoming a regular stop on all my visits to Nicosia. Everything is served hot and fresh. Try any of the starters from the grilled halumi to the Saganaki Cheese. For main course go for the Kebab Giaourtlou (kebab with yogurt on pitta bread) or any of the nicely-seasoned chicken dishes. Any of the desserts are killers (I prefer the ""kalvas"" - ask for it!) and make sure to wash everything down with ouzo.

10,"Visited loxandras restaraunt today, for lunch. The place was busy, but one of the owners found a table for us. After we sat down on our table, they brought us a menu after 15 minutes of waiting time.We ordered our food at 14:30 and the salads came quife fast together with our drinks. Half an hour later one of our starters arrived and we politely asked when our food will come. Their reply was, that they will check and get back to us. An hour later 15:30, the waiter served the table next us (even if they came 10minutes later than us) and they brought one of our starters to our table. At this point we were furious, no one came to us to explain why the huge delay of our food and no explanation at all. We went to the manager and asked what was happening, and he said that the grill was out of order. We asked for the bill and left without eating. Noone apologised, no one informed us about this huge delay. Very un professional behaviour, very cold enviroment as the doors are open and is freezing inside. I would not go back to this place.",To Steki tis Loxandras

30,"Located on one of the most popular paved streets of old town, in an area full of bars and food corners, a very pleasant and ambient atmosphere. Although we had a variety of dishes, starters and main courses, I can't say I was thrilled. Quality was good, portions were average and tastes were too normal, nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary. Prices were above average, probably due to the central location.",To Steki tis Loxandras

50,"I have visited this restaurant being invited by a friend and I must recognize that he was very inspired. They have a wonderful selection of traditional meals and I must advice as the best the sheftalia, the grilled haloumi and some traditional saussages. Sure a place to take a mezze with friends enjoying also a zivania or a Babadzim tsipouro.",To Steki tis Loxandras

Also the other dishes were not as we expected and we are people that loves Greek-Cypriot cousin. Other question is the toilet ... near the kitchen ( not very hygienic ) . only a young boy has a smile in is face serving the dishes. Definitively junk food.",To Steki tis Loxandras
30,"As it is a popular restaurant, I end up having gatherings at here at least once or twice a year. I have had good experience and bad experience with their food. Their food is generally salty. Grilled stuffs are sometimes excellent, sometimes far from good. So I must say I have very mixed feelings about this place.",To Steki tis Loxandras
40,"In the heart of Nicosia, it has friendly and helpful waiters, good food overall but the variety and quantity is very little when you order the normal Meze. In the end you can choose a traditional sweet dish.",To Steki tis Loxandras
50,"Very nice restaraunt with traditional Cyprus food! Good service and delicious dishes! Finally great place, especially for family, friends and business dinners!",To Steki tis Loxandras
40,"Situated in one of the two pedestrian streets in old Nicosia, it's placement is ideal if you are down about town.Food tastes excellent, table location is a bit awkward since you are seating right next to the street. There are tables inside as well, but you would be missing on the cosmopolitan aura of the location.Staff was helpful and nice but a bit overworked, resulting in some errors and delays. Given it was a very busy day that can be excused, but management should take note of this.Prices were on par with similar restaurants in the area.",To Steki tis Loxandras

50,"I've been staying in the old part of Nicosia on and off for a few months and tried most of the restaurants. This is one of the very best. I've had two different and totally delicious sausages (and prefer the spicy one); absolutely scrumptious eggplant dip (babbaganoush); excellent salad (with just enough cabbage to give it an edge but not so much that you feel like a rabbit); etc. Last time I was there a group of locals at the table next to me all tucked into a delicious looking soup. I will try that next time round. So, avoid the more trendy restaurants and try this. Excellent food and good value.",To Steki tis Loxandras
50,The best traditional Cyprus restaurant! Great service and delicious food! Great place for family and friends.,To Steki tis Loxandras

50,"Found in the heart of Nicosia's historical Centre at the pedestrian area, this restaurant is famous for its High quality food at reasonal/high prices. The owners are totally focused to serve customers in the best way. Well trained waiters and personnel in General, very well situated, tables outside for most of the months. Food rather ""heavy"" but always fresh and delicious. Inspired from the old Greek cuisine of Constantinoupolis (Polis) from the Byzantine era. A must to eat in town.",To Steki tis Loxandras
50,we went there with a couple of friends. The place is in the old city of Nicosia very close to Faneromeni church. It is a traditional Greek Cypriot tavern. It serves well prepared and cooked food at reasonable prices. Maybe it should broaden it's choices on the beers and add some meat more ex pork chops or lamp ribs at the meze for two.otherwise great place great food great servicehighly recommended,To Steki tis Loxandras
50,"This is the second visit for me, after wandering around Ledras. Perfect service, and lots of help from the staff picking your food. I ordered too much as usual, as once I have stuffed myself full of hummous and bread and some other mezes there is no more room. Last time I had a vegetarian plate, which I do not recommend as it is just frozen pastries fried. This time I just had an extra meze for my main, aubergine with skordalia. I was expecting loads of skordalia (mashed potatoes with garlic and some vinegar) but it was the fried aubergine in batter, like big slivers of fish, that filled the plate, with a little potatoe. Luckily there was lots of nice yogurt still on the table to add to the aubergine. Guest had lamb chops recommended by the staff and scoffed them all up. Excellent salad. Bit expensive.",To Steki tis Loxandras
30,"Located bottom if Onisagorou..in comparison with other eateries 10 metres away, the menu is in need of an overhaul..souvlaki was dry and not very appealing...",To Steki tis Loxandras
50,"Great Greek and Mediterranean tastes. Service is really fast, and we love the fact that the owners themselves help you to your table and take your order. Highly recommended if you are in or around Old Nicosia. P.S. Come hungry :)",To Steki tis Loxandras
40,"Visited Loxandra's on our first night in Nicosia. We bumped into this place by coincidence and ended up having a great experience of local food.On the waiter's recommendation, we opted for Mezedes (Meze'), being a series of small plates to be shared. We were gradually presented with a total of 10 plates, ranging from Halloumi Cheese, Lamb sausages, spiced patties, pork sausages, lamb shanks, salads, fries, cheese balls and more!!We just couldn't finish them all and they were all delicious!For drinks we tried Keo, which is a local beer. Nothing special to be honest but acceptable.We paid €15 each for the food, which considering the abundancy, was a fair price.Recommended to try at least once!",To Steki tis Loxandras
40,"This taverna is in Laiki Geitonia, the most touristic place in Nicosia. However, it is original and very value for money. I had chicken with lemon sauce and potatoes and a beer. They brought me three small pastries to accompany by beer (for free) and a salad (for free). I paid 12 euro. The lady and his husband are very pleasant and kind people. And the food is very tastefull,, the pastries are delicious!Recommended!",To Steki tis Loxandras

50,"We went with my colleagues to have dinner there the other day and it was an amazing experience. Not only was the food delicious but also the atmosphere downtown Nicosia inside the old walled city at night is amazing. Loxandra's Kontosouvli is the best I have ever eaten in my life! The saganaki, pork fillets, tirokafteri were excellent too. To top it off we ordered kataifi and baclava (Greek desserts) with mastiha ice cream which we thoroughly enjoyed. Fresh food, quality friendly service and overall excellent dishes!",To Steki tis Loxandras
