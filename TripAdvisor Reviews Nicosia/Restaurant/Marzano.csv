40,Lovely and airy and great air conditioning. Busy Sunday lunch with families mainly. Huge menu lovely starters and salads and pastas too. Great service too.,Marzano
10,The most dry pesto and cheese as a stone. Called to fibrin and response is that’s how we do it always. (Been a guest for over 8 years.Incredible customer service. Ridiculous,Marzano
50,"we went there with my husband and i had salad with quinoa, mango, avocado and smoked salmon and it was very tasty! fresh and very big portion (i ate it all)also i had slow cooked lamb with asparagus, bell peppers, broccoli and baby potatoes (in menu was smashed potatoes but because i am not eating dairy products they offered boiled backed potatoes and it was excellent! lamb was tender and tasty.VERY FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL TEAM!i do recommend it!!!!!",Marzano
50,Delicious Italian Food and excellent service. Highly recommended!! Keep up the god job! We gonna go again for sure!,Marzano
50,The was amazing. The services was excellent and the waiters very polite. The atmosphere was very good,Marzano
30,Good for pasta and salads. A bit disappointed because they just serve you a plate of pasta. It's not like the US where pasta comes with a bread basket or bread sticks etc.,Marzano
30,"i remember it was ok when i went there. i shoud go again to see what all the hype is about because i don't remember it being anything special or fancy, looked like a middle class pizza place to me, not in beverly hills",Marzano
40,"We had lunch here while visiting the capital on a one day trip. We enjoyed taking a vegetable soup, served along with small pieces of toasted bread, and a superb dish of lasagne. Highly recommended other typical italian dishes, like risotti and tiramisù. The only bad part of it is that we paid more than four euros for a bottle of sparkling water.",Marzano
50,Sunday lunch with kids and friends. Quite overcrowded but service was quick enough for not complaining. New menu and interesting dishes after my last visit some time ago. Place to be..,Marzano
10,"Quadro formaggi ravioli consists of edam, cheddar and emmental which are the cheapest cheeses you can find in market and definitely not ITALIAN cheeses. The ambience of the place is like a cheap restaurant of a cheap hotel. Noise and tasteless food. Never had worse italian. Since we had a voucher for pasta dishes we ordered lasagne. The manager came and said that lasagne is not a pasta dish!!!!!",Marzano
40,The food and the wine were fine. The service was perfect. But what a noise ! Very unpleasant while trying to have a conversation. Accoustics were completely forgotten during the design of the restaurant.,Marzano
50,"We always like coming back to Marzano. Great food, lovely environment, good service are some of the pros.We had tasty salads this time and matched them up with fresh white wine.",Marzano
50,Gentle staff quick service and quite tasty dishes. Will certainly go again soon to taste some more dishes from the very interesting menu,Marzano
40,We ordered bruschetta and salad with goat cheese which were tasty. The salmon with veggies was ok nothing really special. The Panacota desert with fruits was tasty however the chocolate cake was not. The creme brule was ok. The service was correct. The prices were reasonable ie the main plates were between 16 to 22 euros in general and the desert around 5 euros.,Marzano
50,Sunday lunch with family and friends. Not crowded but busy enough. ThE staff is very frieNdly and the food is very tasty. I will certainly go again,Marzano
20,"Visited on Saturday night. The welcome was rather hostile by a waiter grabbing his pad & suggesting we should have booked a table as they were busy. I put this down to inexperience as being a restaurateur, I’m aware of the logistics & how quickly tables can be turned around. We were directed upstairs into the far corner by the toilets. (Despite there only being 1 other occupied table up there).The waitress suggested we move as we were directly in front of the air conditioning unit. I think she got into trouble for this.We proceeded to order our drinks, starters & mains & a bottle of wine to come with the main course.The upper space soon filled up with non bookings, each receiving the hostile reception on arrival. I could see pretty much everything going on from the balcony above. In the meantime, more & more tables were vacated down below.Our starters arrived quite promptly so we proceeded to eat. Within 5 minutes, our mains arrived. Did I miss something? Having been in the trade for over 30 years, I hadn’t realised that this had become acceptable. We finished our food & asked for the bill.The bill arrived with the non materialised bottle of wine on that we had asked to come with the mains. Yet another system failure which costs the company revenue.I may be old school but I believe we bend over backwards to accommodate the customer & give a good all round experience. Substandard food & especially service on this occasion is inexcusable. Most things can be made much more tolerable if the staff were to care & actually talk to you!!!!Food was ok to be fair!!!",Marzano
40,We had a really great meal at Marzano's. We come back regularly specifically for the rump steak. So far it has been the best we have experienced in Nicosia.We really enjoy their salads too and always choose a different one as a starter to share each time. We have never been disappointed.,Marzano
40,Really enjoyed several visits to Marzano's and we'll certainly return for more. The menu is amazing and the service fantastic. Really enjoy the pasta and the pizza!,Marzano
50,"Nice, quiet place with excellent service and cuisine. And definitely the best Tiramisou in whole Nicosia!:) Worth to go with friends or family.",Marzano
40,The food there comes in big portions and is tasty. Their pizza does taste Italian thin crust. I would recommend to go. It is just an average restaurant there is nothing too amazing about neither something bad.,Marzano
30,I had the tuna dish with puree potato and wild asparagus. The fish and asparagus were overcooked. The puree was great! The sauce accompanying the dish for dipping in the dried out tuna was mediocre. We had two waiters: One was real nice the other had some attitude.It's probably a good idea for an Italian restaurant to stick to Italian food.,Marzano
10,"Very disappointed with our most recent visit. I went a few years ago for my birthday and the food and service was fantastic. Made a reservation for two for Valentine’s Day. When we arrived we were handed a set menu, about €30 each for a starter, main, dessert and a bottle of wine. We didn’t like any of the options and didn’t think they were worth the price tag and asked for the regular menu but were told that it was set menu only that night. I would have preferred to be told this when I made the booking or at least before we were seated. The staff weren’t really helpful and just left us, so we got up and left without anyone saying anything to us and had to go to ledras to have a quick meal there instead. Not what I was hoping for Valentine’s at all. The night was ruined in all honesty. I think people making reservations should be notified about the set menu only in advance (which I wasn’t), staff could have been more helpful and not ignored us and the choices in the menu could have been nicer. Me and my partner aren’t the most picky eaters but we could not see anything we liked on the menu and for almost €60 for the two of us, I think we should enjoy our meal. Really don’t think the price tag is worth it for bruschetta, American pizza and mousse. Why was mousse the only dessert option!? I’ve not had mousse since I was a child. Very disappointed, to say the least.",Marzano
30,"New menu is a bit pretentious with jacked up prices. All food categories though, do include some basic options Carbonara is done with milk cream. Everything else is perfectly acceptable.",Marzano
40,"Ate lunch here on our way to the Cyprus Museum. The main course, chicken breast with mushroom sauce, was very good, and the dessert, cappuccino milky chocolate cake with lemon sorbet, was even better! What a nice surprise!",Marzano
40,"Visited the restaurant last night with another couple. The food was good, prices were ok and the service was good. There are two things I didn’t like. One, pretty noisy as it was a Friday night and full of people. Second one the decor, found it quite boring and bland. Will I visit the place again? Most probably not.",Marzano
40,"the food is very good, on time, the personnel polite and helpful, good location, normal prices, nice environment",Marzano
50,"clean, fast service, employees staff positive nice delicious food, would like to come again, price little bit high",Marzano
40,We often go there as its close to our offices. Food is nice and the lunch offer they have is worth (lunch + dessert or coffee).,Marzano
50,Excellent food! Excellent service! Nice atmosphere! The price was great! The best Italian restaurant in Nicosia,Marzano
40,"Just around Leventis art gallery.. Pleasant , smart / casual place. We had a special lunch menu. Pasta + desert. As it turned out the main course was too big and we passed on desert. Food was tasty, well presented, service was good. Not bad at all.",Marzano
30,"Although Marzano has a beautiful design and decoration and the atmosphere is warm and cosy, the food is not as good as expected. There are many original and imaginative dishes in the menu but the final result (taste) is moderate. The service was nice and the waiter was kind but he made mistakes (wrong dish -we were not charged-, couldn't provide much information about the wine) and the overall experience was average.The Ceasar's salad was good but ""pork filettini alla marcala e porcini"" and ""spaghetti polo marsala"" did not meet our expectations.",Marzano
20,"Visited this restaurant for lunch with my husband and two toddlers. Staff were quite friendly and brought the kid's pencils and paper to draw. We ordered salads for main course, which was delicious as always. My daughter had ordered the chicken from the kid's menu which was served with oven chips, cucumber and tomato. She ate the cucumber in the plate and wanted more so we asked the waiter for a few more slices. Imagine our disappointment when we saw that the extra few slices had been added to the bill. It's not the extra one euro but it doesn't really sit well with the customers...",Marzano
30,"If I could make a 2.5 rating then it would be perfect. The food was not good, but i was not bad either. The prices should be lower according to the quality of the food. The drink was small and the price to high.Sure that Nicosia has better restaurants.The staff were a little invisible and they did not give a bad or super good impression.",Marzano
40,"A very nice place modern furnished, clean with a warm atmosphere. Ideal for pasta, pizza, burgers and excellent salads as well. Waitors are polite, offers a quick service, food is tasty and in reasonable prices. We will go again.",Marzano
50,"Nice atmosphere, good food, polite and quick service, good wine. Visited the place twice this month and I would really recommend it",Marzano
40,"Found this place by chance and decided to give it a try. The place was packed with locals, the food was served quickly though. The pasta was good and staff pretty friendly.",Marzano
20,"Pizza dough is like from the shop, nothing in common with Italian pizza. I’ve asked to put only sauce, mozzarella di buffalo and prosciutto. But they added oregano as well :( Prosciutto was of a low quality. Don’t know what they serve else, but pizza is bad here.",Marzano
40,12 of us went here for a birthday meal. The restaurant is very clean and inviting which is a bonus.We were sat at a large table downstairs and we arrived at 1830 so not to busy.There were a few issues with the orders and we had to wait a while on one or two dishes which seemed to have been forgotten.That said the food which we did get was really nice.The prawn starter was amazing but the Fillet steak was tiny and far too much rice.I would still go back.,Marzano
50,"I've just been to Nicosia for two weeks, this was the best restaurant near the hotel and my temporary workplace.Staying for two weeks in Cyprus, I really needed the comfort of some light food. The Greek/Cyprus Cuisine is nice, but a bit heavy on the stomach for my taste. Italian cuisine was the answer I needed and I ate here almost every day, and lunch as well as dinner at times.Fortunately the menu is so varied, and all dishes are great.Service is great also.",Marzano
40,"We are recurrent visitors, because it is good quality, the kids love it, everybody is happy! My last visit left me disappointed. Ordered my usual pizza. They change the menu, the recipes and even the presentation quite often (at some point it was served on a wooden plank), but the last one was very disappointing. The pizza was quite small, the crust was soggy and thick on the rim. It reminded me of ready-made crust. The taste was average… couldn’t really tell if I got what I ordered. It used to be much better. I guess that’s the problem when you create expectations. All that said, the rest was as usual. Everybody else's dishes were as expected, good service, friendly staff, all good.",Marzano
40,We are recular customers. We like the food very much. The food is excellent and the food presentation also. The waiters are friendly and very efficient.,Marzano
50,One of the restaurants I wil def revisit as their a variety of Italian Cuisine. Excellent plates and staff and nice atmosphere,Marzano
50,"All the best of Italian tastes in one place. Great pizza, pasta and various salad choices. Tasteful sauces accompanying our food. Friendly staff and nice modern environment. Good choice of wines also available. Thanks for an excellent dinner.",Marzano
50,Went yesterday and i was not expecting it to be so good. Both the pasta and the pizza i tried was very good. Drinks are a bit overpriced. We will definitely go again.,Marzano
20,"Visited after some time. Menu was revamped but quite more expensive. Quantity is small. If you are a big eater, you will not be satisfied. Even the kids were left hungry. Chicken Marsala was totally tasteless. Pizza and pasta were OK but expensive. Not worth it.",Marzano
30,It costs us like 25 euros each person for food only and water but tastes are very nice you have to try duck pizza and mushroom rizzoto,Marzano
50,JUST PERFECT! I loved it so much and I go there as often as I can and always eat happily I love it. Omg if you go there you will be so happy and the food is perfect,Marzano
30,"I would not go back to this restaurant. The food was very average, but some at our table were very disappointed. The service took forever even though we were there during the week. It was not terrible but Nicosia has better places.My thoughts: Don't go there, if you can go somewhere else.",Marzano
50,"Very good quality, low prices, polite staff... overall value for money... i definetely reccoment it!!!",Marzano
20,"Staff are very attentive. Starters were very good. However, our calzones were underdone and our pizzas were overdone. A bit of a let down really, as the experience could have been much better.",Marzano
50,Good staff and vety nice food and atmospere. Excellent desserts. Good price. We ate pasta and chicken.,Marzano
50,It is a fine Italian restaurant with nice pasta dishes and pizzas but also you can find great meat dishes.,Marzano
50,"We have been visiting this restaurant for many years, but two years ago after a few disappointing visits we decided not to come again. Recently we visited again to give it another chance. In our two last visits we were pleasantly surprised! They have great new salads, delicious pastas for around 10 euros and fresh pizzas also! Their service got better also! Especially their salad with mushrooms and avocado is great, their vegetarian pizza and their mediterranean pasta also!",Marzano
20,"the pizza was really bad (i remember it used to be decent), steak not cooked well (too dry), the bill too expensive, the only good thing to mention is the service.",Marzano
50,"Marzano is a real treat. I had the most delicious pizza here today, the best I've had for a long time! Thin and crispy and cooked to perfection with fresh ingredients and vegetables. It's rare to find good artichokes on a pizza, whole cherry tomatoes and kalamata olives which were wonderful! The salad was also beautifully presented.The ambience, music and great service are all commendable. Well done! I highly recommend Marzano Nicosia and Larnaca!",Marzano
40,"When i visited it on a Saturday night. It very busy during dinner time but the service provided was great. The staff were very helpful ,with a very nice menu but the atmosphere and decor didn't remind me of anything italian.With an open-plan kitchen and tables very close together it was very noisy. In fact i could barely hear my date.Other than that, the food was creative and tasty.Will visit again but on a weekday instead.",Marzano
40,A great family restaurant serving authentic Italian dishes. Has a welcoming atmosphere. The decor is nice and modern too. Service is fast and friendly.,Marzano
40,"The restaurant is located at the centre of Nicosia with sufficient parking places in the surrounding areas. The decoration is appealing with a comfortable sitting area. The menu is simple but with plenty and delicious and affordable choices of dishes. The food we have ordered was nicely cooked, big portions and very tasty. The staff however can be friendlier, but then again the day we visited was very crowded.",Marzano
40,"As a regular visitor to Marzanos in Larnaca I was interested in seeing if the Nicosia restaurant was as good. Am very happy to report that it is! We were warmly greeted & escorted to a window table where menus were instantly provided. We choose to eat off their specisl lunch menu which is very good value. It offers a starter, main course & a drink for 9euro 90. Our meal was served very quickly & our waiter & waitress were very polite & efficient. Altogether a very pleasant visit. We shall return.",Marzano
40,"Variety of dishes from pizzas to pasta, salads but nice meats cooked with imagination. Good variety of desserts as well!",Marzano
50,"A contempory, well decorated, high class italian style restaurant at reasonable prices downtown Nicosia. A variety of pizza, pasta and meat & salad choices in an excellent environment with well trained personnel.",Marzano
40,The food is excellent and tasty. The environment is perfect. The customer service was very good. I recommend it,Marzano
50,"Have been here twice now, on both occasions with family, and just can't find any reasons to fault the place. Great, friendly service and delicious, fresh Italian food. I look forward to my next visit!",Marzano
50,"We visit Marzano restaurant for dinner. Friendly environment, great service, good food in normal prices. There are no parking spaces near the restaurant.",Marzano
30,... special. Average food with prices being at the high side. Tables are crammed to closely together and it is difficult to move especially if kids are with you. Average service,Marzano
40,"A great place to enjoy Italian dishes. Friendly environment, good service and affordable prices. One of the best places in nicosia.",Marzano
50,"The food was delicious. My wife and I enjoyed it. They have really good lunch deals and the fact that I am a fan of good espresso, they were able to please my taste buds with their coffee too. When I needed a little personal help as we were planning to leave Nicosia that day and head to Lefkara, I approached the manager Mr. Andreas Dionysiou for help and he was more than helpful. I will always appreciate the hospitality they showed us",Marzano
30,"Nice decoration and style, quite good food, nothing special though. A good place for lunch or dinner.",Marzano
50,Very good restaurant for lunch or quick dinners. May not be the best option for drinking wine and enjoying for long hours.,Marzano
40,"Good food, nice place,good service. Lovely music. Unfortunately there is not parking place. But is in the centre of Nicosia.",Marzano
50,"Always meets our requirements. We are frequent clients and we spent our Sundays there for lunch. Very friendly for families, the food is great the staff is perfect.",Marzano
40,"Ate lots of time and used take away service. Some starters are very italian, Pasta more or less, depends who is the chief. Argentinian steak is average, since prepared frozen, the price 25 eur per staek makes this restaurant average for quality. New pizzas are fine and worth it, but again since this is a restaurant my advice to take smth from grill, or dishes, except fish (never tried there) are excellent.",Marzano
20,"We went there for a kids party so kids made their own pizza and adults chose stuff from the menu. Kids had options for pizza between cheese and .... well cheese, that was it. and a juice. For a 12 euro pizza of a bakery size (snack portion) i would expect them to have something more on it.Adults we had pizzas and pasta. I had the pasta with chicken. Tagliatelle were from fresh but not of the day. They got dried somewhere in a fridge so the texture was like half cooked at places. Sauces of the most basic techniques and mixing and the 2-3 small pieces of chicken were not succulent but almost like over boiled. The cooking is below average and the portions not very big. I wouldn't go there again as it prices its cost based on the decoration and not the food.",Marzano
50,Excellent service from staff who dealt with our dietary restrictions brilliantly. Food presentation and quality was good. Most enjoyable visit.,Marzano
20,"Yesterday we visited Marzano with great feedbacks from friends.We ordered pasta and burgers but we weren't satisfied from pasta plates.The burgers with the potatoes were good combined and cooked.On the other hand the ceasar's salad had a great sauce but the chicken within was from a wedding a week ago,i think....WARNING : Don't seat seat next to the windows at the corner. In case you sit there don't take off your coat!!! Don't ask to raise the heat, there is no more heat in there!",Marzano
40,"I have visited Marzano many times in the past few years. It mainly serves italian of good quality though I must say, not the best. Staff is always polite and friendly.Most times it is half full and the atmosphere is quite cozy.The chocolate fudge dessert was especially tasty, a must if you visit the place.For the quality of food the prices are quite low - not more than 20 euros usually.Location is very convenient,a short walk to Ledras or Makariou and Stasikratous Street.",Marzano
40,We visited Marzano for desserts and wines. Chocolate fudge cake is served warm with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and it's delicious! Rose wines by the glass was an excellent choice to accompany the cake! Good service and friendly waiters.,Marzano
40,Visited for dinner-we really enjoyed our main course which was pasta with chicken and mushrooms.our started was undercook though: we ordered the fresh mushrooms with white sauce and the mushrooms needed some more cooking.The service was great: friendly and willing to help.We really enjoyed it.,Marzano
50,Great lasagna with great bolonez sauce. The starters are also carefully prepared and tasty. Looking forward to try further dishes.,Marzano
50,Marzano is a classic italian food choice in Nicosiq.Nice atmosphere and bery friendly staff always ready to help.Very interesting pasta dishes and pozzas.The butger choice is also avery good choice.Restaurant also ready to serve soup of the day that is very important for me as a visitor.Try the sald menu if you want a lighter dinner.,Marzano
50,Very good choice of food and coffee. I loved the food and the atmosphere was absolutely awesome!!!!!,Marzano
50,"i enjoy every visit on marzano , my favourite starter ""funghi con panna al forno"" and main ""pork filettini alla marcala e porcini""",Marzano
40,"It had been a long while since I visited Marzano's and was secretly hoping that they still had the same high standard I had always experienced there. I was not disappointed. Very good quality food, wine was superb and service excellent. I opted for the soup of the day which happened to be Vegetable soup and it was smooth, velvety and tastey. My partner went for the mushrooms with bechamel and he was well impressed. Main courses were the seafood rissotto and pennes arrabiate which he asked for it extra spicy which was duly adhered to, he was very happy. Dessert was apple pie with ice cream which we shared. Portions are on the large side. Their dough balls are very morish too. Will have to make more regular visits.",Marzano
40,Elegant restaurant with great atmosphere and off course very good food. Recommended for dinner mostly.,Marzano
50,"Excellent restaurant in the heart of Nicosia. It combines delicious Italian food, great atmosphere and good prices! Highly recommended..",Marzano
40,"The food offered in this restaurant is very good indeed. The pizzas are large and very tasty. The pasta portions are satisfactory as well. The only minus I find is that the setting is rather noisy, particularly during the weekends.",Marzano
50,"Marzano has probably one of the best chefs in Nicosia. The menu is very refreshing, containing not only what you might anticipate from a classic italian restaurant but also many unique dishes. Everything in the plate is well thought off, resulting in excellent tastes and textures. It has the best red sauce I've tasted in Cyprus (e.g. in lazagna) and tops in every other taste on the many. Service is also top, with professional, attentive and polite staff.Highly recommended.",Marzano
10,"I love Italian food and unfortunately the food in marzano was a disaster... I had a pasta dish and my husband had a chicken dish none of them was good.. we just ate it because we were hungry... on the other hand the environment was great, nice decoration and the stuff was really polite..",Marzano
40,"This restaurant, is very good. It's affordable and family - friendly. Families with young children can eat there and also be entertained especially on Sundays. Definitely make a reservation before visiting this restaurant, as its usually packed! My kids love it there",Marzano
50,MARZANO. My daughter is 16 years old and my son 11 years old. This is the restaurant they grew up with at the weekends for lunch. There are children's activities and the food is 10 out 10. This is by far the best place for everybody because the restaurant has 2 floors so the families with children are on a different floor. The staff are excellent people. We have never felt disappointed. Best pasta ever!;o)best burger ever.,Marzano
30,"My title says it all i believe. The italian dishes are not what i would call authentic Italy at all, but as a meal they are acceptable. So far there has been no exact problem with a dish, apart from that if you are up for an authentic italian experience, i dont think ul find it in marzanos. It feels more like a chain, commercial restaurant. If you want a decent meal however, then this place is fine",Marzano
50,"we were in Nicosia for the day and as it's close to the centre - we thought we would check it out! we arrived at 3.30pm but were still allowed to order from the special lunch menu. we had a gorgeous salad for starters and delicious vegetable soup - it's an extra 2.00 euros but well worth it! we ordered the main dish at hamburger and a pasta dish - both were excellent. highly enjoyable - we ate it all - which says everything! we washed it down with red wine and beer - also offered for an extra 1.00 euro - great value! and then were offered dessert - absolutely delightful teramisou and pana cotta. it couldn't get any better! both were super fresh! we were so stuffed - in a good way - with a bill of 30.00 odd euros - a friend had a filter coffee for 3.00 euros. all in all - a wonderful warm (very windy that day!), clean, very civilized, relaxing experience with very very polite service and will DEFINITELY be back whilst in the capital. Thank you!!!",Marzano
10,The only good is designing and atmosphere in a restaurant. Food and service horrible. (Especially service of managers level),Marzano
50,"Always spent lovely time to Marzano..and eat great Italian food! The waiters one more time ready to serve and answer all the questions you may have! There wasn't a disadvantage this time..the food came very fast without a delay! Much much better from the last time that we were to Marzano. It's been quite busy, Saturday night, but everything was on time! Perfect!!",Marzano
40,"i have always been a regular client of Marzano as it is very near my work and has reasonable prices especially if you choose their special menu lunches.I prefer to eat either their salmon dish or their lasagne or the tandoori chicken, dishes the quality of which has never let me down.Their deserts are out of this world and the portions are generous.Though busy during lunch time, the service has always been very good.I would personally avoid Sundays as it gets too noisy with children, unless one is accompanied with children and Saturday nights when there is music.",Marzano
20,"Before I start I should say that I am a cook myself so I might be a bit more tough on my critics, and the price is not bad.. but it was a total disappointment. Portion is small, quality is poor, I can find a better pizza than what I tried at supermarkets(the ready frozen ones) Dessert (banoffe) might be 5-6 days old, the fresh cream on top had a weird taste and it was stiff like a meringue. And well, when you name your restaurant ""Italian restaurant"" you should have Italian desserts!! Cheesecake, banoffee, fudge, creme brulee, apple pie are not Italian! Out of nine desserts only two are actually Italian!",Marzano
40,Lovely Family Time!! Great food! Perfect taste of Italy! Kids menu with games to spend some time till the food arrives. Being there more than one time. Disadvantage: quite busy in Saturdays...with a delay in serving...,Marzano
30,"Went to the restaurant on Saturday evening and the restaurant was pretty busy. It was also VERY loud. Noise levels were very high and did not allow you to listen to their either wise, nice music.Food arrived quickly, but it was average (ordered pasta, pizza and salad). Something was missing to make the food stand out.Service was OK, considering the restaurant was busy and that one waiter had to server at least 7 tables.",Marzano
40,Never dissapoints for years. The only place you get real fresh tomato juice. Decent garlic butter and panini. Quality pizza. Only thing missing is a stone oven. Their business lunch is the best offer in town and quality is decent.,Marzano
30,"The food was very average tasting and the portions were smaller than previous times. The staff would often take their time and were late in serving us. Overall, a rather disappointing visit.",Marzano
40,"Been there with friends ! We all had pastas and pizzas ! Staff were very friendly and helpful , food was really nice (all eight of us were happy with their selection) ! Prices are ok compare with the poor quality and overpriced new restaurants in old town especially in muson .",Marzano
30,"Their food it's just ok, not bad but not something special... I had the spaghetti frutti di mare but it was disappointing and tasteless... My husband had their burger with cheddar and caramelised onions. The burger was nice but the bun and the fries was a bit burned. Their prices are normal but in these prices you can have better food elsewhere...",Marzano
40,"Visited Marzano last month on a birthday occasion.Liked the variety of the menu, the food was of good quality, I ordered the ravioli filled with lobster and shrimp, and I was very pleased with the taste and quantity. My friend's plates looked great and well presented also! I was pleased with the service, the food came out on time even though it was a saturday night and the dessert was fine also! Not fantastic but it was ok!A pleasant experience overall! I will be back!",Marzano
40,"The restaurant is in the very center of the city. It's welcoming, cozy, yet modern. Staff is very helpful and polite. Food in Marzano is very good quality and well presented. They have a wide range of appetizers, pastas and meat dishes, as well as vegetarian dishes. For 2 portions of pasta, an appetizer and some wine we paid 35 euros. I recommend it to everyone!",Marzano
40,+ Perfect food.. +Great family time... - Disandvantage: Delay for food..wait over an hour to serve...:(((,Marzano
50,"Been there with my family of 4 for dinner. We had a great time, the food was excellent ... but what is more important is the service! They respect their customers, they respect their work and they respect themselves!! Thank you!",Marzano
40,"It was my first time visiting this restaurant. We went there on a Tuesday evening with no reservation and we found a table. The ground level of the restaurat was almost full. Food was really nice. I had the lobster and crab ravioli. Dessert was good too! Service the same. We paid €25 each and had appertizer, entree and dessert. I would definatelly visit this place again.",Marzano
40,"We visited the restaurant with some friends. The service was very good althought they forgot our starter and a pizza at the end. There is an good wine list with normal prices. The food was very good, I noticed some plates where big some of them average but didn't really bother us. Overall a happy meal.",Marzano
40,The food and service are very good. The atmosphere is pleasant and the restaurant is nicely decorated. We did enjoyed the food a lot!,Marzano
20,"We visited this place on a bussiness lunch in spring. After you see the ambience you expect above average service and food quality at least. We were 5 of us and we all went for the lunch offer for 9.90Euro, main and a desert.The food quality was average, chicken was a bit dry, it took for ever to come though we were the only table in the restaurant. The food is not italian, it is a mix of mediterranean flavours not cooked appropriately.The waiter at the begining said that there was a variety of deserts to choose from but when the time came he mentioned that they only have tiramisu. Half of us didnt even like tiramisu, and of course he didnt even apologise for lying. Things got even worse when the tiramisus arrived.Stailed, dry, one was reshaped into square and the cuilis that should have accombanied the cake as written on the menu, were turned into strawberries which were aldready put in the plate a day before.When we moved them aside they left behind a red dry stain.One of our guests was a famous restaurant owner, he called the waiter and mentioned the problem with the deserts, he also explained to him that this could cause people food poising, The waiter denied evertying and turned very rude. We asked for the bill, of course everythinng was charged on the bill, and not a sorry or a complimentery drink was offered.",Marzano
40,A good reliable chain. This is however Euroland so prices are higher than they merit - which is why all the restaurants are pretty empty.,Marzano
30,"We visited the restaurant for a quick lunch. I first orderes my diet coca cola and the waiter informed me that they only have pepsi cola. Then for appetizers we ordered a salad and a vegetable dish (i do not remember their names). Both of them were nice. Then when we ordered two burgers medium rare the waitress surprised asked again, ""both of them medium rare""? We confirmed but unfortunately mine was served medium to well done... I wasn't happy with my burger and the wedges were awful! The bill was normal!",Marzano
40,"Been there in the past and returned once again a couple of months ago. The place hasn't changed for some time now but it doesn't feel old or outdated.The atmosphere is mainly of a family restaurant. Lots of big tables with families and children. A bit noisy for the romantic ones or for the ones that are looking for a relaxed dinner.Service is great. There's always somebody to welcome you and hold the door for you.The menu is huge. It's probably the menu with the larger variety of dishes I have ever seen in a restaurant. For is great, we have tried a lot of dishes and we felt that everything was well cooked and tasted great.I would recommend it for a casual family gathering, a quick lunch or dinner preferably on a weekday to avoid the fuss. They also offer their menu at 15-20% discount for take away which is something you don't really see in many Nicosia restaurants.",Marzano
40,"I have known of this restaurant for years and had heard a lot of good reviews from different groups of people, but never visited it myself until recently. It was worth it. Here you find the classic pasta and pizza meals, but also uncommon ones, which are also surprisingly delicious. This makes it the only place where you can try some incredible dishes.The staff are very polite and quick in their tasks, the atmosphere clean and a bit more elegant rather than cosy. The portions are BIG, you may have trouble finishing them even without taking appetizers.In appetizers, we tried the Melanzane Parmiggiana and Bruschettas, while for mains, our options ranged from chicken to seafood and everybody was satisfied/intrigued by the new tastes.",Marzano
50,Very nice simple restaurant with nice atmosphere! Really good service and food! Try the fudge cake! THE BEST!,Marzano
50,"I really love the italian food that Marzano serves , Service is great and prices are good. You should visit it.",Marzano
50,"The restaurant is in the heart of nicosia, and offers one of the best italian stlye pizzas the city can offer, i always order the diavolo calzone as its one of the best dishes the restaurant offers, for a couple it would cost you around 30 euros and its all worth it.However if you are not a family try to avoid visiting the retaurant on saturday lunch as it crowded with children.Ambience is great and staff is very friendly.",Marzano
40,"Good honest Italian food, well prepared and presented. Fast and friendly service. Very clean restaurant. We visit Marzano every time we travel to Cyprus. Reliable good all rounder.",Marzano
40,"Marzano is a very modern, sophisticated looking restaurant located right in the center of town. The food is nice - especially the desserts - and very authentic however the service was a little slow when we went. They also now offer a delivery service.",Marzano
40,The place is very cosy and well designed for a pasta place. The only thing that i noticed is that the prices are a bit high especially for Take Away,Marzano
30,The food and atmosphere was ok and also have a clown for kids. But we had to wait a little bit more to order cause the staff were only two or three only. Furthermore the waitress serving us was very impolite and hurry cause the many tables to order at the same time.,Marzano
40,Very nice restaurant with good food especially the pasta. I have been their two times until now and i'm very satisfied. The staff of the restaurant were very nice and helpful and the atmosphere in general was really nice.,Marzano
50,"Excellent 'Italian' food, with quick service for business lunches, very good airconditioning, very polite staff, clean lavatories.",Marzano
40,"Located in the middle of the business district, and mainly catering for business people, we didn't have high expectations when we arrived for lunch at around 2 pm. The food turned out to be very well prepared and tasty (the steak was delivered 'pink' as requested), and good value even before they took off 25% of the bill (applies to all meals between noon and 4 pm). The atmosphere is a bit stark--a large impersonal room--but the service was attentive and friendly. Recommended!",Marzano
40,"Went for Italian as we needed something other than Cypriot food :-) 5 people, all took a different pasta course from the menu that also features grill and pasta. Prices around 9-11 Euro. They had a discount of 25% on all menu items between 12-16.00.All were happy about their selection - well only salt was missing on a few of them.For starters we had a selection of italian breads, served hot with olive oil/balsamico. Very tasty. The waitress was helpful and smiling and made it a good experience. Price/quality level we consider to be really good.",Marzano
40,"We visited Marzano 4-5 times for dinner. The food is always very good, prices are just ok, the atmosphere is very nice. My only complaint is about the service.. some times they delay too much (not always) to take an order, bring the drinks and the food.",Marzano
30,"Full noisy house on a Sunday lunch as always.My advise is that u get there around 1pm and manage to get your order out by 1:20pm then you should be fine.Burgers are always home made 100%ground beef and are juicy if u order them medium+ served with wedges that need more attention. Tagliatelle with pork medallions looked good too although I didn't try them personally.I think the best starter here must be the aubergines with mozzarella and tomato sauce.Pasta dishes are a good try-tried both bolognese and carbonara. General comment is that pasta wasn't exactly al dente. Bolognese sauce was tasty and a nice touch adding the finely chopped carrots,reminding more a ragu than anything else. Carbonara sauce was more Cypriot style with tonz of cream that of course went down with my 7 year old son but not with a food junkie. Didn't try the pizza this time round so no comment. Parmezan cheese that came at the table a bit late was supermarket powder like range-could have been freshly grated guys.Service was decent given the full house and the fact that a lot of impatient kids were screaming at times! Good for families but don't expect an Italian miracle. Beats TGIF Friday's across the street anytime for more healthy options unless you go for high octane cholesterol fried munchies.",Marzano
40,"This is the best Italian place I've visited in Nicosia. Their chicken caesar salad is one of the best I've ever come across. They also have a salmon bruschetta, which was simply to die for! The prices were very reasonable and the seating was nice. The place was bursting with people when we visited it, and clearly for good reason. Even though it was incredibly crowded, the service was impressively fast. Definitely will be visiting again!",Marzano
50,"Marzano is located in the heart of Nicosia and is probably the best italian restaurant in the city. I keep visiting it since it had opened and it is still great. Excellent food, friendly staff, nice athmosphere and reasonable prices. Absolutely worth going either with family or as a couple or with friends!",Marzano
50,"fresh pasta and delicious oven-cooked bread and pizzas and calzone. I have been there before but I wasn't impress, when I revisited the restaurant I was really amazed by the taste and prices",Marzano
50,"Marzano was a great surprise for us. It´s authentic Italian food in the middle of Nicosia. Great risotto, great pasta, unbelieveably tasty salad. When in Nicosia, go there",Marzano
50,Really pleasant atmosphere with very polite personnel. Well aware of their menu and helpful with choosing your meal. I absolutely loved the meals there. Tried two different pasta option and both were excellent in taste and fairly priced. Will definitely go back and tried some other options. Must visit if you are a pasta lover!,Marzano
40,I doubt you can go wrong with this place except if you are just unlucky. I was there after a long time. We had funghi portobello with spinach and gorgonzola and mille foglie as starters. We liked them. Portobello mushrooms could be maybe a bit more cooked so that are not served with much water inside them. For main we had pollo salad and pizza. They were delicious and especially salad met my expectations! I don't find the dishes extravagant here but they are very good. There is a big selection to choose from in the menu so you won't find yourself with limited choices. A place for those who just want a dinner on the safe side without any surprises.Something to improve: A renovation wouldn't be a bad idea since even it used to be a modern place now I think it's the moment to have a go on a basic lifting.,Marzano
20,"We visited Marzano with my wife and we order a risotto with mushrooms and a calzone with pesto and chicken.The risotto had absolutely no taste and the mushrooms were over cooked (almost burned).The calzone was supposed to include mozzarella, pesto, chicken, onions and peppers, however for some reason the cook decided to replace the pesto with a tomato sauce instead.Although they offered to bring me another one, I couldn't wait for another 15 - 20 minutes. Even if they did, the chicken seemed recooked and tasteless.The service however was very good and friendly.",Marzano
40,"Marzano is a popular Italian restaurant which has been around for many years (previously it was Pizza Express). We go there about once a month, because the food is good and resonable priced. I recommend their burgers, maybe the best in town!The place can be quite noisy when full, so i prefer to come early for dinner.It is good for groups or families.",Marzano
40,Centrally located with good uncovered parking. Excellent Menu with many choices; generous Salads and Pastas at reasonable prices.,Marzano
50,"Went there for a business lunch. Food was excellent, service was very nice and we were all happy with the personnel.",Marzano
30,"Been going to Marzano several years now, usually in the occasions nobody can decide what they want to eat. They have meats, fish and salads in addition to the usual pizza and pasta, so it covers for all tastes really. For good Italian, there are better places in Nicosia but this one seems to stay very popular and it is an easy option for a casual dinner. The service is consistently good too which is not always given so extra points for that.",Marzano
40,It’s one of the best Italian restaurants in Nicosia with good quality and variety of food. Nice atmosphere but too noisy when it gets busy.,Marzano
40,I visited Marzano several times and it's one of the best italian restaurants in the city. The food is delicious and sometimes it has live music too. You better book a table because it is almost always full at weekends.,Marzano
40,"I prefer having dinner at this restaurant.It can get busy so you better book but their is no problem with the noise when it gets busy.The service is very good!I love their new starters and their spaghetti bolognese and their pizza!Value is fine! For example the last time i had dinner it was with my mom and we order 2 starters, 2 dishes and drinks and we paid around 45 euros!I recommend it to couples, families and friends!",Marzano
30,This place can get busy - both for lunch and dinner - so best to book. The lunch specials are good value and include good sized portions and the service is friendly too.,Marzano
40,"The location of the restaurant is good, it' a few minutes walk from the city walls. I had a pizza Cypriota, costing about €10, which was perfectly prepared and tasted great. My friend was just as pleased with his pasty dish. However, as we ordered a budget meal (pizza/pasta instead of main dish, water instead of wine) we recieved a certain attitude from the staff, which deprives Marzano from the top score.",Marzano
50,Always a very good standard of Food and Service!More a family restaurant. One of the best in town!,Marzano
40,The food was good but the atmosphere was not remind an Italian restaurant.,Marzano
40,"Centrlly located within 2 mins of the shops at Makariou Avenue, Marzano is an convenient solution for the business traveller or tourist. Parking lot just opposite serves both Marzano and TGIF well. Very reasonably priced.",Marzano
30,"I had to stay for work in Nicosia for 3 days and asked a friend for suggestionsOne suggestion was Marzano – having followed the suggestion I visited the tavern with some colleaguesThe food was OK, above averageService is little slowOverall atmosphere does not have any Italian blend",Marzano
40,"Great food: from pizzas, to burgers, to salads. And don't forget the desserts. This is one of the few places in Cyprus that maintained its quality.Home delivery suffers considerably, but I suspect this has something to do with the delivery company than the restaurant.Highly recommended!",Marzano
40,"Very good food, good menu, good prices, good service. The place needs some good music and some redecorating and it will be excellent",Marzano
40,Always find something I like on the menu. Sometimes there is also entertainment which is an added bonus. Usually a very good singer. International type music.,Marzano
30,"I love this restaurant because of the family vibe it has. Every Saturday and Sunday they bring in a magician and/or clown which is great entertainment for young kids. The food is basically Italian, mostly pasta and pizzas but also offer meat-based options. Lovely desserts and great service. A must place to go to if you have young children. If not then you might want to give it a miss in weekends.",Marzano
40,"Good italian food, weekends becames family orientated. Lots of italian tasty dishes. fine family dining! Loved it!",Marzano
50,"This restaurant has some very very good dishes on the menu - like the chicken fillets with cottage cheese and olives, and the lamb chops... Pasta and pizza also not but I usually prefer their other dishes.",Marzano
40,"First time at Marzano, everything was perfect. Try the pizza favorita and the melanzane parmiggiano. Very good ingredients, really helpful staff and fantastic service.",Marzano
50,"I visit this restaurant at least two or three times a month. The food is great, the prices are great too and they are very children friendly. If you don't like a load of kids screeming never visit on a Saturday lunch time as the place is packed with familys and the kids go crazy witht the face painting and magician!",Marzano
