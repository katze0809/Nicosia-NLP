50,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! Tables are very spaced out for social distancing. The food is delicious!!! Sooo good! The prices are very good, and the staff is very kind and friendly! We definitely recommend it!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"The place has both a Lebanese and a Syrian menu on the main dishes although most dishes are common.Inside seating is very Arab decorated, the outdoor could have done without the plastic stone-looking walls. Equipped with TV screens for major events I believe.The place is huge, could host big events.I liked the Baba Ghanouj, not so much the hummos, and very much the sausage (Makanek). Avoid the salads, not to my liking anyway.Main dish grills I opted for the kafta and liked a lot. Very tasty and fresh meat, well cooked.Staff was friendly, and service generally good. They were a bit busy cleaning and preparing for the evening shift as we went there on a late Sunday lunch and were the only ones remaining.I cannot say much about the Syrian dishes since we did not try any.Should be tried once, but found better Lebanese restaurant in Cyprus.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Nicely and delicately favoured food. Good natured waiters. Very pleasant and comfortable envirnment.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Beautifully decorated restaurant with typical oriental atmosphere. The large choice of dishes includes Syrian and Lebanese specialties, all very tasty and fresh.Wine list is OK although it should include higher quality wines given the very good quality of the food served.Service was professional, quick and friendly and the place is extremely clean, which is rare in Nicosia.I'd definitely go back.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Spoilt for choice. Go for meze to taste most options. Select a few for a lighter, but just as tasty meal! Like the chicken livers in pomegranate sauce...",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Good service, average meze food but cheaper than other meze places, I highly recommend the muhammara and humus, and grilled chicken kebab and maybe the baba ghanoush, salads were atrocious though",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"Too expensive for the meze option. The main dish was actually one, the rest ones were salads and appetizers. 18 euros per person was too much. The atmosphere was quite good and the service very polite.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,We had the Christmas Eve diner that ... the menu was quiet good composed of Lebanese Syrian meze (different kind of small dishes) and also you can chose your main course barbecue or rice with chicken or meat and at the end desert etc the menu was 30 euros per person excluding the alcoholic drinks. The service was ok but we had all our dishes almost at once. The food was tasty. The atmosphere outside was much better than inside I suggest to reserve outside during events. We had a belly dancer too.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"with minor knowledge of the local greek language by imported waiters, , our order was wrong - in any case meze syrian type at 18 euros per person mostly bits and pieces with a small plate of meat at the end, was not worth in comparison with the full mezes offered all over Cyprus. No comparison at all. Likewise house wine was not on offer thus forcing you to go for bottled wine at a cost of anything above 20 euros in a wine producing country. All in all for the quality and quantity, this is on the expensive side though nothing special. My previous visit was great, this time , it was a disappointment.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"We had a meze for 4, 2 bottles of wine and 2 bottles of water for only ‚Ç¨99. The food was amazing and plentiful; we couldn‚Äôt finish it all and we were all hungry when we arrived. The service had the right balance of being attentive but without being overbearing.We didn‚Äôt manage to work our timings correctly but on certain days and at certain times there are belly dancers.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Not the first time of visiting! The food remains very good and the staff is really attentive. The place gets really crowded on Friday/Saturday nights and if you are seated in the middle row of the yard, you get the sense that all tables are a big company. The tables are very close, almost touching each other. The huge screen showing football games all the time, on the wall in the center of the outside yard really destroys the atmosphere. A really bad touch. Really.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Syrian food has always been a favourite. I would recommend to try different variety from the menu. Service was fast and professional,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The restaurant is beautiful inside and outside. It has wonderful oriental atmosphere (though it is ruined a bit with huge TVs all over the walls). The staff is super quick and helpful. Very good service. Finally, the food is utterly delicious: very rich in taste. Literally everything from meze menu (only 18 euros per person) is very good! We personally fell in love with moutabbal, mouhamarah, falafel, fatayer bil jobn and shish tawouk. Visit them on Friday or Saturday night (when there is a belly dance show) and you will have a great time!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,A very nice restaurant. good food. good presentation. service is perfect. the atmosphere is great with a belly dancer on saturday nights.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Great Syrian food, nice space, each table is monitored by each one of the staff, there is no empty plate for more than a minute, they will immediately remove it. Food quality on main dishes is exceptional, appetizers need a bit more attention in preparation and presentation.The experience is amazing overall and the value for money is good.I wish to these kind people their sufferings back home to finish soon, but no matter what to keep this restaurant here so that we can enjoy a bit of their great culture!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Nice arabic food selection, atmoshere average, service good, nearby parking, reasonable prices, noisy.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"Hadn‚Äôt been in a while, so went with friends.Food was good quality, staff friendly and attentive.However as it was a Saturday night, place was busy. Tables of separate groups are almost touching each other so it was like 1 long table. No privacy. These were for the tables in the middle of the room, others looked better.There was a belly dancer.Music was loud, and a mix from funky to trance.BIG screen showing the football game spoils the atmosphere.Price was ‚Ç¨25 pp with wine",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Excellent food and a great atmosphere! Excellent service and the food amazing! Prices reasonable and the portions big! The perfect place to try different tastes,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Went for the first time to above last week. The staff were really helpful and friendly and catered to my specific needs i.e. no garlic and no meat or fish helping me to choose and enjoy a lovely vegetarian meal. Will definitely be going back. Very nice atmosphere.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"We went to this restaurant with my husband after a very long time of not visiting and the atmosphere, the service and the food are still as good, as always.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,I have been a regular customer for years.Great food and prices and very friendly staff!!!Two thumbs up!!!!Must try it!!!,Sawa Syrian Restaurant

50,"By far one of the best Lebanese restaurants in Cyprus. The food is amazing, delicious dishes and nice decorated!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,We loved this restaurant. The food was so tasty and there were so many options. Staff was friendly and helpful.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Following the title of my review I can honestly say that this is maybe the best restaurant in town. If a restaurant should feed people and make them happy then this one meets all the requirements. Everything seems to be perfect. I will pass the obvious which is the quality and the taste of food. This cannot be judged. What impress someone is the project. From the moment you sit until the moment you leave you feel that everybody is looking after yourself. You don't wait, you don't need to ask anything. The waiters following your needs before even think about it. Clean place with soundproof materials and quick service. The food is fresh and the wine in excellent temperature. I went to this restaurant many times and always the experience was absolutely great. It's not a question of what cuisine someone likes. It's a matter of perfection in what you do. And this restaurant is perfect. The prices for this outcome are redicoulesly low. Many fancy restaurants should learn how these people do business.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"True oriental cuisine but without heat. Original tastes, wonderful dips but very good meats too. In fact the dips are a great option for vegetarians. The meze is really good value for money too. However, none of the staff speak a single word of greek and this is not acceptable.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,This restaurant has great fresh healthy food. Definitely good value for money. We had a great family evening. If we come back to Cyprus we will definitely come back to eat in this place. üòäüëç,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I liked this place as it was a lovely sweet spot nestled in the middle of Nicosia. The freekeh dish was delicious and tasty, but slightly oily. On my second visit there that month I took my family and we had the lamb chops which were fabulous. The mezze is as good and the variety is there. If you are looking for a Arab/Levant taste I do recommend.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"we ordered all the Kebabs ont he menu, and all exceeded my expectations. We especially love the ground meat Kebeb.The Lam Tikka was excellent as well. We enjoyed few appetizers and couldn't finish all the food since we ordered more than we can eat. But, it was once in a long time trip and we didn't know when we will come back to this place.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Went there for a friend's bachelorette party. The service was excellent, the food delicious and the prices quite reasonable. It was Saturday so we also enjoyed a belly dance show. Nice environment. Overall thumbs up!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,The food is perfect and not expensive at all! Really value for money. This place has the best salads and the best falafel! Service is good. The atmosphere is ok (syrian decor). Add on value the girl who dances belly dancing for 15 minutes.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Nice food nice Lebanese maxalepi and nargile! As it was Friday, they had a belly dance show. We strongly recommend it!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Very nice food and great quality! With excellent service always,with very genuine people! Strongly recommend it!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

50,"Excellent food, excellent place, excellent service, smiling people. Everything is grate here. I strongly recommend it!!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"We got the mese for two. It was the most delicious meal I have ever tasted ever. The service was also impeccable, such fabulous waiters and staff. 100% recommend everyone to go! (Irish travelling Cyprus)",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"You should not miss this place! Great food, fantastic setting, belly dancer, huge tv screen to watch the mundial game! Try the nargile in the end...",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,I visited the restaurant a number of times. The service was always top-notch.There is a great selection of Syrian/middle-eastern food. The quality of the plates is excellent and the food is very tasty.You can order shisha (argyle) to smoke at your table. There is also a live belly dancing show on certain nights of the week.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Amazing and authentic Syrian food. Well prepared meal with a good presentation. Also the menu provides many choices. The staff was very friendly and helpful and I really liked the decor. I highly reccomend this restaurant.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Ate here on my first evening (a Sunday) in Nicosia, encouraged by previous TripAdvisor recommendations. I was in no way disappointed :-)Arrived at c.20.00 and was welcomed to a table where I could watch that amazing bread (see earlier comments) being fashioned and cooked in the oven - amazing taste!I chose the Kebbi Maklya [croquette stuffed with minced lamb, bulgar wheat + pinenut) and Fattoush [a lovely mixed salad - superbly presented], which I followed with a mian of Shish Tawouk [a lovely marinated chicken shish kebab]. I also had some very enjoyable Cypriot white wine, which is not on the menu ""by the glass"" but was kindly offered to me as I wanted to remain ""local"".Overall, a most enjoyable meal. The atmosphere was great - loads of families and friends gathering on a Sunday evening. It was almost full when I left at c.21.00. The price was very reasonable and I have no hesitation in recommending The Sawa Syrian to others keen to enjoy a lovely meal in a really welcoming location.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Impeccable service. baked on the spot .Actually you can watch while the dough is being transformed to fresly baked pitta bread. The vegetarian meze consists of many exquisitely tasty dips and salads (Fatoush and Tambouleh) . If you still like some meat then opt for the meat meze which has mouthwatering chicken souvlaki, kebab, and lamb souvlaki. \good wine selection to accompany your meal. The place has really great options both during the Fasting period sutable both for vegetarians and vegans. On Fridays and Saturdays there is a short belly dancing show. Reservation is a must",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The lunch at Sawa made our trip to Nicosia worth even more! The waiter was very friendly and attentive, we really felt welcome there. We were two couples and had the meze which completely blew us away. After, we received free Syrian coffee with cardamom and Muhalbiyah (milk pudding with rose water and pistachio). Do yourselves a favor and go eat there, it is simply amazing.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Excellent service, delicious food, home made pitta bread... can't go wrong with this amazing place! Even at lunch time, the experience was fantastic and as a vegan I had amazing options.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"We were a company of 7, ordered meze plus three more dishes and dessert ‚Äì almost everything was delicious (the few dishes that didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwow‚Äù us were nevertheless well cooked). The presentation of plates was also very appetizing. The waiters are highly professional: fast, respectful, available and proactive without being over attentive - no fake smiles or excessive ‚Äúfriendliness‚Äù here. Looks like the owner has really invested in personnel: the number of waiters is unusually high as well as their level of training so you would get the same quality of service even on a busy day. The warm environment and the impressive d√©cor (the handmade wooden furniture is definitely the highlight) set the right atmosphere for an overall enjoyable experience! As for the prices, individual dishes are inexpensive so one can dine in very budget-friendly way, however if you want ‚Äúa little bit of everything plus wine and dessert‚Äù it will come at a price, but definitely worth it!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"If you want a traditional Syrian food experience this is the best place to go in Nicosia. Amazing atmosphere, food is incredible and sometimes they have belly dance shows and the whole place gets crazy! ‚ò∫Ô∏è highly recommended!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I was taken there for my birthday and once again left with a smile on my face and a happy tummy. The food as always very tasty, the staff excellent and always with a smile. They never disappoint me. Keep up the excellent work.Thank you",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,The food is so good and authentic. Was well prepared and the presentation was amazing. So many choices of food to choose from ( the dip selection was impressive ) . Decor was to theme and really.stood out. Shisha is also available and the service quick . The waiter was friendly and pleasant.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,I went two weeks ago for dinner with friends. Food assortment and quality were fantastic. They also have nargile and middle eastern desserts.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Being a resident of nicosia, i and many others, know of the restaurant Sawa from when it first opened. It has an Arabic atmosphere, as the name indicates, and a very successful tradition of well cooked food.Whoever is a gnostic of the traditional delicacies in arabic cuisine will find themselves in the right place to enjoy the flavours they are looking for.They have fast service with many waiters ready to serve at your demand, all pleasant, and apprehend the needs a customer who arrives there.Although all this comes with a price, which you will notice at the end of your evening. As well as known for its delicious food and narghile and service, they are also known for their prices, but, you get what you pay for and it matters",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Fantastic food, great service (very fast and friendly staff), great prices and a lovely belly dance show. Both indoors and outdoors are equally nice. This was our first time indoors and the details on the walls were actually mesmerizing.I wouldn‚Äôt recommend visiting this place on a Friday or Saturday night if you want a quite dinner though!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,We sat at the backyard. The environment is average but everything else was really nice. Everything we tasted was very good. The staff very kind and the service very good.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"It became a tradition to visit one of the best places in Nicosia-Sawa! This place is definitely one of a kind, Why? Simple‚Ä¶ Amazing atmosphere, great service, taste&quality of food never disapoints and prices never leaves you un-satisfied.This is wonderfully carried through into the interior of the restaurant, the entire place feels welcoming and homely, while giving a great escape from the daily routine.this place NEEDS to be on your bucket list.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Our second visit to this Mid Eastern eatery and we enjoyed the pleasant arab ambiance & decoration as well as the very tasty arab dishes which kept coming and coming. Service leaves nothing to complain about , however what we all disliked was that smoking was ""allowed"" and despite our strong complaint we were totally ignored. The law against smoking is very very specific and it is surprising that in so many places in Cyprus this law is ignored. Some respect towards non smokers is essential. Next time, if there will be smoking, we shall walk away.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Fantastic service,reasonable price (not expensive at all) and very nice atmosphere and food is great. The most important thing - traditional meals all are fantastic(must try all with no exception and chose your favorite ) ,a specially must try : grilled juicy chicken ,many types of delicious bites and of course that special ice cream which is my favorite - every time I visit Nicosia ,always have there breakfast or lunch with friends or family members.As for entertainment :beautiful belly dancer and huge tv screen and of course fast wifi .",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,excellent food and atmosphere also service is very good better reserve we were lucky decoration very nice,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Is one of the best if not the best Syrian restaurant in Cyprus, food is extremely fresh and tasty, service is excellent, very attentive staff, kids friendly, vegetarian suitable, narghile heaven, special belly dancer program in weekends, traditional cooking station outside where you can watch the bread making on the spot, and but not last, some authentic handmade furniture exposed for use, it‚Äôs a place that is impossible not to love!!!Tips- reservation to be done, as the place is fully booked all the time..",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"We liked the building, the decoration, the menu and the choice of vegan, vegetarian and other foods. Prices are friendly. The food is very tasty and they serve it fast enough. The only fact I did not like, they bring to every table a 1 liter water in a plastic bottle and it feels as a gift from the restaurant or like in USA, free water in every restaurant, but in the end they put it in the bill, in our case they even put to the bill ‚Äòby mistake‚Äô 2 waters, which is absolutely wrong on all levels.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,We went there to have the office party. Food and drinks come fast and you know what to expect (if you know the cuisine). I enjoyed the food a lot. The problem is that they let people smoke inside and by the end I couldn't talk and my throat was hurting me!A belly dancing quick show was also a highlight of the night.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"I had previous experience with Syrian restaurant in Nicosia (Syrian Arab Friendship restaurant so I knew what to expect, and this was the delicious Syrian cuisine. The staff is numerous and excellent in their service, and the company enjoyed the dinner. The only drawback is that due to the big room and presence of many customers inside, the place becomes pretty noisy and can be annoying for those willing to enjoy a relaxed dinner.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Past experience has shown that the Sawa Syrian Restaurant in Nicosia is a first class restaurant, offering really delicious Syrian dishes. Hence, it was our first choice for a family Saturday dinner.We booked a table ‚Äì a wise move given the popularity of the place ‚Äì for four, four days in advance; the booking was a hassle-free process.We ordered Fattoush (traditional Syrian salad topped with crunchy pita bread and pomegranate dressing), Kabab Kafta Grilled, Shish Tawouk and Shukaf. All dishes were delicious: nicely cooked, very well presented and very tasty; what is more the quantity was enough to fill even the biggest stomach!The place was a bit noisy (but acceptably so) in the big, ‚Äúsmoking-area‚Äù lounge where we sat. Service was excellent and the prices very affordable. Besides, there was a belly dancer that gave us a delightful entertainment.We recommend the Sawa Syrian Restaurant very strongly and truly look forward to having dinner there again!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
20,Went with family to celebrate new years eve. Positive: food was plentiful and very tasty; fast service; beautiful belly dancer. Negative: people are allowed to smoke inside (it is claimed to be an outdoor space but it is all covered and has no adequate ventilation system) so for a non-smoker this is not bearable...very disrespectful also for the little children and babies there. Music was too loud and we couldn't' speak to each other. A more tasteful music wouldn't have been much better.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,We went with friends for dinnerlast Wednesday.Easy access...car park available but limited...so you will have to go early.Clean place . Stuff good enough but without smile on their faces.Food was tasty..desserts were very nice. Environment a bit noisy but pleasant.Entertainment with belly dancer.Overall a nice place.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,A must place to visit. The food is excellent and the service is very good. The best Syrian restaurant i have ever visited!,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Every time we visit this place we are warmly welcomed by all the staff who are very attentive. The food is healthy and wholesome and comes in vast quantities. It is always busy and is best to book especially Thurs-Sat. We love this place!!,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Al Sawa is the place that you must visit. The essence of Syrian cuisine and the Syrian culture will be unforgettable when you finish.The plate humble and full of taste. I do not recommend it for vegans or vegetarians. If you have to eat you have to eat. The place is taking you to Damascus in an instant moment. Parking is available behind and in front. The waiters are helpfull. Mahalepia with rosewater is highly recommended after you finish you lunch or dinner. Shisha is available.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"This is going to be a rather short review since I can't define anything as less than excellent. The atmosphere was welcoming, and that's understating it, there was even a belly dancer for entertainment. The food, simply sublime, I had the meat platter (note that the quantity is for two people) and the meats were cooked to perfection, I honestly can't have enough of that lamb kebab served on Syrian pitta bread. I want to also make clear that I'm a meat eater to the core, but the falafel Sawa makes were almost enough to turn me vegan (had some from my vegetarian friends who ordered the vegetarian platter). The service was also excellent. All in all, an excellent dining experience, and that is probably understating it.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"We walked there, but it is off the main street, in the newer areas outside the old town. You should get a good map. the place is huge, and the action starts late. Arriving at 8 we were early - nearly empty. The food was good, usual meat meze stuff, the dips were tasty and we liked the vegetables a lot. The meat was really too much for us, basically a few skewers worth, but the chicken was superb, that all went. My wife liked the roasted lamb, but we both maxed out on the souvlaki (ground meat?). Service was good, really wanted us to enjoy it, but you never quite knew who was coming to the table, especially as they got busier.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"Finding a halal food in Cyprus is not easy. So Sawa is there offering halal food (a blessing fot us). When it comes to food, service and ambience its just average. Prices are steep. But still a recommended place for everyone.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,We went to the Restuarant purely it was serving authentic Halal food. Team was very happy with the food and portions were big with wide variety.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Sawa's courtyard was a really nice place to have food. We were a big group and all types of food ordered was great! The mezze was one of the best we had in the one week that we stayed in Cyprus. Highly Recommended!,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Excellent service, amazing food, and real cheap. Open for lunch and dinner. Its worth the money. We came with our two little boys and now they have a playground, so you can relax and enjoy your meal while they play. Food is always fresh. Totally recommended!! Business or family lunch or dinner, staff will treat you well.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Invited by a Syrian Banker for a business diner. Excellent, Nice place & Cheap... The Menu is extensive and tasty. Best try for long in Nicosia.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Open air seating, excellent ambiance and on top of that Quality food with the wide range of variety ( if you have been in Dubai then you would have seen similar menu ).A definite place to be if you love grilled food.Also, they serve Sheesha :)",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,The menu is extensive and the quality of the food is very good. Meze is definately value for money.Impossible to leave this place without feeling stuffed!!They have a belly dancer on Fridays and Saturdays which is cool and there's the option to order shisha.Only improvements would be a) better service (although they were very busy) and that sitting outside can be a bit smokey (smoke from the kitchen).,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,The food was great at very reasonable prices. We had meze and there was much food left. The decoration is a little kitsch but that's what you expect from these places. The staff was very helpful and polite. We were offered fruit at the end without extra charge. We had a very good time overall.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Great place, great ambiance, great food, great staff, had a wonderful time at the restaurant! Will come back again!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I have been here a number of times on weekends and weekdays and with different guests. I usually go with my wife and son and we have the fixed menu meze, plus a couple of additional dishes with a glass of sangria. The quality of the food is superb at all times. Their meze is a variety of different dishes so you are not left asking for more of something specific. The staff is at all times very helpful and from the many times we visited them, we are always very satisfied with the food and service. My only issue is that I cannot recommend a specific dish as they were all great!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Went last night for the third or forth time. The food was like previous times very interesting and tasteful. We had meze for 4 with 2 big salads and the dessert completed the full satisfaction both in quantity and quality. Service is also friendly and fast. Will visit again for sure.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"This restaurant is like a dream come true when you want to experience an oriental night. The place is decorated very nicely and has a lot of character.There is Shisha and on the week-ends belly dancing which is very tasteful!The food is also very good, but be careful not to order too much because Syrian food can be very heavy!The service is very great, all of the waiters are very attentive!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,very good food. very good choices on menu. very friendly staff. we liked all they served in their meze.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"We visited this restaurant for a party recently. We've been there before and it still has the same delicious food and fast and friendly service. The meat was tender, the salads fresh and the dips tasted awesome. Good job!!!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,A beautiful restaurant that takes you to Syria! The staff gives great service and make sure that you have a good experiencen! This is my favorite restaurant in Nicosia. Great for a family dinner or a romantic date.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,We've been dining at Sawa for years and the one thing I can say is it is always consistent! The food is always excellent as is the service (something quite rare in Cyprus). The weekend offers a special treat with a belly dancing show which is especially nice when entertaining guests from abroad. I've held my daughters Christening dinner here and have been told by everyone in attendance that it was one of the nicest Christening they've been to! I highly recommend this restaurant.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Best service in Nicosia, always kind. The place is nice, especially the back ""yard""! Good prices and always good food. Worth a visit!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Visiting a Syrian restaurant was one of my the things we wanted to do during our trip to Cyprus this time. Sawa was proposed to us by a cousin whose taste in food we trust. We were not really fond of its decoration, but we were so impressed by how fantastic the dishes were... We still talk about the mushrooms covered in bread crumbs!!!!!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Nice for lunch, dinners, business meetings Stuff friendly and polite Food is great and always fresh! You can go with kids , couples families, groups plenty of space",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Wi, sava-sava! It is fantastic place as it comes to Middle East cousine. Anything you see in the menu is top quality and authentic recepie. If you wanna try "" catch all"" shot, take meze - menu offers sets per number of guests. My personal choice here is shish mauk, although I never order chicken anywhere else. This really bear sign of quality which you will never see in European quasi-lebanease or syrian places. Another thing to enjoy here is shisha smoke. Take time to talk to the master, this guy knows the joy of smoke in the air whether one is a professional smoker or an innocent cipper. He will offer the proper mix for you, e g., water-melon and mint, if you are not member of BAT-PHILIP MORRIS- CLUB.One critical stone: wine lovers should forget the passionate drift of the finger up and down various vintages. The list here is very kiosk-short giving very limited choice. Real pitty... Otherwise, must come place, as in my case Sawa made me stay this night in Nicosia.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"We have been going back for a few years, but we've noticed that the portions of some dishes and appetisers have shrunk... We have not been enjoying our meal the last couple of times. Maybe they are becoming complacent. Also, we have to note that they allow smoking, not only nargile, in the fully enclosed back yard.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,The environment is perfect! Especially when you go on a Friday or Saturday you can enjoy live belly dancing. The food is delicious and the service is great! I love it every time i go there and always looking forward for the Syrian mahallepi at the end as desert!,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Lovely people serving tasty Syrian food. I have been to Sawa numerous times and it never fails my expectations. Fast service, fresh food using good quality ingredients. Relaxed ambiance and family friendly.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Had a great levantine meze lunch variety for two today, all perfectly made and tasting like heaven. The owner and waiters were very professional and polite. Because my companion was a newcomer, the owner brought us an additional dish to try plus a fantastic mix of levantine desserts, all on the house. He showed us around, took us photos and was very enthusiastic, which implies that he gives his soul to his business. They even had a special menu for the ones who fast during the Easter period. High quality food and service with very good prices. Highly recommended.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"very good food, very good and friendly service and waiters, good atmosphere, shisha too, warm environment",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The food is very nice, always freshly produced. In the busy days you can see pitta bread prepared in front of you. On Fridays/Saturdays there is belly dancer for amusement.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The best restaurant in Nicosia. Excellent food , very nice and worm environment. The waiters are very friendly and helpful, the food is very delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Not to be missed.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Service was very quick and the meat was excellent. Staff was friendly and the salad portions are generous.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Frequent visitors to this authentic Syrian restaurant in Nicosia. It has its own parking. Great food served with a smile by the attentive waiters. Fresh hot bread accompanies the appetizers and main courses. There is plenty of choice for cold and hot appetizers and main dishes. The grilled meats are so tender and lightly spiced. There is the option of a meze with a rich variety of cold and hot appetizers and grilled lamb, chicken and kofta. Nice desserts and a perfect Syrian coffee at the end. On paying with a credit card, the captain has given us a discount as well! Highly recommended!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"We were meant to go to another Syrian restaurant but bumped into this one as we were in the area. We decided to give it a try. Generally we love Lebanese - Syrian cuisine however the food here was just OK. Nothing to write home about. So was the atmosphere. The salads were not seasoned, the meat was just OK, We found ourselves eating the tasty pitas which are freshly made right in front. The Mahalepi was delicious. At least the bill was not a rip off.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

50,"There are three things that define a restaurant: the food, the service and the atmosphere. Sawa scores top grades I all three areas. Visited with my family and had a great night, the food was delicious and came in fast. The waiters were so attentive, catered for every request/query we had. The atmosphere was great - the exotic, oriental d√©cor gives you the impression you are in the Middle East and we particularly liked the belly dancing as it provided an entertaining element. The surprise of the night? The bill which confirms all other reviews that this place is indeed value for money.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

40,"This is restaurant where real good food is served. They cater for a discerning clientele, under a leafy environment, an outside garden covered with a huge oriental cloth, to give the impression of an Oasis tent. W!e ordered their meze with a few appetizing dips, and Syrian bread to start with. I was impressed with their salads. Their grilled kebabs were tender and digestible. The staff were very courteous and helpful, though some of them do not speak Greek and little English. At about 21.00 the whole place erupted into Arabic music to the appearance of a local belly dancer, enjoyed by all. We dined on about 20Eu per head but that's because he had hardly any drink, just a small beer and a small bottle of wine, for just the 2 of us. The other 2 drank water. There was a good ambience to the place and the evening passed enjoyably.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,We visit the restaurant 5-6 times a year but it was the first time to be there on Sunday for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised. Food was great as usual but above all it was also fresh and the smell was great.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant

40,"Sawa is great for lunch or dinner, the people, the location, the service and the food.The starters are delicious houmous, aubergine, yogurt, spicy, creamy and full. The service is ok, a bit slow when there is a lot of customers though, but the staff is always great and friendly. Meat plates such as kofte, shish taouk, chops, liver all cooked nicely, not very big portions though you need to choose a couple in a combination at least between two persons. You can also enjoy nargile/shisha made for you by a specialist at the low price of 8 euros and you can choose from a variety of flavours.Highly recommended.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

50,"We came to Sawa for a lunch and it was all perfect. I mean the location, the interior, the service and the food.Sawa looks great and it is that exclusion when a nice, rich looking restaurant serves an excellent food. All we have ordered was great but I would suggest to be sure that you will enjoy the real Syrian food. I ordered their famous pilaf made of wheat seeds with boiled lamb and the pilaf itself was great when the boiled lamb is pretty specific and definitely is not for everybody.The starters were outstanding: every Cyprus restaurant offers hummus so it can be a nice indicator of the kitchen. The Sawa hummus was great: a little spicy, creamy and full with taste.The service was great and friendly: one of the best we met in Cyprus.The pricing is very reasonable: around Euro 65 for 3 persons.Highly recommended.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

50,"We were looking for somewhere to have dinner on Easter Sunday while staying in Nicosia; everything seemed to be closed. We rang a French restaurant in the town, and the owner told us they were closed, but highly recommended Sawa and said this is where she and her husband go for the best fresh food in Nicosia. A recommendation from a restaurant owner seemed reliable, so we booked a table and went this evening.We had a fantastic time. Everything was superb: the food was all freshly prepared, plentiful, and extremely tasty. A particular hit was the fried aubergine, which was melt-in-the-mouth. The mushrooms in breadcrumbs stuffed with feta were fabulous, as were the cheese pastries. It was all terrific. Wine was also very reasonably priced, and high quality-we drank local wine, which we enjoyed very much.Another real bonus was that they bake their own bread in house, and we were lucky enough to be seated next to the bakery area. We had a great time watching the Baker, and he responded not just with delicious bread but, at the end of the evening, two pittas in the shape of hearts!This gives some indication of the really outstanding feature of Sawa - its staff, who were among the best restaurant staff we have ever come across in a long history of dining out around the world. Not just the Baker, but both men who waited on us were professional, friendly, and generous at all times. They made it a real pleasure to be there in addition to the fabulous food. We were actually sorry to leave.Thanks to all at Sawa, and we can't recommend this place highly enough.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

30,"Regular customer. Excellent service, great atmosphere, very good food. However there are some inferior food options in terms of quality so you might want to give it a second chance if you are not satisfied the first time. Portions are neither huge or small.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"this is the best restaurant in Nicosia. Value setvice and atmosphere. Waiters always happy and willing to help, food always top notch. Its the favoritte place for over 10 years.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"This restaurant replaced the Lebanese Abu Faisal restaurant, and we decided to visit it to find out if it kept the same quality and standards.The restaurant decoration has been completely changed to a very beautiful and classy Damascus style; the entrance was impressive and the walls and ceiling were all covered with superb carved wood panels inlaid with shells.The reception was warm and the service was excellent.The food quality was generally below standards with only 3 exceptions the Chicken liver; it was delicious, the Falafel were freshly made, and the Spinach pies were tasty.Prices were to the high side compared to the quality and quantity served; you simply pay for the decoration.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Great food good service and good value. Always enjoy our night out at Sawa. Looking forward till next time. Well worth it.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant

40,"Spent an early new years eve here and as on previous occasions everything was great. While some restaurants are expected to change their menus in order to keep customers interested, Sawa is expected to provide a certain experience and they never fail to deliver. The food is always fantastic and the meat dishes always memorable. Reliability is important and Sawa is just that!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,The service was exceptional and the food hearty and plentiful. It is more like a sports bar or hangout than fine dining. Very reasonable prices.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Visited on a Saturday night without a reservation. The place was packed and initially we were told there is no table, however we got lucky when a table emptied and we were seated in a few minutes. The food was very good, the prices very reasonable, around 10 euro for a main course. The service was good even though they messed up one of the dishes we ordered and served us the wrong dish (but they immediately corrected their mistake and served what we ordered). The belly dancer was excellent and provided good entertainment while dining. Overall great dinner, I would recommend this place",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Went with friends and we left it up to the waiter on what to bring.Started with a variety of cold vegetable dips, then a mix of cold and hot dishes and ended with a platter of shish kebabs and souvlaki. For dessert they brought mahalepi and a syrupy cake. You can, of course, pick and choose whatever you‚Äôd like to order.Service, food, prices, ambiance all very satisfactory and makes for a lighter dinner than with Cypriot meze. Would recommend it just for that.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I have been there twice and both times it was excellent. Nice food, nice people and belly dance every Saturday!!! Also, the best nargile in Cyprus...",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

Then followed grilled chicken, lamb kebab, keima kebab..all soft and yummy!! Highlight of the night - the belly dancer!! Great night out!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"This the first time i have been here and i loved it. What a great environment, very clean with a wonderful decoration, it makes you to forget that you are in Nicosia. The staff was very professional and friendly, but nobody seem to be speaking Greek on the downside. We had meze for two and and the food was great on a very good price. There was also a short belly dance show that we enjoyed. I will definitely revisit.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The food, service and restaurant itself were of a high quality. Felt like I had gone back in ancient times sitting in a beautiful courtyard in the meditteranean. If you are looking for healthy food at a good value this is the place to try out.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"A classier venue than its Syrian Arab Friendship sibling, Sawa's courtyard is great for relaxing dinners with friends and family. Food is consistently good, prices are reasonable and staff is well trained. I frequent this place as it never disappoints me. Try on a Saturday if you appreciate belly dancers!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"visited recently with friends, the Restaurant has it's own private car park, although there are not many spaces, but it will certainly suffice for parking during daytime visits. The Restaurant has a large smart outdoor dining area that is laid out nicely.On entering inside, the first noticeable factor is the air conditioning definitely works, it was like an escape from the scorching Nicosia heat.The interior design is very Syrian, very smart and certainly the type of place for anything from a business lunch to a family evening meal.The staff are very welcoming and the service is great. Recommended.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

10,"Small portions; It was too hot at the restaurant; As I said, it's very expensive; Mostly is served meze;",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Kaizen in Japanese means: ''The practice of continuous improvement'' What has that got to do with A Syrian restaurant I here you say? Well after visiting Sawa on numerous occasions over the years I have come to the conclusion that the owners are very much into ''the practice of continuous improvement''. The place keeps evolving and looks cleaner and more professional each time. The service is always spot on and the food is always excellent.I visited on Friday with my wife, the place was packed and we were warmly welcomed by the manager. After ordering our starters they arrived within 5 minutes accompanied with the wine and fresh pitta. The belly dancer was very good as was the shisha ( brand new). Main course was excellent as was the complimentary desserts and coffee.Even after the bill arrived we were still impressed as they had given us a 10% discount off the bill!! when I asked why, they said they regularly make discounts to large bills. Not that ours was large, the total before discount was ‚Ç¨48. Great value for money and deserves to be higher up the list for Nicosia restaurants.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Excellent in all aspects and most important very friendly staff and great atmosphere which are the first things you will notice once you go there. When it comes to food, was so tasty that i took some notes for the next time i go.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I have been to Sawa restaurant several times, and I enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere every single time. I visit Sawa at least once a month. In my opinion is the ideal place to eat and enjoy an evening with family, colleagues or with your other half.I pay special attention to the cleanness of a place and Sawa is spotless. Either you choose to seat in the luxurious dining room or the veranda the exotic atmosphere will make your dinner even better. Considering the food I am speechless. It is delicious, traditional, with fresh ingredients and always on time. The most worth mentioning aspect of the dining experience at Sawa is the service. People who work there are professionals with very good manners and really passionate with their job.To conclude, Sawa is the place that combines good food, excellent service, oriental atmosphere with very good prices. I am happy that I know a place where they respect their customers and love their job. Strictly recommended if you visit Nicosia.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"We visited Sawa on a Saturday night with some friends for dinner.We were welcomed with a smile and we were seated to our table at no time. Great service and always with a smile.We order the meze option for everyone. Food started coming in no time. We got a couple of salads, many small dishes with traditional syrian sauces, some syrian starters and at the end we got a big plate of the meat variety.I have to say that the salads, sauces and starters were really tasty and we enloyed them. What was a bit disappointing was the meat. Neither the quantity nor the taste were really good. We expected more of the meat so we were a bit disappointed.Overall the experience was good. The belly dancing was really interesting and it kept us amused for quite some time.Service was really good and we didnt have any problems or delays.Food can definitely improve and some additions to the meze can also be done in order to match the price paid.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"The atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant may not be of everyone taste, but they have a good parking area which is very helpful when you go out in Nicosia by car. The food is tasty and the service is very friendly. If you want to change the type of mezze, this would be the place to visit.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Four of us (aged 76 to 11) went on a Saturday night. We didn't have reservations and the downstairs section where the belly dancing takes place was full, but the friendly staff suggested we eat upstairs. Initially we were unsure; the bar played music somewhat loudly, a large but silent TV screen flashed pictures on the wall at the end of the room and people smoked (apparently allowed in Cyprus). But we were hungry and it was getting late so we decided to stay.The menu offered many intriguing choices and we thought we'd try the meze for 4, perhaps adding a couple of Syrian specialties. However, we were advised to have the meze for 3 and told it would suffice.The food arrived... and arrived... and arrived.... just as we thought there couldn't possibly be any more, another delicious dish hot from the oven came. And then another... We thought the meal would never end, and were somewhat embarrassed to come to a stop and leave so much food uneaten.My daughter, who had been to Chios, wanted to try the Syrian ice cream, which contained mastic from there. The ice cream was home made, and described on the menu as requiring beating for 3 hours. We ordered for all of us, and were once again overwhelmed to have three scoops for each serving! Although eating more of anything seemed impossible the dessert was so good that we finished it all, and I was tempted to lick the plate.The bill arrived in a wooden box with the name of the restaurant on it. We paid, and praised the food, the box, the friendly service, and apologised for leaving so much uneaten. Back came the cc and with it two full bags of our uneaten meze, and a wooden box for us to keep. We left with enough food for two meals in our rented house.The lovely woman who helped us is a refugee from Homs, where she still has family. This was the best meal we ate in Cyprus, and just about the best service we've had anywhere.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,I have been a regular since they opened and since the old abu faisal days. They have the best syrian food in cyprus. But they are only great for dinner. Lunch hours the chefs keep dissapointing. Make sure to book for dinner to get a hood seat.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,I just love this place ... specially one of the waiters who dances with the lady during belly dance time. That is just priceless and fun to watch. He is awesome lol,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Been there only once for dinner with a big group of friends and i would love to go again. Whenever i will have relatives from abroad i would definitely take them at Sawa for a nice - non Cypriot cuisine - meal. The garden outside is like heaven! and the belly dancer is a nice entertain. Different than any other restaurant in Nicosia. Food is very nice too. Service amazing!! We were sitting outside and we felt a bit chilly, but they have blankets and they offer them to the customers! nice gesture!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"The food at Sawa is wonderful, fresh, tasty and arrives quickly. The service, although sometimes slow is very friendly. The only thing I can criticise is the belly dancer! She is terrible and she dances one song too many! Also the shisha service is great!!!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,This place specializes in Syrian style meze and mixed grill. The food is really good and we really liked the dining area decorations which gave the restaurant a very nice atmosphere.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Forget about Old Town. Good for coffees but pretty average food in the main street. This place is the answer. Good prices, better food and excellent service. Mezzes are great and grilled meat just delicious. All with affordable prices and a service that was attentive and helpful in choices. Special mention to the syrian coffeee nice alternative to the cypriot one if you feel like trying something new. They provided a box to put the remainings which were enough fpr a dinner. Can't get any happier. No way.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Words cannot do justice to what for me is the best restaurant in Nicosia! Whether it's for a meal with friends, family or your significant other, this is the place to go. Winter or summer the environment there cannot be matched, whether it's outside in the beautiful garden or inside in the opulently decorated interiors, you will feel as if you are in your own little palace. Service is second to none, very attentive smiling staff who will go out of their way to provide you with anything your heart desires. The food is superb, fresh and cooked to perfection from the tantalizing appetizers to the succulent meats. For vegetarians you are spoilt for choice. Friday and Saturday nights there is also belly dancing which is a delight to watch.As for me personally, the Nargile cannot be beaten by Sawa, Josef who is the Nargile specialist at Sawa is amazing, even if it is your first time to visit there, you really have to try it for a true Middle Eastern experience.I have been a regular customer for years and will always highly recommend the restaurant to everybody, indeed I have been there with most of my friends and they all agree, Sawa is the place to be!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

50,"Although i visited this restaurant many many times, it still amazes me. Starting from the food, one word... divine. They serve a variety of Syrian foods and all of them are delicious. We also had the chance to try their sangria which was very nice as well.Top of the pops, some nights they have a belly dancer which makes the atmosphere even more exotic.As for the service, best ever. As soon as our glasses were half empty, a waiter came immediately and filled them up. All of them were very very polite and professional. Regarding the price, they have really good offers and the overall bill amount was very reasonable.Definitely recommended.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Very good food and very good service. We sat outdoors which is nice for this time of the year and we ordered the meze for two. It was a large variety of dips, salads and meats and more, plus their homemade breads. Worth a visit!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Went for dinner with friends. Enjoyed the meze, the shisha but did not get to see the belly dancer show. The place is decent. When it s a bit humid though, might be better to sit inside with the ac rather than out in the yard. Small parking lot, which make it difficult to park when it s a busy night.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"a fantastic oriental design,offering a good tasty choice of mid eastern dishes at around 15 euros per person plus drinks. Service was very prompt and efficient though a major problem is that most of them do NOT speak the local greek language which makes things difficult to explain. Food was tasty, ambience very oriental, service very good. What all of us disliked is the fact that they ignore the strict law for non smoking so smoking is permitted in a closed outside area with a ridiculous excuse, plus the usual smoke of nargile. (water pipe arab smoking). Guests have the right to a clean atmospere without smoke.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The Syrian restaurant chain is one of the most well known and beloved in Cyprus. This place marks itself as not only the best Middle Eastern restaurant in the capital, but also one of the best restaurants overall.The meze is perfect as it delivers quality and quantity at great value. The Arabic food is vibrant and delicious. Bread is made-to-order in the wood-fire oven visible from the outdoor seating area.Service is impeccable, as waiters cater to your every whim politely and enthusiastically.The shisha is one of the best in the city too, and it's worth visiting this place just for a smoke and a coffee.Ambiance is brilliant, both outdoors and indoors.You absolutely cannot go wrong with Sawa. The owners put every effort into making their 3 (or is it 4?) establishments in Nicosia 5-star.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,From the moment we entered the restaurant we knew we were going to receive top quality service.We had our pick of where to sit (smoking and non-smoking is available). Te decor is lovely and truly inspires a Syrian feel. We were served wine (complimentary) the moment we sat down and the waiters were very attentive.The menu was easy to order from with a set menu for those who want to try a bit of everything and the separate dishes for the more experienced diner.The quality of the food was excellent and quantity was very generous. I would suggest that if you order meze get one less for example for 4 people order a meze for 3.We asked for the bill and the waiter encouraged us to stay for the belly dancer and brought us complimentary coffee and sweets. All in all was a lovely evening and I can't fault a single thing. The prices are very affordable. Also note reservations are taken however although busy there is plenty of seating space.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,I have visited the particular restaurant 2-3 times until now. It is in the center of Nicosia so it's easy to find. I like very much the syrian food. My favourite dishes are shish tawouk and falafel. You also have to try the syrian homemade ice-cream. It is amazing.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Amazing food, friendly staff, the whole syrian vibe every is amazing. though avoid getting the set menu, prefer to order individual plates from the vast menu. Must have the Patata Hara and Jobn Bill Pane",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"There is a lovely atmosphere at Sawa and they have really taken great care to make your experience as good as possible.The food is excellent and you can have just a couple of dishes for a snack all the way up to the Arabic ""meze"".Service is very good and the prices reasonable.Over all, a very good dArabic dining experience.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Have been a here a number of times and have never left disappointed. The staff is always happy polite and friendly. They never keep you waiting and you truly feel that they enjoy and appreciate their job. The food is always very well balanced with meat and salads but never too much and wasteful like cypriot taverns. I would highly recommend this place.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Been there a couple of times and we even had a birthday dinner with friends.The place is great during the summer. The outside sitting area is really great for a night out during the hot summer in Nicosia. Food is really good and the service is great. The guyds working there will not stop smiling and they are willng to help and serve.The prices are really good also. Choose the variety of dishes so taht you can have a taste of the traditional cuisine served there.I would definately go back really soon and i highly recommend to others.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant

40,"Syrian dishes are very good at Sawa, fresh and tasty. They have many dips but also a great selection of meats. Nice atmosphere, although the decoration is too much even for a Syrian restaurant. All in all, it is a different place in the heart of Nicosia with a very tasty menu.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Great syrian menu. Prices are ok. Decoration is much much better, compared to the other syrian restaurant in Nicosia (Syrian Arab Friendship). Service is perfect. Very good choice for someone looking for an alternative meal experience..",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,I always enjoy the summer nights in the beautiful garden of Sawa with a tasty rich variation of dishes and wines. I never thought that i will enjoy even more now in the winter.I've been there last night with my friends. From the time we got inside we could feel the magic of coming holidays. The place is so nice decorated!!! The food was great as always and with a glass of wine even better. And of course we couldn't go with out trying their nargile and syrian tea :)I will absolutely go there again and not just once.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Authentic food, friendly staff and a great atmosphere . Furthermore this is the only place I have found in Nicosia that makes Nargyle properly, and does not charge an insane price.Personal favourite dishes are the chicken, moutabal, and the cheese pies.This is a genuine restaurant gauranteed to satisfy those who love their food!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I love the food form Sawa! I tried different places with Syrian/Lebanese food, but this is my favorite. I always go for the meze option because it offers a large variety of dishes with salads (fattoush and tabouleh), dips (hummus, aubergine, spinach, beetroot salad etc), and meats. For this tasty meze the price per person is decent (15 euro ) and you get so much food that you will go home with snacks for the next day.TIP: If you like sour drinks, they make a nice mint lemonade!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"We went with some friends on a Saturday night, we took the meze which we all thought was OK, lots of Middle Eastern pitta bread and some dips, but we thought very short of meat.Part of the attraction was the belly dancer... Who unfortunately couldn't, she was a somewhat overweight embarrassment which instead of enriching the evening proved to be a bad talking point later. Not hers but the management's fault.Pretty good service and fair prices (IF they gave a bit more meat), but not somewhere I'm planning to revisit.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,great efforts from the manager and staff go on all the best the food is excellent every time excellent atmosphere,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Celebrated birthday party in Sawa. Enjoyed everything from organisation, preparation, welcome and attention to the guests to wonderful food, excellent atmosphere and very efficient and friendly service. Lovely interior too.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,We visited Sawa 4 times for dinner with friends. Always the food is very good and the prices reasonable. The outside seating area for summer is great! Try to combinate maze and plates so you will try more types of food.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Thank you TripAdvisor. We found this restaurant using the App while in Nicosia. The food was absolutely amazing and so reasonably priced. The service was also brilliant. We went for lunch but heard that the vibe at night is amazing.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,A good aunthentic calinary experience of the middle east in the heart of Nicosia. Friday and Saturday nights with a belly dancer. Prices are good compared to food quality. There meze its okay however its recommended you make your own meze with your favourite salads and dips and with a huge portion of their tasty meat dishes. You compliment your culinary experience with a unique Arak drink (ouzo) or a good wine.You can finish your experience with a nice sip of coffee and ofcourse a sisha!Recommended for special events or for a casual day out.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The entrance to Sawa is impressive and exotic. The food is excellent as is the wine list. Four of us enjoyed a splendid Syrian meal with excellent wines and service. We chose to have the mese which was varied and very good. I would strongly suggest having the kebabs which are outstanding. A mese for two with some kebabs will be more than enough for four, This restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you come to Nicosia. At the weekends they have belly dancing which is great fun.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"One of our first options for dinning out for a long time! Very good service, friendly, food never disappoints.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant

50,"Umlice the Sirian Frienship Club, SAWA has amazing decoration both inside and out! The food is very good and according to Arabic Cuisin Shefs that ate with me there its almost homemade...The prices are ok and according to the quality and service you get.The service is very good as well, smiling faces always and fast and effisiend. Good variety to choose from, and agood wine list as well.Shisha or Nargile is also available for the lovers of the sport, the only downsite is the absence of variety in tobaco flavors.DON'T forget to try the masticha ice cream!!!!!! Amazing!!!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Nice outdoor veranda, good syrian food and nice service. Love the variety of dishes and a nice place to go to order many small dishes for sharing. Will be coming back!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Overall a very good choice for syrian food lovers. Very nice mahallepi. Need to improve the nargile quality and watch a bit tha food standard.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant

40,nice choice for syrian food little on the expensiv site compared to what they offer environemnet is wwell decoreated nice desserts,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"All part of the ""syrian club"" family (3 restuarants) though my favourite is the original syrian club this is a close second - parkingis behind the restaurant (most people dont realise!) and order mezza and a lebanese mehalabi to finish.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"Sadly, we discovered it just before we left Cyprus, but The Three Mohammeds are super hosts, the meze is great, the wine list is outstanding, and we just had a great time each time we visited. We chose it for our going-away party, and the staff handled our large group with ease.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"Nice place and atmosphere, espacialy in the evening the seating outside is cool. But food is just OK. The sister restaurant has better food",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"The food was tasty. I liked the vegetarian dishes and salads at the beginning of the meze. The meat varieties at the end was also good. good service, nice place.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Sawa is one of my favourite restaurants in Nicosia, you get good Lebanese food with all the fantastic flavours. Meze is a must, especially the minced chicken Kebab is amazing. The whole meze is also very appealing to veggie lovers as I would say 80% is about salads and dips. Good alternative to heavy Cyprus Meze now and then. :)My Opinion: Although the design is a bit on the tacky side the food is good value for money.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Went with friends and we had a great meal. very big portions so dont order too much. plenty of choices and very good service !! it will be a nice nite in lebanese cuisine world.. definatelly recomended,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,The food is nice and I've been there 4-5 times.. I've noticed some mistakes on the bills..and that is every time..is that REALLY a coincedence???,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"I would say it was simply fine. Not thrilled nor hated it. Many options, yet the taste was lacking something I think....kind of blunt...maybe 6 out of 10? Would I go there again? probably not...",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
20,i didnt like the food. i was waiting something else,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I love Syrian and Lebanese food; it was really a lifetime discovery for me when I moved to Cyprus. This place is among the best, excellent, fresh food including amazing, freshly baked bread, good service, reasonable prices, what else you need?",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"I am a big fan of Lebanese and Syrian food and traveled many times to Lebanon, with food guides in my pockets.This restaurant is offering excellent food at excellent price.I am addicted to their moutabbal, my husband and my son to their hoummous and all my kids to their falafels.Their chicken is very tasty, rare enough for chicken to be mentioned.When available, the chanklish is delicious.I often order the kebbe naye (raw meat) and was never disappointed.The patata maklia are fresh and tasty, much better than the fries which are there again, frozen and disappointing.We tried their home made ice cream and enjoyed it very much.I often have a glass of Arak with my meal, which is served in generous portion. My husband opts for beer, which is always really chilled.The bread is freshly baked in the premises.The head waiter is very nice, but it happened we had bad service from one rude guy on some busy nights.Be aware that parking in front of the restaurant is forbidden and you can get a fine. They have a private parking behind. You have to pay 2‚Ç¨ but they refund it with your bill.Definitly a place to recommand, either for romantic evenings, for large company with friends, with the family or for business, I just don't understand why it is not so busy lately on lunches. (thanks to their lunch discount of 20%, the dinner is more than cheap).",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"We enjoyed the cultery that this restaurant serves quite a number of times. If you pay attention to the details, Sawa will not meet your expectations, especially if you are a wine lover who enjoys having wine in big wine glasses. Other than that, the food is tasty, while the guality is standard. Not neglect to taste the home made ice-cream. Such a big plus to the menu.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"good value for money, fresh ingidients, excellent service",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,"we visit Sawa syrian restaurant often,cause i like syrian and lebanese food.We always choose very light but tasty starters and then grill meat.The ""shish taouk"" chicken souvlaki is the best i have ever tried .The salads are also very good .There is a very big variety for all tastes .Also vegeterians can find a big selection there.The decoration and music of the restaurant give you the impression of being in Syria so if you want to try something different ,visit it.It is recently awarded as value for money restaurant at the ''Time out''magazine awards.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Amazing food! Big fan of Sawa in Nicosia i couldnt resist visiting this one! best value for money,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,Really good food at excellent prices...Value for money establishment. Try the masticha ice cream for dessert!,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,excellent food excellent service and the most amazing handmade ice cream in town keep up the good work guys,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"Went twice, in the winter and last month. Variety to chose from, great taste, good service. Chicken in every course is delicious they probably marinate it in herbs. Friendly waiters, I especially liked the decoration, the warm atmosphere and the nice garden outside.The only downside I think it's the quantity for what you're paying. For example, the variety for 22Euros is basically consisted of dips -nice in taste but not a lot. It's better if you order a starter and main course.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,"As a local i would rate this place as average. food is not bad , service is better than other Syrian restaurants, but the quality is not that great. Nicely decorated though.",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
50,Excellent food! The chicken kebab abd the lahmajun are my favorite.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,"large quantity of food, good service, quick service!!",Sawa Syrian Restaurant
30,It took us over 40 minutes to even get a drink in this restaurant.from the sullen waiters. We booked non smoking and they put us in a room with reclining cushions and people smoking water pipes. This would have been quite atmospheric if it were not for the massive tv screen on the wall broadcasting a football match. We moved to a table we could actually sit at in a room which had another tv. The meze was good and reasonably priced apart from the lamb which had been burnt to a cinder and was as hard as concrete.,Sawa Syrian Restaurant
40,i had gone there during octoober n the stuff was really gd; the guy actually offered to pack the food for home:P i was like yeiii:) the food was delicious too:),Sawa Syrian Restaurant
