50,"Amazing food and excellent service!! The pricing is good, especially on Tuesdays which is all-you-can-eat buffet with 20 euro per person.",China Spice
40,Very good food. Nice dishes. Tasty. Some aren‚Äôt available for delivery or take away. Nice atmosphere. The service is really helpful. At a nice area of Nicosia.,China Spice
50,"Excellent service! Excellent food! We visited this place last night,we ordered 5 different dishes.... and all of them were excellent!",China Spice
20,Paid 20 euros for each person to have unlimited food buffet. Food not that great. Dry duck and the rest of the buffet wasnt that great.More like a 12-15 euro buffet.Would prefer to pay 30 euros but eat a better plate of food.Not recommended.,China Spice
20,Service was good but food was very average. Paid 43‚Ç¨ for two people at the buffet (it was unlimited to be fair) but the food was not worth it. Duck was dry and everything else was average. Do not recommend. Perhaps a la carte might be a better choice if you want to try the restaurant.,China Spice
40,We visited the place at around 2h pm and we were the only customers ... the waitress was friendly and the service was very good. The chicken with cashew nuts was ok but the ling shrimps was tasty... the shrimp dumpling was good. The prices are considered as average comparing to other places on average should be around 20 eur per person. We got also at the end 20% discount on our bill. Nice gesture.,China Spice
50,Hi. Visited for dinner a few times always on Tuesdays where they have there all u can eat buffet. Excellent food with a variety of dishes for everyone. Loved the sweet and sour chicken and sweet chilly beef. Nice surpise is the ice cream with fried banana and apple for dessert if u have any room left. Reasonable price of 20 euro pp considering what u are getting.,China Spice
40,Perhaps the best Chinese food in town but not for cheap-eats. My personal favorite is the Cantonese chicken and noodles with vegetables and bamboo shoots. Very elegant and nice ambience but I would say the crowd is quite old people. Other than that perfect,China Spice
50,Very very good food and excellent service. Such a nice atmosphere both for couples and families. I would recommend it to everyone especially to those who love Chinese cuisine.,China Spice
50,The best Chinese food! Super friendly and great service! Quality of food is really nice! For sure come back again,China Spice
50,"Excellent quality , perfect service. The people the re are really friendly and happy to serve you ! The best choice",China Spice
50,"Great restaurant, food was amazing we went on a Tuesday and it was a buffet. I would like to thank Mr Leonithas for his hospitality as we didn‚Äôt pre book and found space for us üëçthanks",China Spice
50,"First time I‚Äôve been to this Chinese restaurant for lunch today and I liked it. Unpretentious decor, simple and light. Food was excellent. Service was fast and polite. Noise from other tables was limited. I didn‚Äôt pay the bill because my sister invited us for lunch but from the menu the prices looked ok - we are in cyprus after all that is extremely difficult to find cheap food. But what really impressed me was that the waiters were putting each plate on the table using a napkin so that bare fingers wouldn‚Äôt touch the plate! I have never seen this before in any Cypriot restaurant and that made me immensely happy. This spells respect for the clients so unreservedly I give it a 5 stars",China Spice
50,My Favorite Chinese restaurant in Nicosia. A little bit expensive side but ideal for more formal outings. perfect for couples and families!!,China Spice
50,My All-Time-Favority chinese restaurant in Nicosia. A little on the expensive side but ideal for more formal outings.,China Spice
50,"Amazing Chinese Buffet, every Tuesday night. Incredible variety of Chinese dishes AND the best duck roll i ever ate. Recommended!",China Spice
10,"Very bad tasting food. We ordered corn soup, noodle soup and duck dumplings. The taste was horrible. The delivery was 40 minutes late.",China Spice
30,"I went there for dinner .. the duck it was tasty but dry , the beef with black beans sos it was so nice and tasty we ordered also spring rolls , rice with egg, sweet chili and one water. The quantity it was so small and I was disappointed because we paid 65 euro for 2 persons and i think it's too much for the quantity of the food . The quality of the food it was okay . The staff it was friendly and always there to help us.",China Spice
40,"As the restaurant is well known to me as a local, we decided with my collegues to have a dinner and specifically on Tuesday which is an all you can eat day. We reserver the table few days before. That day the restaurant was very busy. I can admit that i was suprised to see so many people. We waited for a while until we had our dinner but it worth it. The only thing i didnt like were vegetable noodles that were a bit over cooked.I have a suggestions to management to change the buffet location next to the main door as the current location creates a confusion and might distirb some tables as its too close to them.Thank you we had a lovely dinner and we will visit you again",China Spice
40,"Nice place, clean and modern furnished, stuff helpful and polite. Food was very good,tasty and fresh. I found is overprised as we paid 133 euros for 6 persons and a child,we had one quarter of duck for 21 euro, sreams for 18 euros, a bottle of wine at the price of 16 euros and steam rice for two at the price of 8 euros and some other dishes that were expensive. Anyway we enjoy food and feel satisfied, so we will go again.",China Spice
50,Staff are very friendly and frequently ask for customers‚Äô advice on the new dishes they plan to add. Excellent quality,China Spice
30,"We ordered a home delivery from this restaurant which arrived on time. The chicken and sweetcorn soup was fine.The two pre-wrapped crispy duck rolls, a little soggy and no hoisin sauce supplied. The 4 little chicken satays dry and overcooked, satay sauce a bit of a skinny portion but okay. Cantonese Chicken and Beef with Black Sauce were fine.Egg fried rice and noodles pretty average.At 68 euros im not sure I wood order another one.",China Spice
50,Always fresh and perfectly cooked dishes.new dishes added very delicious.try the new duck salad.only negative the place should be renovated.,China Spice
10,Service was good. Food was dry with an intense smell of the flying oil. The glass of wine was also horrible,China Spice
40,I visited this restaurant on a Friday night. The waiters/waitresses were all very polite. The food is decent but a little overpriced in my opinion.,China Spice
20,"I must say that it is a shame to have a big restaurant which serves decent food but there is no atmosphere. Again, we wanted a romantic dinner just the two of us, but we were surrounded by families with children, screaming, throwing things on the floor etc. I realize that families are entitled to eat chinese too, but the restaurant should reserve some quiet corners for those who want to have an adult evening. Also, the restaurant lacks atmosphere, meaning, it was cold inside, there was no music, so everyone could hear everyone in the restaurant. It was not very pleasant.",China Spice
40,"A very nice place to visit. Tasty food, friendly staff and very good atmosphere. Drink prices are OK but food prices are a bit high. Recommended, especially for special occasions.",China Spice
40,Visited China Spice on the recommendation of a friend and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The food and service were both pretty good. Loved the thin noodles with Shrimps.,China Spice
50,Been coming to this restaurant regularly for more than a decade. When a place which is consistently good keeps improving then it deserves all the praise it receives.Great atmosphere and outstanding & professional service. True that the prices are not cheap but if you want to eat the best then you pay what it‚Äôs worthThe menu is extensive and enriched all the time. If you need any recommendations then don‚Äôt hesitate to ask because you will be pleasantly surprised.I just love their hot & spice soup as a starter with crispy fresh spring rolls.I never eat duck anywhere but their crispy aromatic duck simply melts in your mouth and you will not find it in any other restaurant.Their sizzling dishes compete with each other and it‚Äôs difficult to say which is the best.It‚Äôs always a pleasure to come to China Spice and if you have not done so then you do not know what you are missingEnjoy,China Spice
40,Friendly staf and owner. Made sure we ordered satisfactory and not over the top. Food was what you would expect from a western Chinese restaurant of good quality. Would gladly go again.,China Spice
50,Back home in Cyprus out with good friends. Amazing friendly welcoming staff. Food was Devine. Will for sure visit again,China Spice
50,I‚Äôve been going to this place for years! It is really worth visiting! The same polite staff for 12 years running! New dishes all the time but exquisite quality and taste! Superb service and also delivery! I am a fan and a frequent visitor for the past 12 years! Definitely a Chinese food lovers haven!,China Spice
20,"The food is mediocre. We had the sweet and sour chicken and the beef in black bean sauce. Also got fired rice and vegetable noodles.Portions were small and the chicken was stale, not crunchy. Beef was OK, certainly though, not a 13 Euro dish. Overall, it's like eating Uncle Ben's sauce, leftover from the night before.I had much better Chinese, from street carts in Camden town for much less.",China Spice
50,Amazing food. Amazing decoration. Amazing sevice. Good prices. Variety of chibese food. THANK YOU!!!!!!üòçüòçüòçüòç,China Spice
40,"Nice restaurant, nice environment, friendly staff. Personally I enjoy the duck it's tasty and aromatic.",China Spice
50,This is one of the best chinese restaurants in Nicosia. the food is great and the prices for the quality and service is reasonable. very friendly staff!,China Spice
50,"one of the best Chinese restaurants in town! Clean, fresh and tasty food. For dine in and also delivery!",China Spice
50,went with a group of friends. very satisfied from both the tastes and the quantity of the food :) selection of dishes was done by the staff and we shared. will return for sure!,China Spice
50,Exellent food.. :) good prices.. very friendly staff.. fast service :) i love it ‚ô° try it is the best restaurant,China Spice
30,My wife and I weary from the incredible daily heat were very blessed as we entered the restaurant. Lovely and cool decor very nice - a little 'poshed up' and the service was really good and efficient. We had crispy duck and a couple of other dishes nothing really to write home about almost bland - there are better venues for better cooked food.,China Spice
40,"Visited for Sunday lunch.... we were the first customers of the day and it never really got busy which meant great service!! The food menu has all the Chinese dishes we are familiar with a list of new dishes to try. The service was quick and polite, ready to make dish recommendations. The food was tasty and fair size portions. Try the Chinese beer on offer - very refreshing!! Pricing a little high and you may find yourselves paying between 70-80 euro for a meal for two with an alcoholic drink each!!",China Spice
50,"Food was very nicely prepared, imaginative and the portions were just the right amount. the service was amiable, quick and efficient. the d√©cor and atmosphere were very relaxing and you could tell the place is run by experienced professionals.",China Spice
50,"Excellent food quality and perfect customer service. This is a restaurant for those who appreciate the Chinese cuisine. All plates are delicious. Pricy? A little bit, but it worths every euro you spend. Go visit that restaurant, taste any plate you desire and you won't regret it. You will definitely come back. Probably one of the best, if not the best Chinese restaurant in town.",China Spice
50,The food was very good and the quantity very satisfactory. The food was original chineese food and the duck whioch is my favourite one of the best I have eaten.,China Spice
40,"We ordered take away on a busy night and even though there was a confusion with our order and we were about to leave empty-handed, it was sorted out 15 minutes later. The Peking duck was great as well as the sweet and sour chicken. An overall safe choice.",China Spice
50,I guarantee and i approve that is the best Chinese restaurant in town!! I visit it very often whenever I can and I will highly recommend you to goüñí,China Spice
30,"Soups are good, starters are good, mains are average-to-good. Vegetarian fare is good. Overall an average-good restaurant in terms of food quality but with great service. Expensive.",China Spice
50,"We loved the new dishes especially the new prawn starter which is served on small individual dishes. Out of this world! We also tried the new duck salad, with orange segments which was fantastic! The quality of this restaurant is superb! I have eaten many a times in some of London's best chinese and I can say it competes with honours. The service is always very friendly and attentive. One of our old time favourites in Nicosia.",China Spice
20,"I ordered delivery from China Spice as knew they had nice food and to my surprise it was the worst Chinese food i ever had.Duck was ok but sweet and sour chicken, lemon chicken and the rest were inedible..I paid 50 euro and i regretted every cent.Unless they change i will never eat there again!",China Spice
40,We really enjoyed our dinner at China Spice the other night! All of the dishes we ordered were very well cooked and presented. The service was excellent too. It's an expensive restaurant but it is worth it.,China Spice
10,I ordered for delivery noodles with 3 kind of meat. First they bring me noodles with only vegetables instead. After waiting another 30min my order came but... the noodles with 3 kind of meat was boiled noodles with boiled chicken and 2-3 pieces of beef. Nothing else...It was smelling disgusting!!!,China Spice
40,"China Spice is considered as the most prestigious of Chinese restaurants and for good reason. Granted, at a minimum of 27 euros per head, it is not cheap, but if you can afford it or in anyway choose to indulge yourself, it is for great Chinese dishes. The staff is experienced and courteous and the service highly professional.There is a selection of mild and hot dishes for starters, main or to share. Personal favorite starters include Crispy Aromatic Duck, Salt & Pepper Squid, and Crispy Seaweed. Whatever main you choose, the fried bananas and apples with ice cream are a must to finish off the evening.Highly recommended for business, family and friend dinners!",China Spice
50,"The food was divine, the service was absolutely first class. Just try some of the new dishes. Superb crispy duck, marinated in five spices sauce with mixed vegetables and delicious dumplings!",China Spice
30,"Have only had takeaway from here that has been OK, if a little ""out-of-the-jar"" food. Prices are OK and the portions good, if a little lacking sometimes in quantity of meat.",China Spice
50,"If you want to know what real Chinese food taste like, this is the place. Anything else is just fake Chinese food. I walked in and the aroma of the restaurant smells like a real Cantonese restaurant. The portions are huge so do not order too much. If you do, just packed the rest home for the next meal. Great food, great staff. Yums. I will go back to try the fried fish with black mushrooms in spicy x.o sauce, soon.",China Spice
50,"New additions to menu giving more choice, excellent food with right flavors, good friendly service , warm atmosphere . A must visit.",China Spice
30,Our latest experience confirmed the impression we had on this restaurant. Good and fresh ingredients but rather weighty flavors and heavy on the oil. The prices are definitely on the high side and definitely in need of a restoration.,China Spice
50,Excellent Chinese restaurant in Nicosia. Very clean and fresh food. Friendly and helpful staff with excellent service and fresh food. My favorite in Nicosia and probably the only one in the city with this high standards. Congratulations to everybody. Very well done guys.,China Spice
50,"Cozy and warm atmosphere, the staff is brilliant and the food excellent. The whole experience just EXCELLENT.",China Spice
50,"This has been our favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant since it opened quite a few years ago. The food is fresh, the service attentive and the restaurant is clean and welcoming. We enjoy traditional dishes such as the Crispy Aromatic Duck, chicken satay with peanut sauce and beef with black bean sauce. We have tasted and some new dishes! I suggest Garlic prawns with broccoli and green pepper. Amazing! The owner, Mr. Christos always make us feel at home.",China Spice
50,"Clean, clean, clean. Good, delicious food, Wine list üëç Easy menu Staff: üëç Exellent service Best around me!!",China Spice
50,I regularly order takeaway from China Spice with work and the food is always warm and of good quality.,China Spice
50,Once again China Spice came up trumps for a party of 15 colleagues last week. The Tasting Menu lunch was exquisite (hail to the chef) and the service friendly but discreet. Many thanks to Christos and Andreas for making it a special occasion. Wish more Nicosia restaurants were as good as this one.,China Spice
40,i have been there several times the food is quality and quantity is above average the service realy good but the price per person is on the high side.The atmosphere is pleasant.,China Spice
30,"It is an average Chinese restaurant, not bad at all yet nothing to remember. I think is the best chinese restaurant in Nicosia though",China Spice
40,Very nice food and good service. Nice decoration and atmosphereDefinitely go there to eat again someday.,China Spice
40,"One of the best Chinese restaurant in Cyprus! Top quality of food,of service, it's a really must go place.",China Spice
50,"Although the restaurant could be considered a little more pricy than other Chinese restaurants, this in my opinion is the best in Nicosia. Highly professional staff, the food is always cooked to the highest standard and the environment is excellent. One of my favourites especially for special occasions! Highly recommend, but make a booking as it is very popular!",China Spice
40,"Very good chinese food. Love the peking duck with pancakes and the beef with black bean sauce. Attentive staff and lovely atmosphere. Do not miss the fried bananas at the end. Good wine list. The only drawback is that it is a bit overpriced for Cyprus. On saturdays you should reserve beforehand. All in all, it's still the best choice for chinese food in Nicosia.",China Spice
30,"Pick your food carefully and you will be alright, it might mean a quieter restauarnt but last time on a saturday lunchtime it was quite busy. If you go at lunch time excluding sunday you get 20% off everything including the wine and when you see the prices that helps. Portions are large so be warned you would only need one beef hotpot between 4 of you with 2 more main dishes to be happy. Splash out on the salt and peper prawns/and duck spring roll starters.",China Spice
50,"delicious Chinese cuisine, delicate flavours cooked to perfection,outstanding service in pleasant surroundings.",China Spice
40,"Truth be told, not many choices exist for chinese food in Nicosia; this place is still my #1 choice. All these years the quality is kept stable, at high level. I don't usually go for lunch because, let's face it, nobody wants to go to a place and be the only table around; people tend to go for dinner instead.It is a bit expensive in general, I don't mind as long as they keep the quality at high level.",China Spice
50,"If you want quality Chinese food and an ambient environment than you have to go to China Spice. It really is very special, minimalist d√©cor, slightly over pampering staff, but very polite at all times. The food is to die for, and Crispy aromatic duck, seaweed and selection for two, as well as Steak with pecan nuts are all a must, as well as the Salt and Pepper prawns, beef with black bean sauce, there really is sooooo much choice. Every time my friends from the UK are in town, it's the first place we visit as they rank it higher than some of the best Chinese restaurants in London. I would highly recommend it.",China Spice
50,"I usually judge the quality of a Chinese restaurant by its Hot & Sour soup. I can tell you it was amazing! The hot duck dish with coriander unique. The chilli prawns with nuts were wow especially if you like spicy food! As for desserts, loved the fried bananas & apples. A must go if you appreciate good Chinese food. And very courteous waiters. Will definitely go back!",China Spice
50,"I visited this restaurant several times. Amazing food, friendly envirnment, very good service, clean and tidy, and good location (easy to find it). They also deliver at home. Deinitely recommended.",China Spice
20,"Been there in the past for a dinner with my wife. Was quite good at the time. But when we returned a couple of months ago we weren't that happy.Service is what it is... Not that professionals but they make you feel comfortable and have a chat with them if you want to.Our major disappointed last time we visited was the food. Everything felt undercooked, meat, chicken etc. Prices are quite high, and you would expect some food quality when paying a premium.Anyway, it seems that Chinese/Asian cuisine is not a Nicosia special and it's disappointing to see places that have been around for that long lose their quality.",China Spice
30,"I am a bit confused about what to say for this restaurant. We visited this restaurant after a friend's referral. The restaurant is tidy and the staff over-friendly (lacked a bit of professionalism in my opinion).Right after we placed our order, the manager (?) came suggesting that we ordered a lot of duck so he suggested ordering 1/6 instead of 1/4 (Which was very kind of him cuz this would save us a bit). But then, as we have ordered chicken with cashew nuts he said that this specific dish is not very nice and that he ll bring us something else (a sizzling chicken dish which was more expensive! thankfully it was tasty).We ordered an appetizer starter which consisted of 5 different appetizers which reminded more of indian cuisine rather than chinese. The most delicious one was the seaweed which was veeeery tasty. The duck was also veeeery delicious and the 1/6 portion was enough for 2 people (3 pancakes each). The sweet&sour pork as well as the mixed fried rice were also very tasty, the sauce was very light and smooth. All the dishes came quite early, no long wait at all.The bill was 70 euros for the above mentioned with a bottle of water and a soft drink which i believe is a bit too much for 2 people.If i would go back again? I am not very sure,unless am in the mood of spending.",China Spice
40,"China Spice offers a great city centre setting for real authentic Chinese food cooked by Chinese people. The staff were friendly, however there was a bit of a long wait between ordering and receiving the dishes. Nevertheless, the food was great and the menu has a huge selection. The atmosphere wasn't great due to only one other family being there, however it does get busier later on.",China Spice
30,"We went for a family meal to China Spice on Christmas Eve. The food was good and the waiter friendly and helpful, despite having to apologise for a very long delay between ordering and the dishes appearing on the table. It seems that the kitchen was having trouble keeping up with the numbers that night. Would still go again but would hope not to have to wait so long.",China Spice
20,this was our choice to hang out with family in summer. the food was okay but totally did not deserve such a good price. chairs were not very comfortable and table had stains in many places. the food was served after a long time in very small portions and the bill was just insane. after the dinner some of the family members took something from a fast food in the area becaise they were still hungry. not recommened.,China Spice
20,"The food was tasteless and the sauces tasted cheap and sugary. Although the service is quite good, you feel overwhelmed by the number of waiters serving your table. For the standard of food that we receives, the price is very expensive. I don't reccomend!",China Spice
50,"This is not a value for money restaurant but you will enjoy great food in generous portions (i've had the orange duck). Very friendly service and all in all, you will enjoy your dinner there.",China Spice
50,"Simple the very best Chinese food in Nicosia. Great atmosphere, friendly service and constistent quality.",China Spice
40,"Nice Chinese restaurant. Close to city centre. service is good, quality for food is good. Think is the best Chinese restuarant in Nicosia. Not consider as value for money.",China Spice
40,"Went last Sunday 22Sept lunch. A group of 3 adults 2 kids 7+9. We were the only table. Felt a bit awkward and started thinking whether a chef was present or whether we would be served microwaved Chinese with corn flour sauces to get the richness. Used to be a fan of China Spice in its early years but not recently as we turned more into Japanese fusion et al.I am glad to say that this was as good Chinese as you can get anywhere in Cyprus with the exception of the Chinese located at 4 Seasons hotel on Limassol.The salt n pepper squid was freshly fried, with the right sweet chili garlic and salt. Crispy aromatic duck was as churchy and tasty as it was 10 years ago at this restaurant. Main dishes included sizzling beef with oyster sauce, prawns with lobster sauce, noodles with 3 kinds of meat and egg fried rice. Writing this has just made me hungry again. Only dish that needed that extra punch of salt was sweet n sour chicken. Otherwise everything was deli. Service was exclusive of course since we were only people there. However, since quality of service is a word that the restaurant industry in Cyprus just doesn't get I would like to point out that the Philippino Greek speaking waitress was immaculate and so was the Greek waiter gentleman. Hey, they even treated us with fried banana and ice cream in the end courtesy of the restaurant. Employees of the month? Yes! Best Chinese in town?Yes! Not cheap of course but worth it.",China Spice
30,I went there with a friend. They already had the prawn crackers on the table and they got moist. The kitchen was very slow and the price just killed us.,China Spice
50,"I went there with friends and the food was delicious i loved it, but it was quite pricy. Its probably my favourite chinese restaurante",China Spice
30,"Nicosia does not have many chinese restaurantsChineSpice is one the good ones but the service is always slow and the kitchenwe had to wait 10 minutes for the waiter to get our orderdrink came after 15 minutes, the first dishes after 30 minutes and the main dishes after 60 minutesit was very disappointing",China Spice
50,"Hands down best Chinese restaurant in Cyprus. Not easy to find a good Chinese restaurant in Cyprus, and China Spice is by far best I have tried. Service is great (which is not the norm in Cyprus), beautiful environment, and most importantly great food, with more than the usual selection of dishes. Very easy recommendation for anybody looking for a Chinese restaurant in Cyprus.",China Spice
50,"best dinner everExcellent value, massive portions and friendly staff.Chine Spice is my favorite Chinese Restaurant. In fact, it is about the only place I will get chinese food from. I have been eating there since they opened. I tried other chinese restaurants but I still think Chine Spice is the best. Their food is excellent. You can get in and out on your lunch hour with no problem.",China Spice
50,Excellent quality and a lot of dishes to choose from. Some spicy dishes to choose from and new dishes are added,China Spice
50,"This is an exceptional authentic Chinese for Cyprus in fact the best with exceptional service, the onus being on the freshly cooked food with great spices catering for all palettes, an excellent wine choice superb for business meals but also that special occasion event. A no rush policy, so one is able to sit and savor the dishes. With all dishes freshly made we were a group of 4 with 2 of us liking hot and spicy and 2 preferring slightly more subtle dishes, but the dishes were all so good that we were constantly trying each others. Highly recommend the Chilli dipping sauce and the Peking Duck. Highly recommend for any occasion.",China Spice
40,"China spice is a high end restaurant with excellent service. Before the crisis you would be lucky to get a table at the weekend without booking. The food, if you choose it to be, is amazingly spicy for the Mediterranean. The waiters are very helpful and will explain each dish to you should you ask. The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I would particularly recommend asking for the superb chilli, coriander and garlic dipping sauce which is splendid. One small niggle was the chopsticks which were rather horrid cheap affairs, I noticed that very few diners used them so I do think the restaurant could produce something more fitting to the quality of the food. Acid test though ... Yes I will be coming back",China Spice
50,"Excellent quality of cooking, satisfactory quantity, limited variety and a little bit expensive, very good service....",China Spice
50,"Finally, and after so many years we discovered an authentic high quality Chinese restaurant in Nicosia.The moment you enter the restaurant you are welcomed warmly to a very stylish, clean and nicely decorated place (although it is not looking Chinese; but we would rather have good Chinese food, than nice Chinese d√©cor and lousy food).We were very impressed with the service and cleanliness; especially changing plates and cutlery frequently, holding them with a serviette.You cannot try all the Menu items in one or even 10 visits; but you should never miss the Hot and Sour Soup, the Starter Selection, the Prawns with Black Bean Sauce, the Special Fried Rice and last but not least the Toffee Apple and Banana with Vanilla Ice Cream.",China Spice
50,"One of the best chinese restaurants on Nicosia (and there are not many!).It's a more formal restaurant, with an excellent combination of food and service and the prices are acceptable. Most of the staff are professionals and they make you feel comfy.It's an excellent choice!",China Spice
40,"It's the only place we go to for Chinese in the capital. The food is generally very good, for Cyprus that is, and the service is fast, though at our last visit the waiting staff was not up to the usual standard.The only criticism I would make is about the prices. It does bother me a bit that you can get much better Chinese food in the center of London for about half the cost.",China Spice
30,"The best Chinese you could in Nicosia,yet it is not always up to standard.some times is excellent and other times is very disappointing (the food).The ambience is average, the waiters are very friendly yet some times over attending .",China Spice
50,"Considered one of the fancier restaurants in the city, it rises up to expectations. You pay a bit more but the service is excellent, the atmosphere pleasant and the food delicious. Prefer it every time.",China Spice
50,this is one of the best chinese restaurants in Nicosia.the food is great and the prices for the quality and service is reasonable.very friendly staff!!the place is very elegantly decorated.its also recommended for business.dont miss to order the fright bananas at the end with a scoop of vanilla icecream... yami..... :),China Spice
