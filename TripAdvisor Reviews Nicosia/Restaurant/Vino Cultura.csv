50,"Dear friends, I am back. I have not visited this place for a few years and I am kicking myself for this. This place is unbelievable as well as perfect. Food was sensational, service was faultless and I am definitely coming back. Enough said. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!",Vino Cultura
40,Great food to share and an extensive wine list to match. It’s always busy at the weekends with a great atmosphere making it the perfect place for a small group of friends to gather.,Vino Cultura
50,"Love this place, really delicious wine and great tapas. The halloumi croquettes are amazing! Service is friendly and welcoming.",Vino Cultura
40,"It has been several years since I have visited this place. It was Saturday night and therefore very busy, but the service was very good, fast and attentive. The food is good - there is some innovation here that I particularly liked. Very extensive wine list although I would have liked to see few more quality Cyprus wines there.",Vino Cultura
50,"Consistent, food is always good and has a nice selection, service friendly and attentive, nice setting with nice people around, always busy. Good for any day of the week.",Vino Cultura
30,"Setting is nice, good for drinks and snacks, disappointing on food which comes over-priced, low on variety, average on quality",Vino Cultura
50,Visited when they had a wine tasting event with Greek wines followed by a dinner for which booking was required and I was thrilled. The wine tasting event was wonderfully organized and everyone was kind and willing to help. Also wines could be found at very good prices during the event. The dinner was just superb and only for 30 euro per person. Lived everything in the set menu but the ravioli and the bon-filet were simply amazing!,Vino Cultura
40,"This was a night out with family, and one we wanted to be special. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the staff attentive and professional. In addition to courteous service, they are open to share insights on wines and food, a nice treat for people who enjoy this sort of think.Overall a very enjoyable experience and evening but it is fair to say that this is not for the budget conscious!",Vino Cultura
50,"Excellent food and wine selection, yet service is where they stand out the most. Very knowledgeable service staff when it comes to wine suggestions and they have a wine shop where you can buy the same wine straight after dinner for a very reasonable price. After living in Nicosia for a year now and testing many places, we keep coming back here - indeed #1 in the city.",Vino Cultura
40,"I visited Vino Cultura with friends a lot of times over the years. Always the wine list is great, with a lot of choices for wines in reasonable prises. The food is very good, especially the tappas.",Vino Cultura
40,"Good food coupled with an extensive range of wines. My only concern is that there are wines from certain countries that are not included in the extensive list available and there are certainly cheaper wines that are also very good, but that are not present on the wine list.",Vino Cultura
50,"A place that has been here for many years and not only keeps its quality but also improves. Has a large variety of wines and the food which is mainly for sharing concept is fantastic. I would definately recommend for friends,couples or business meetings",Vino Cultura
30,"The food and wine were really good, but the man at the entry was so pretentious it was insulting. The music is super loud, making it hard to have a conversation. It's a pity as this place has a great potential. Maybe they are a bit too snobby as a result of their success, but things change... careful not to scare the customers away!",Vino Cultura
50,Great food in good prices and the best live music accompanying... Suggested to everybody who wants a night out drinking good quality wine. Will visit it again for sure!,Vino Cultura
40,Very good choices of wine and nice finger food.Just be aware that if you are looking for a place to have a “normal” dinner (I mean in quantity and choice) this is not the place. You go here for enjoying good wine accompanied with good choice of finger/tapas food.,Vino Cultura
50,"Visited with some friends for an early apéro and ended up drinking cocktails, getting not just a tasting menu but a selection of other dishes and continuing with wine.Staff is very well trained, very good selection of wines and food is very good too. Will be back",Vino Cultura
50,Very good value for money✔️We tried the Tasting menu for 2. This included 7 amazing dishes with dessert as well. The lobster ravioli was absolutely delicious and the chicken with vegetables was perfection! We had the chocolate moose as a dessert which was simply splendid Truly good quality of food! However there was no AC inside which made the experience a little uncomfortable as it was quite hot... Nevertheless would definitely come back!!,Vino Cultura
50,I recommend this fine establishment which has a lovely ambiance and a wonderful tapas and wine selection!,Vino Cultura
50,"Slightly out of the centre of Nicosia, near the old English cemetery, this is a local gem that combines wine bar with tapas. A superb range of wines is available & the nibbles complement the drink well. This is a very popular haunt with limited space, so booking or going early is recommended. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxing and the music great. Break away from the usual touristy routine and enjoy a local experience.",Vino Cultura
50,"One of the best Cava in Nicosia . Wide selection of drinks in the right temperature ( rare for Nicosia ). Also the food , tapas type is of high quality . Price is reasonable but not cheap .Highly recommended",Vino Cultura

40,"The atmosphere was great mainly for couples ... I liked the ambiance. The food was ok, we ordered different kind of tapas and tacos. The salad with halloumi cheese (local geese) was good. The prices comparing to quality are regular. They have large wine list too. The service was ok too. Nice place to be With friends, couples etc",Vino Cultura
50,"You simply can't fail with this place. The variety of wines and delis, the cuisine, the ambiance and the most of the times jazzy music, make it worth every single dime. Just excellent! Keep it up!",Vino Cultura
50,Vino Cultura is a very trendy place popular for both friendly gatherings and informal business dinners. It has an amazing selection of top class wines from around the world at very resonable prices ! As it operates as a wine shop the dring- in wines are only slightly marked up as compared with the take out price. The food is mainly tapas with a Cypriot twist as well as having other options such as very nice steaks.,Vino Cultura
50,"Excellent service, wide range of wine list, and very nice food. The night we visited it had live jazz band, just the right music , to enjoy a good class (or bottle) of wine",Vino Cultura

40,"Very nice and big variety of wines! The atmosphere and the ambience of the place is ok, its not romantic but its a good place for friends to hang out !Service is average, a bit snobbish i would say. If you're not a regular or if you get a bit lost in the huge variety of wines ( most people probably would ), waters will looke doun to you, eaven making you look guilty.Food is good but a bit overpriced, if you get one of the combos you pay for every person but you still get the same amount of food, wich is a bit weird!Overall not bad, and its always there if you have nowhere eals to go !",Vino Cultura
50,"The best wine bar in Nicosia. Nice food, excellent service, right atmosphere and the best of all a big variety of good wines. Sommelier has always something good to suggest. Definitely is the place to be to enjoy a good wine.",Vino Cultura

40,Excellent wine variety and Great atmosphere! Very good service and food! Value of money! Worth visiting!,Vino Cultura
50,We have a weekly meeting there nearly every Sunday. The repetition means we like the place and we get an excellent service. There is a very wide wine selection from many countries and many times have special offers. The staff are very knowledgeable of the wine selection and would always recommend. The food selection is also very good. The atmosphere most times is very festive also and enjoyable.,Vino Cultura
50,A great place with huge variety of wines like no other place in Cyprus and with a unique taste of bites...highly recommended!!!,Vino Cultura
40,"Friendly service, great wine selection - tapas about as good as it gets in Cyprus. Don’t expect Barcelona but you will find something you like.",Vino Cultura

40,Visited Vino Coultura with my wife and couple friends- excellent wine list to choose from; polite staff; and delicious food plates for sharing over drinking wine and talking!!! Nice atmosphere- will visit again for sure!!!,Vino Cultura
40,"In the center of nicosia, no view around but very elegant placeOK for parking if you drive thereVariety of different wine bottles as it is a Cava to buy wine alsoFood is very tasty but smalll portionsDon’t go there very hungryAnyway, good for a night out for “cheese and wine”",Vino Cultura
30,"Last week we visited the place for the 4th time in a couple of years. Called to make a reservation but was told that they didn’t have a table. Went anyway to seat at the bar, and found a couple of free tables, and were invited to seat.Ordered the mushrooms, the philly sandwich and a couple of other dishes, and a bottle of red wine. Despite the place having a huge selection of wine bottles, their wine by the glass selection was limited and we were quite disappointed.Overall, the food was average but quite expensive, and the wine was quite overpriced. Not a bad experience, but not a great one either.",Vino Cultura
50,"This is a wine bar with fundamentals. It is not only a wonderful place with great ambiance and decent music, but it is also a very worthy tapas bar. The wine selection is vast and the tapas dishes, are very tasty, aside a couple of them that did not meet my requirements. The meat tapas is much better than the fish tapas so that's a note to take into consideration. Even if other wine bars have opened in town since Vino Cultura made its debut, I still count it as the finest with the most essence.",Vino Cultura
40,"Very nice place, well designed, cosy, nice atmosphere, elegant, polite staff, not too loud not too quiet ! As to the negative side, a bit expensive in terms of not wine products. I am not a wine expert so i wont comment on the price of wine (it's a matter of choice) but we got a cheese platter which costs 22euros, a bit overpriced in my opinion. Anyway for 2 bottles of rose wine, a bottle of water and a cheese platter we paid in total 73euros.",Vino Cultura
50,Loved the finger food! Especially the salad with figs. Great Malvasia wine! Good choice of music. I prefer to book outside on the high tables.,Vino Cultura
50,"Had a dinner at this restaurant, first off the staff are friendly and the food was excellent, every single dish was perfect and I tried the toffee covered mushrooms it was an great dish, if ever in Nicosia I recommend going there worth every cent made for a wonderful meal",Vino Cultura
50,Indeed very good wine. Ask to reserve a table IN THE cellar. It is more private and it is an excellent experience to eat and drink whilst you are surrounded by hundreds of bottles of fine wine.,Vino Cultura
50,"I went there for a dinner with my girlfriend and we were really impressed in every aspect. In terms of service, it really was extraordinary and the manager made us feel welcomed. The food also beat our expectations, I did not expect it to be that good. I recommend to get the Set Menu in order to enjoy a lot of small plates (Tapas), especially if you are hungry. You pay a little higher than the average restaurant, but it really deserves every penny.Some things I would like to recommend to the owner and/or chef of Vino Cultura:1) I found the portion of some plates quite small. This is not a problem if you get the set menu, but individually I believe it is. I am not disappointed at all, but I think they could be a little bit bigger (e.g. octopus)2) In my opinion ceviche should be cured/marinated a little longer in citrus juices in order to get the texture right. Other than that, I enjoyed this plate to the maximum!3) Orzo should have been cooked 0.5-1 minute less. Again it was fantastic as it was.4) It would be nice to update your menu provided online in order to match the actual menu on site.5) Please don't take my comments/recommendations as bad. I really believe that by making these changes you could make the best dinner experience. Wish you all the best :)",Vino Cultura
50,I was excited by the great and fast service. Quality food and excellent wines. I will definitely come back!,Vino Cultura
40,Nice place to just chill and have a good time... Wine is just fab and the atmosphere amazing. Would definitely recommend this venue.,Vino Cultura
50,"Being a Limassol fan, Nicosia can seem dull, urban, sizzling hot & stuck up.However after work wine with dinner on a Tuesday was impressive! Super wines (although none from South Africa but ok lets be patient), especially a Savignon Blanc served by the glass. Divine.Dinner was excellent. Sharing plates with a friend, delicious vegetarian options and wow we were too full to finish 1 salad and 3 tapas plates.Nice ambience, relaxing yet upbeat vibe, good lighting for a wine bar and service. The Manager was Top. Friendly, talkative, knowleagable, classy.Can't wait to go back! Whether it be with the girls, my partner, a professional meeting, all highly appropriate & fun.",Vino Cultura
50,"I am from Nicosia and I always come here when I want to have quality food with a good pair of wine.. Seriously, nothing like Vino Cultura!",Vino Cultura

50,Great salads and pizza! As for the place it is really unique and like no other wine bar i ve ever been. Really friendly and helpful personel!,Vino Cultura
50,"Out of all the wine bars/restaurants i have been to, this one takes the gold medal. From first class service (which is unique in Cyprus) to attention to detailed food, an immense selection of great quality wines and to top it all off... the staff know about the products they are selling. You do not find this in Cyprus and the times i have been there, everything remained over and above average. At one point i thought they may have dropped the ball by not admitting to a mistake made within the kitchen, they came through, worked as a team and made it up to their guest. And again, not often you get the waiter, chef as well as manager admitting to a mistake and not blaming you for finding a fault... Well done guys, keep on the great team work...this one is a keeper :)",Vino Cultura
50,The place is just one of the best restaurants in the city... nice food... wines from all over the world and actually u can buy wines from there to take with u... amazing host and very good knowledge about wines by Andreas the sommelier of the place and everyone from the staff so friendly and polite.Tottaly worth it and should try it I recommend it 100%,Vino Cultura
50,"Dined here on a few occasions and I must admit that each time it gets better and better,Excellent Food served always with a smile from the lovely staff,Great atmosphere and a huge selection of interesting wines from all over the world,definitely worth a visit if you are a food lover,my advice would be to go,sit back and relax and let the very knowledgeable Sommelier Andréas take you on a journey of matching food and wine with a interesting twist! Thank you Vino Cultura Team once again..you nailed it!",Vino Cultura
40,"I have been going to this place for years.It’s a great wine bar... Prices are on the upper end especially food wise. The large cheese platter is a bit of a joke... if you breath in too hard, the cheese is gone before your friends could have a piece.Wine selection is one of the best in Cyprus.Idea to the owner:Would be great to have like a VIP wine club card were you would get invited to special tastings and gets special discounts etc.",Vino Cultura
50,"Huge variety of drinks and spirits, really friendly personel, huge variety of cheese and meats , must visit!",Vino Cultura
50,"Visited the place during a Greek wine tasting. I met Greek winemakers, tasted their wines and then we had a great meal. Everything was perfect and I actually loved ravioli and the salmon plate. I will definitely visit them again.",Vino Cultura
50,"This is the best wine bar in Cyprus. It has the most extensive wine list that includes the top notch brands and vintages in the wine world. The Tapas are innovative excellent and make a harmonious perfect match with wines. The big surprise are the staff and the owners of the bar, true wine lovers and professionals, that they bring out all their effort to satisfy you. What about the music? If you like Jazz-Blues visit the place on Thursdays! Live music with one of the best Jazz bands in the Island. Mood-Indigo!I",Vino Cultura
40,"Nowadays, one of the prominent winebars of town, although located on a busy street, the relaxing ambience and carefully decorated spaces, give you a different impression. A great variety of wines and also wine tasting events, and good quality fingerfood, tapas and other dishes to accompany.",Vino Cultura
40,"A fantastic experience with the a great producer Louis Latour . 4 whites and 2 top reds. Combination of food and wine almost perfect. The atmosphere in the private space , cellar, was excellent for the occasion. Cheers to Andreas and the big Louis Latour family",Vino Cultura

50,"We were visiting friends who live in Nicosia and they took us here. I really liked the place. We sat up on stools at a table. I didn't see the wine list but as this is a wine bar it is a place to go for wine I am sure. My host just ordered his 'usual' Brunello Di Montalcino, well how could you go wrong! It was so good we had 2 bottles!The food was really tasty, they do a great choice of tapas and sharing platters. Just order a load, put it in the middle of the table and tuck in.The service was very good and very friendly, I would go back here without a doubt.",Vino Cultura
40,A variety of good wines to choose. Food is nice but a little bit overpriced. Good service. On a Thursday you can also enjoy a live jazz band.,Vino Cultura

50,"Friends evening out. Lovely Argentinian Rose wine with amazing salad, various tapas and deserts which were just delicious, escorted with lovely music. Very friendly, polite and helpful staff. A must visit!",Vino Cultura
40,"We visited with a group of five on a quiet night. We ordered our wine and some tapas. The wine was amazing, and the staff was very helpful, but the food was nothing special. The atmosphere of this place is very nice and the lighting gives a sense of a very classy place.",Vino Cultura
50,nice place to have a glass of wine and relax with backround music! it serves quality and highness! i really relax there and had a great discussion with good friends!,Vino Cultura
40,"We were a party of 3. We had 5 tapas and a salad. All of them were great.The girl who served suggested the wine after we decided what to eat. She explained great the taste of each one. Very polite.I liked the place, suggesting it, will go again",Vino Cultura

40,"I visited the place for some business dinner in May. The wine list is quite good, the salads as well. We got a few more dishes and we had an overall good night!",Vino Cultura
50,"A very rewarding experience! First was impressed with the personell. They gave me the impression that they love their job in this place. Very helpful to help us decide what to have. Never needed to call them, always there! Personell seems to be working in harmony between them. The food was more than i expected, fresh and very tasty! You just can't go wrong dining in this place!",Vino Cultura
50,Very nice place for wine and quite dinner with friends or business associates. The staff is quite helpful. The shop has a great variety of wines,Vino Cultura
40,"Vino Cultura is considered as one of the best wine bar restaurants in Nicosia. Personally, I also believe that these guys are doing great job, not only by delivering good food and wine to the patrons, but also in cultivating a wine culture in Cyprus. I had the chance to visit the place many times through the years and I always get surprised by the updated wine list and the delicious tapas. Ambience is elegant and comfort.",Vino Cultura
50,The very best of wine and tapas menu. Service is superb and the staff are friendly and very helpful.,Vino Cultura
50,"This is clearly a first-rate restaurant. The wine list, which is central to the restaurant's raisin d'etre, is long, comprehensive, and includes both all the best Cypriot wineries and a huge selection of foreign items. We found that the wine later was extremely knowledgeable and directed us towards the best and most interesting local wines. The food, which can be had either in small plate – tapas style or as major dishes, was not only well executed but quite original. We found the halloumi cheese dishes and several mushroom dishes to be excellent. In short, the food, wine, and the service, what all excellent.And what is the problem? It is simply that the restaurant allows – even encourages – – smokers. Cyprus must be one of the last countries in Europe that allows smoking in restaurants. I can only conclude that the management has determined that the local customers, who apparently appreciate smoking, are more important to their bottom line then the non-smokers. It is true that we were placed in the non-smoking section, but after about a half an hour the stench from the smokers began to permeate our area. It got worse as worse as the night proceeded. I can only suggest that you arrive early and try to leave before the smokers have completely taken over the restaurant. I really find it hard to understand why a restaurant that takes such exquisite care with its cuisine, and clearly understands that Wine does needs to,be carefully appreciated, allows this kind of environmental pollution. Please go to the local today and enjoy the wonderful food and the excellent wines – – but do so at your own risk if you arrive much later than 7 PM!",Vino Cultura
40,I like that place a lot. Very nice place. The staff very welcoming. A little bit expensive. We had salad and pizza.,Vino Cultura
50,Cosy ambiance in a winery atmosphere with excellent choice of wines from around the world. Fusion cuisine with tastes that easily surpass the best of restaurants ultimately coupled with outstanding service and prices. Highly recommended for all occasions. Well done.,Vino Cultura
50,"Great selection of vine and friendly staff.Food concept is ""tapas like"" when you can share any dish with friends. Portions are normal-sized so you may try several dishes, unlike many Cypriot taverns/bars. I tried most of the dishes and they are delicious.For sure the place to visit for a good conversation.",Vino Cultura
50,Food was great as always!!! Wine proposed by the sommelier was right on spot!! A place where they know what the customer wants and they deliver. Excellent team vino!,Vino Cultura
50,"By far the best wine bar in Nicosia, capable of competing international wine bars too. The staff are very helpful and know their wines well. Very relaxed atmosphere with great wines and platters to share with friends! I always go there when I'm in Nicosia and want to enjoy some quality wine. Must visit!",Vino Cultura
40,I heard about this place and finally I had the chance to be there with some local customers. Definitey a particular place to be. We had dinner outside but I had a chance to take a tour inside in the two exclusive cellars : one at the restaurant ground floor level and another once ( with exclusive selected wines ) upstairs. Food was nice and we enjoyed all dishes in a pleasant and relaxed atmopshere. Good and professional service by polite waitresses.,Vino Cultura
50,"The exterior of the place doesn't give credit to the marvellously designed interior, at the same time both unpretentious and exquisite.Surely one of the better selections of wines catering to most budgets and tastes, the jovial and personalised service, seeing to aquire customers' preferences first backed by communicating a saturated and knowing awareness of wines, followed by demonstrations of a few choices (and landing with the perfect bottle) made our night. All this without fuss or snobbery, with humour and light conversation. Decent cuisine ('tapas', in other words small portioned plates) of well prepared food compliments the whole experience.A word of advice: ordering the fixed menu is advisable for larger groups, as the price per quantity would drop substantially.",Vino Cultura
50,"If you are Nicosia and want to enjoy some great wines and a wonderful selection of tapas, this is the place. The wine bar/restaurant is associated with a wine store, so the selection of wines is almost endless. The catalog is more than 100 pages long, containing everything from a $3750 bottle of Chateau Petrus to $15 bottles of Greek and Cypriot wines. Fortunately, the staff well know their wine and are happy to share their knowledge. The atmosphere is very pleasant--and quiet until 9:00 PM most nights.",Vino Cultura

50,This is a consistently great place with an extensive wine list and a very well chosen (and seasonally changing) tapas menu.The owners are always on site and they have built up a loyal clientele based on excellent service and friendly staff.The décor is very tasteful and part of the establishment is a wine cellar where tastings are frequently organisedThey have live jazz some nights but the piped music is also very tasteful and loungy.This is a very good for anyone who enjoys great wine in a casual but smart environment.,Vino Cultura
50,"Great wine list, great atmosphere and fantastic staff! I would definitely go back again next time in Nicosia.",Vino Cultura
40,I liked the place and loved the wine. The staff knows the drinks and wines and is very helpful. I tried some of the dishes which were very tasty. The prices are way to high though. Not visiting again if the prices continue to be so exorbitant.,Vino Cultura
50,"What a gem to find on my last night in Nicosia for business. This mild-mannered wine bar/restaurant was the best and most enjoyable surprise of the trip. After looking through the menu, our party decided on ordering one of the three complete meal menu options. After that, the food seemed like it would never stop coming. Don't think of this as a dinner, rather as a dining experience served with all of the experiences in a more more upscale restaurant. The tapas-style dinner was a delight, the variety and pairing of the food was genius, and our server knew the menu and made some superb recommendations. The courses were part food and part art, and we had a spectacular experience. The only downside . . . it was our last evening in Nicosia and we would not have another opportunity to experience Vino Cultura again. Go, eat and fall in love with this bar-restaurant. It will be impossible to be disappointed.",Vino Cultura
10,"Was very disappointed with the service and quality of food served... Went as a romantic evening, ordered tapas and we had to remind the waiter two times to be served a piece of meat and bread after two hours ! We asked for dry wine and were served semi-sweet, and forced to leave when new customers came in. Will never go back again",Vino Cultura
50,"One of my favorites! Great wine, great tapas, bar like atmosphere what else could you ask for a great night out? Prices.....well prices can vary from reasonable to a bit on the high side especially if you order tapas on a piecemeal basis. Be wise however and order from the set menus and you won't feel you have paid much for the quality and quantity you will get. Definitely will visit again and again!",Vino Cultura
50,The best wine list I seen in my life. Good wines you cant find anywhere and good choices of tapas. Highly recommended!,Vino Cultura
50,"Vino cultura is a one of a kind in Nicosia; there is other wine bar/tapas place just like it. It has its own style and always has a lovely yet relaxing atmosphere. The waiters are very polite and helpful, service is excellent and always on time. The food is not only exquisite, but it is always prepared and presented in a nice way. Highly recommended, do not miss out!",Vino Cultura
50,"I've been visiting this place for years and it is amazing. The quality of the food and the variety of wine remains up to standards, as one would expect from a wine bar. Vino of course is more than just a wine bar, it has a philosophy on its own which one understands when they visit it. The menu is quite extensive with reasonably prices options including pizza, fish and meat tapas, cheese platters and salads. Best to select a few dishes and share. My review would not be complete without mentioning the impeccable service. The waiters are attentive, if not too much attentive at times! Vino has been and will continue to be a favourite place to hang out with friends!",Vino Cultura
50,"This is a great restaurant and bar all round. There is a great variety of food and wine and it is quality food. The service is always very efficient with polite, capable and pleasant staff. I have been going here for years and the quality hasn't gone down. Definitely worth booking here for dinner, drinks with friends or meetings.",Vino Cultura
50,"I've been to VC many times and the food, wine, and service are excellent. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. The food is creative and tasty with a variety of choices. And, of course, the wine list is extensive, both in varieties and geography.I have attended both business dinners and dinner parties at VC and the atmosphere is great for both.",Vino Cultura
50,Amazing food and excellent variety of wines that can satisfy all different types of wine lovers! Recommended without any doubts!!!,Vino Cultura
50,"What a wonderful spot in Nicosia!!!!! The wine list is selected with such a care!!! The food is great with a large variety of platers and plates to share!!!! Really the place to come, relax and spend a wonderful time with your friends and coworkers!!!!",Vino Cultura
50,Love it!!!! Absolutely recommend it!!! Excellent wine and food accompanied by wonderful relaxing music.,Vino Cultura
40,Very good variety and quality of wines. The food is delicatessen and focused in a wine experience. The place is very well decorated and very warm atmosphere .,Vino Cultura
50,"The food is amazing. Great ingredients. Very fresh and delicious. The menu is fantastic and the combination of ingredients is exquisite. The food is very well cooked. Not bland or dull or over/under cooked, which points to a very good chef. Excellent and wide range of wine. Service is top notch. The price is a little high but for top quality food, thats the price to pay. Overall, I enjoyed my experience very much!",Vino Cultura
50,"Few days ago i had attended one of the Wine Master classes Andreas the owner is organizing. After that we stayed for dinner and that was my first time we ate there. We tried many different dishes, all very tasty. Best i can say was the Tuna Tataki from Cyprus Tuna, and the pizza. We had couple of different but has a huge selection and cant think any better place to drink a nice bottle of wine. It was Thursday night and was live jazz music, place was full with very nice people and all looked to enjoy there. Would love to visit again and recommend it to anyone!",Vino Cultura
30,"Quite a nice, elegant place for a glass of wine and something on the side. I expected a bit more in terms of the food, since the taste and the freshness was not corresponding to the price. For wine and cold plates, it is a very good place. For an exceptional dinner it needs a few more touches",Vino Cultura
50,"This wine bar has a very good reputation in Nicosia and I can certainly vouch that it deserves it. Polite helpful staff, excellent food, an extensive cava with staff on hand to help with your selection. It has a certain standard that is always maintained and the music is just right. Having sampled various dishes, including their amazing platters, I was amazed to find out that the chef, Andreas, did not study abroad but here locally in Cyprus. He himself is a real treasure, very inventive and creative dishes. For me, eating inside the Cava area itself is a joy, wonderful atmosphere and to be surrounded by bottles of nectar is so delightful! Will be on my regular places to go to and would definately recommend to friends and family.",Vino Cultura
50,Nice place Good atmosphere Great selection of wines Good food Overall experience must say that it's great but do expect to pay a bit more than the usual wine bar.,Vino Cultura
50,Vino Cultura offers an extensive variety of good wines from various parts of the world. Its cheese and meat platter is delicious. It has a pleasant ambiance and good service. The staff are knowledgeable and willing to offer advice. All in all an excellent wine bar!,Vino Cultura
50,"We were here twice during our stay in Nicosia - for dinner and for the Jazz night. The cellar offers a great choice of wines (and cocktails), the flavors were unique and the staff was very very friendly! Totally recommended!",Vino Cultura
40,"An agreeable wine bar with an excellent choice of wines (except for the lack of Ribera del Dueo and Priorato). Service was excellent and attentive. The food was uninspired but we were there for the place and the wine. We will go back, though probably not to eat.",Vino Cultura
40,This was my second visit in the last few months. There is a great wine list and really great tapas type food. The fillet steak dish is particularly good.,Vino Cultura
50,"I've now been a few times to Vino Cultura and have loved it more and more.It has become my favourite place to head to when in Nicosia.There isn't anything about it I dislike. The decor, menu and service all all spot on.I usually manage to make a booking a few days in advance for 8-10 people. We get a great table and I'll always start with one of their fabulous cocktails. The drinks menu is seemingly endless and there isn't a cocktail they can't make!The food menu is designed for sharing and come in fairly large portions for 'tapas' style. My friends and colleagues aren't so good with sharing so we order two dishes each and are very satisfied. I should add that the service is superb and they do advise you that the dishes will arrive at various times as and when they are ready.I've yet to take anyone there and not have them rave about the atmosphere, quality and choice.The menu is very reasonably priced and I'd recommend anyone try their Makers Mark Old Fashioned!Considering I've only been a few times now it's always nice to be recognised by the friendly team there.I look forward to the next time.",Vino Cultura
50,"I went there with my husband to celebrate Valentine's day. They have set menus for 2 where you get to choose the tapas. The food was AMAZING, it may have been the best I have tried in Cyprus. It was a lot for two people though so better go hungry or order less :) One negative comment I have is that even though we booked well in advance-almost 20 days-we were given a choice of two not well located tables-I realize they wanted the central ones for larger groups but still, an early reservation should guarantee a better spot....",Vino Cultura
50,"One of my favourite places to go out in Nicosia! The atmosphere prepares you for a lovely evening, as it is really cosy. Most tables are high with stools which are surprisingly comfortable and there is a long bar where you can sit and have drinks and bites. The barman is an expert on wines and you can try different kind of wines by the glass. The wine list is really long and very, very good and you can find something for any budget. The food is very good too, mainly tapas or platters. I definitely reccomend the salad with goat cheese, the mushrooms, the ravioli, the mini burgers and the pizza. And the music is good too. Highly reccomended! This place can become a habbit.",Vino Cultura
40,"Nice design, good feel to the establishment, good music, relatively good selection of wines, some dishes for light dinner (among them angus beef), attentive service. Ideal place for a relaxed time.",Vino Cultura
50,"What a great find. First time visitor to this bar and I will definitely be coming back. The bar has a great atmosphere relaxed, and welcoming. Fabulous wine choice and food to satisfy all diets!. The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly.",Vino Cultura
50,"Great atmosphere, very welcoming friendly helpful staff. I went here for a friends birthday, I was asked what I would like as I wasn't sure the bar man offered me options, such as red,white rose, so I picked one, sweet or dry so I picked again then sparkling or not. He came back with a bottle that was exactly what I asked for, the wine was amazing I eneded up having 3/4 bottles and ordered some for over the Christmas period.I am so happy I found something to drink that I like!!!We also had a mixture of tapas, we was a arwarkard bunch, one of us did know like fish one didn't eat pork and another was a vegetarian, but waiter was very patient and offered to make up a tapas that's not on the menu and throw us together something for us all. And the presentation of the food was beautiful.I would most defiantly go there again and really would like to take friends there to experience this bar too.I I had such a great evening!",Vino Cultura
50,"A very good selection of wines and great food, super surroundings, will return next time we are in Nicosia.",Vino Cultura
40,"Vino cultura takes the wine bars around the world to a different level. Great atmosphere, live music is played at the background. When I received the wine list-I fall in love. They have a very nice variety of wines, from all over the world. really impressive. The service was great. We had a really great night out with another couple of friends, even though the food was very disappointing.",Vino Cultura
50,"Great food, great typical wines, great ambiance, great service! If you are a wine geek, this restaurant/wine bar is The place to be in Nicosia! Ask Andreas for advice and you will have An unforgettable and mindblowing experience!",Vino Cultura
40,"I visited the bar with a friend of mine for a Saturday night out. The staff was very friendly, polite and knowledgeable and service was god. We tried 3 different wines and all had excellent quality and were served at proper temperature. Their price was also appropriate. The only thing we found really disappointing was the amount of food (fig bruscetta with goat cheese and tabouli) which was so miniature that it was `surprising` ! :( As both of them were made from really cheep ingredients (exception the goat cheese) we could not find any convincing explanation for the size of the portions.",Vino Cultura
40,"We visited the bar with friends for a casual night out. Nice atmosphere, nice music very good service, very polite and knowledgable staff. They've introduced a ""summer wine list"" with around 100 labels of easy summery wines at reduced prices. What an excellent idea!!. Nice food as always but the cheese platter needs some effort. Overall a great place to visit.",Vino Cultura
40,"I'm glad this place hasn't crashed in the recession. There is an extensive wine list with wines from around the world and the food is decent enough. I wouldn't come here specifically for food, but with friends it is ideal as all the plates are designed to be shared. It's large enough not to feel crowded but at the same time small enough to maintain an intimacy necessary for wine bars. The staff are professional and friendly-we called (before opening hours) and they must have checked their missed calls and called us back-on a UK number. Thank-you.",Vino Cultura
40,Visited Vino Cultura early March of this year. I wasn't happy back then due to the smoking. This time it was much better. The wine selection was excellent and we were given good advice. Prices were particularly good and so was the service.,Vino Cultura
50,"One of my favourite places in Cyprus!!! Very good service,friendly people, great jazz on thursdays and very cheap but designed food! In order to rest and enjoy the atmosfere is better to come on thursdays or on other working day when it is not so crowded",Vino Cultura
40,"very good relaxing atmosphere, fantastic wine, very good food and a very good proposition for business dinners, also very good customer service",Vino Cultura
40,"I haven't been there since December, but when I was I enjoyed. I love style, wine selection and atmosphere(or is this glass of wine to much ;)). First time we were in rush, so we had just glass of red wine and cheese plate. Service was quick and kind. Second time we ordered a bottle I think meat plate and some ravioli(it is been a while so I am not sure). Everything was delicious.What boders me was a waitresses which was very arrogant(older lady), when we ask her what is her recommendation,she said to me in unpleasant tone:tell me what you want.. Well if I knew what I want I wouldn't ask her would I? But we forget her quickly, she was replaced with another girl (red hair,younger) and she repair our impression:) she was friendly,kind,helpful and professional.The other thing is: ""border"" with smoking area. I am ex smoker so it bothers me a lot,since we were sitting next to terrace.Anyway I would recommended to all wine lovers and those who want to forget about time a bit(it least I did ;))",Vino Cultura
50,"If you are looking for a place with magic atmosphere, best wine, tapas and relaxing music vino cultura is the place to be. Friendly staff, quick service and good prices with high quality. Everybody speak about something new in Cyprus with many awards. People if you visit Nicosia don,t miss it. Every time new surprises from the chef and the owners!!",Vino Cultura
40,"Great dishes for all tastes. Bit expensive. Great wines! When we went there was a lady singing live jazz accompanied by a piano. Wine, food and music blended perfectly!",Vino Cultura
40,"Went there for the first time Thursday night as it was jazz night. As a non smoker I was extremely disappointed - they have an inside/outside area, but they are not really separated. If the arrangement is legal, then might as well allow smoking everywhere.The acoustics are not very good so one couldn't really enjoy the music. The wine list is extensive and good.I shall wait until the summer time to go back - at least by then the smokers will really be outside and we won't have to share their unhealthy habit.",Vino Cultura
50,"Very good service!, Excellent wine selection, Great atmosphere...If there was a good music flavour added to this could be one of the best restaurants in Nicosia.",Vino Cultura
40,"We went for some wine and cheese. They seem to know quite a lot about wines as we first ordered a wine that we didn't like that much but when we asked for different that you'd be more sweet, the 2nd one was much better! A bit pricey but overall a nice place!",Vino Cultura
20,However... The smokers are too close to non-smokers. Pity! Otherwise great food wine. Helpful staff who know their wines.,Vino Cultura
50,"not located in the main tourist areas in Nicosia but most definitely worth a visit. Relaxed dining, excellent selection of wines and champagne..they do need to hire a barman who knows his way around cocktails. ..",Vino Cultura
40,"We visited the bar with friends for a ""wine and tapas night"". Nice atmospere, nice music for that kind of bars, comfortable sitting, very good service, excellent and polite staff. They were extremelly helpfull as they offered to try 2-3 different wines before ordering. Of course they do have a big variety of wines, for all tastes. The tapas and everything we ordered were really good with nice presentation. I would suggest that you try the rocket salad with cheese, ravioli with chicken and mushroom, tapas with chicken, halloumi crochets with a nice unusual sauce and tapas with cyprus sausage. We also liked the bread, and as we were told it was their chef's recipe. We will definitely go back. YES, I DO RECOMMEND THE PLACE..!!!!",Vino Cultura
50,"We went for ""wine and cheese"" night with some friends. The service was excellent, very polite, when you ordered the wine you could tell that they knew what they were doing, and their service was excellent which is very important if you want your customers to return! They have a loong list of wines to choose from which might make your life more difficult if you don't know them! So we tried two different rose wines! The prices for the bottles were reasonable, and the cheese platter was very tasty. Only if they had more quantity would be perfect! Strongly recommended for wine lovers!!!",Vino Cultura
50,"Good place with a good prices. You can go there for the romantic evening for two, with bunch of friends or even arrange to have a celebration party there.",Vino Cultura
40,"This place is great for wine lovers. They have a HUGE selection of wines being a wineshop and they have paired this up with a decent menu that has a lot of variety.I have visited many times and have only had to send one of the many tapas style dishes back, and apart from that one, all have been from good to excellent.One this it seriously and urgently needs to do is change the menu - it has been the same for way too long.This kind of place should change the menu at least 2 times a year - it is tapas style and that needs to be fresh, new and exciting.Overall, it is a great place to go.",Vino Cultura
50,"Love love love! One word. Three times. Pretty much sums up my experience. Tapas were awesome! The beef steak, seriously, INCREDIBLE!! The sauce on the ravioli could have been served to me in a glass, I would have drunk it up it was that good! The wine was this bubbly sweet deliciousness that you didn't want to stop drinking! And the service, well, that service was second to none. So attentive! So yeah, all in all, definitely a winner!! Get there people, yum yum!!",Vino Cultura
50,"Great wine, great atmosphere, great food. The best wine restaurant in Cyprus. If you are a wine lover this is the place to visit!!!!",Vino Cultura
50,"Since its commencement of business about 3 years ago, Vino Cultura has managed to become the best Wine and Tapas Bar in Cyprus.Vino Cultura is characterised by its vast selection of local and international wines. While it keeps the majority of the wine-list intact, Vino Cultura often introduces its clientele to new wines, thereby ensuring that it is always kept-up with the developments in this niche area of the wine business.The menu is filled with a selection of tapas, ranging from the breath-taking halloumi croquettes to delicious squid and perfectly cooked fillet stakes. The menu further boasts a variety of cold-cuts including cheese and fruit platters.Service is top of the range, with the waiters and waitresses not only being constantly around to offer customers a pleasant stay, but also having a great knowledge of each item on the menu and a thorough understanding of the wine list. It is no surprise that they have the knowledge and ability to recommend, upon request, a specific wine in accordance with someone's order and particular tastes.Lastly, being a regular customer and having had the pleasant chance to meet Vino Cultura's owners, Andreas and Kostas, it must be said that these guys are not just businessmen; they really love what they are doing. They possess excellent knowledge in their field, Andreas currently being the only Cypriot award-winning sommelier, and they strive to interact with their customers (visiting each table to offer a warm welcome and ensure they are having a good time) and combine business with a touch of social interaction.Last but not lease, there is a value for money in Vino Cultura. This place has come to stay!",Vino Cultura
40,"Visited Vino Cultura on a Thursday night and the place was almost full. Found the wine list a bit limited considering that this is a Wine Bar although there were many interesting wines listed. I found the prices for both wine and tapas to be actually reasonable and the service was good and pleasant even though the wine ordered came wrong but this was rectified by the waiter as soon as I mentioned it. The good thing about this place is that it is not too serious about wine which is evident through the wine list, food, ambiance, lighting, music, furniture and clientele. It has a more casual Bar style feeling which makes it perfect for an alternative to a restaurant for a night out. I would definitely visit again.",Vino Cultura
50,Maybe the most authentic place for wine situated in Nicosia. Their huge variety of wines and their unique food plates will amazed everyone who thrives for quality. I strongly recommend this place!,Vino Cultura
40,"I have been to Vino Cultura on several occasions, mostly with friends, the last time being a month ago. I am not a ""bar person,"" meaning that I do not like the idea of sitting on stools all night, but i make an exception for this place since I absolutely love the food. The portions are small and rather pricey but if you go with the mindset of tapas, of trying different types of food in small portions, you are set. See it as, you nibble on fantastic food! My favorite is by far the halloumi with the pommegranet juice. Exquisite! The other food is good also, from the chicken to the steak. There is nothing really that was short of amazing. My biggest complaint with the place is that they really do not adhere to smoking regulations in a strict way. They are not illegal per se, but the smoking section from the non-smoking is really just a foot away since the now covered and enclosed veranda (which counts as outside and thus ok to smoke) is only a few cm away from the indoor tables where smoking is prohibited. So it was a big disappointment that we came home with stinky clothes and hair and I had to shower all over again.",Vino Cultura
50,"Overall excellent experience...Very good food, extended wine list, friendly stuff ready to advise you about wine choices...Value for money! My husband and I visit at least once every month!!!! Totally recomend it as one of the best places to visit in Nicosia!",Vino Cultura
50,"Excellent service and the food is so unique. I love the choices in food and of course in wine. Also, i love it when i describe the type of wine that i want they know immediately what to bring me.",Vino Cultura
50,Really pleasant place. Enjoyed the night! Great service. Variety of tapas. Good price. Really respectable place to host your guests. Value for money.,Vino Cultura
20,"Over-priced and over-rated, for the award-winning wine bar. The prices are way too high, both for the wine and the tapas. The decor is good, stools are a bit uncomfortable.",Vino Cultura
40,"Nice place for drink wines.If you are starving you must to eat before you go. The food is nice but the quantity was not enough for a hungry person. Price are acceptable not cheap and to expensive, it was fine.",Vino Cultura
10,"I can write many many good things about this place. Food is great, service is great, wines are awesome. A bit pricey but worth the experience.But they need to do something with the way they treat the smoking regulations. The whole place stinks from smoking. Smoking is allowed everywhere apart from the bar and the 2 tables next to the entrance. Still the bar and the two tables are in direct communication with the rest of the place where smoking is allowed. Went there with my pregnant wife but could stay long due to the stink. It's a shame for such a quality place to lower its standards so much with the way they are treating this matter.Not recommended if you can't stand smoking. Our hair stinks, our clothes the same and we had to leave earlier.",Vino Cultura
40,"Elegant deco, very wide wine list, I tried a sparkly one with apricot very nice! I liked the music, very ambiance place, excellent tapas selection BUT unfortunately very small portions (ok I understand gourmet but most of what we ordered reminded me of samples of food not food) and very expensive!",Vino Cultura
40,"I like this place, it's relaxing, you can enjoy your wine n nice music - sometimes it has live music- excellent sevice, tasty tapas, but eapecially the food is too expensive n the portions are quite small. all in all tho i definetly recommend it!",Vino Cultura
50,"A great place for couples to go for a night out. The place has very tasty and delicious tapas, and even better wines! The decoration of the wine bar is amazing and elegant. Service was very good even for a Saturday with the place all filled up. Prices were very reasonable, it cost like 3-4euros for a glass of wine. Will DEFINETELY go again in Vino Cultura when i am in Nicosia, finally a great place to go out and drink some good wine!I would recommend though to make a reservation before going (especially if one wants to go during the weekend) as it tends to become filled with people and you might end up not finding a table.",Vino Cultura
40,"You get invited to go and have a drink at this wine bar. Nothing really to it, until you arrive. A very welcoming environment, open space and with the summer months, the front facade is open. Definitely a place to enjoy some wine and tapas, after a hard day at work, or when you just want to go out. Service is excellent, the owners making sure everyone feels at ease and is happy. I think it is their passion for wine and people, that makes Vino Cultura different from other places. There is an excellent wine list and some good tapas to accompany it. Try the Rucola Salad.There's also theme evenings, like (blind) Wine tasting on Mondays and Tuesdays from 6 to 8pm, live blues and jazz on Wednesdays and Thursdays.Looking for something different? Be sure to visit Vino Cultura.",Vino Cultura
50,"After a long time, we decided to share a bottle of wine on an outing instead of home. We chose Vino Cultura for our visit. We ordered a bottle of wine and 2-3 tapas to share. Unfortunately one of the tapas was not served hot and therefore we complaint to the waiter. Immediately the waiter escalated this to the manager that insisted of serving something else. He did not give any excuses or justifications but he gave attention to customer care. In addition, they served us two more glasses of wine, and therefore made our evening even better.I don't remember ever a cypriot bar/restaurant manager that took so much attention to rectifying a situation than to make excuses for it.Very professional, excellent approach! We will definitely revisit.",Vino Cultura
40,This bar is a good choice if you are looking for something different in the city. We paid 25 euros per person for unlimited wine and a selection of tapas. Tapas were very well presented and most of them very tasty. Its a good option for a night out but can be a bit expensive.,Vino Cultura
30,"The place is nice. Nothing special but with good atmosphere. The food is average. You wait to find more delicated dishes in a wine bar instead of American style dishes. It is expensive, especially for this period...",Vino Cultura
50,"Nice food, although a bit expensive, delicious wines, relaxing atmospere, live music, very good service!",Vino Cultura
50,This place always has a relaxed atmosphere and you can try nice wine and cheese platters here at reasonable prices. A small problem is the parking but this is common in Cyprus restaurants!,Vino Cultura
40,"Very nice and relaxed atmosphere, perfect place for finishing a busy day. Good service and very wide wine lists. You can accompany your wine with a selection of tapas, salads and some cheese/meat platters.Prices are good. Ask for the wine list of the month (a selection of white, red, rose and sparkling wines).",Vino Cultura
40,Had drinks & nibbles here! Food excellent - salad was a large portion for two served with bread on the side. Halloumi croquette balls exquisite! Large variety of wines available by the glass. Atmosphere warm and inviting! Lovely music! :),Vino Cultura
40,They have an excellent wine cellar since they are one of the wine importers of the island. You can taste any wine by glass or open a whole bottle. Every few months they change the wine catalogue and the finger food menu. The food menu is small but it has some dishes that you will find no where else. Some days of the week they have live music. It is a place you visit once a while since it is expensive.,Vino Cultura
50,"excellent range of wines, great food and ambiance that will make people feel comfortable. you can visit either for business dinners or to enjoy with friends.",Vino Cultura
50,Very cool place to enjoy a glass of wine with a cheese platter or a selection of tapas. The food and cheese platter were very tasty and the wine list very extensive and very reasonably priced. A very nice wine bar in Nicosia.,Vino Cultura
40,"visited it last saturday with a couple, friends of us who reccomended it as they go often and they live in nicosia! Service great , tapas great & wine any of your choice!! had 2 bottles of different ones white and red! we all enjoy the place, the food and the cosy atmosphere with our friends!!!! it's a place and escape to get away from routine and the busy week to relax and have fun with your selections on variety of wines! we ll visit it often again....",Vino Cultura
30,"We visited Vino Cultura with another couple and we all liked the venue, a mix of modern and cosy wine bar. Nice atmosphere and music. Service was friendly and the wine selection as to be expected is good. We had 2 bottles of Cianti Reserva and ordered a chees platter and a number of side dishes. The wine was good, but not exeptional. The cheese platter a disapointment, for 20 Euros you would expect more for than a few cubes of cheese and a roasted strips of bread.Other dishes were also tiny portions! Overall the food is overpriced and disappointing.",Vino Cultura
40,A nice place with great atmosphere to sit for a glass of wine. A large list of wines available and very tasty platters to choose from. But be prepared to pay a premium for the food and wine. Overall a place worth visiting.,Vino Cultura
40,"Very good. we enjoyed win and tha atmosphere, but very expensive. tapas are overpriced and low quantity",Vino Cultura
40,"Very good surprise when i discovered this place with a local friend. Great choice of wines and very good plates with a choice of cypriots dry meats, cheeses and pickles.Very nice beers too, definitely a good place to go for a drink. Friendly and very professional staff.",Vino Cultura
40,"Having been to this wine bar a couple of times and being a bit of a wine lover, I can honestly say this place ticks most boxes. Good selection of wines by the glass, tapas-style food, good cheese platters, cozy ambiance and some knowledgeable waiters.What I'd like to see is better, faster service and more platters. A dessert platter would be great, along with some dessert wine or a pâté/foie gras platter paired with Sauternes wine. Simple things like that would elevate this wine bar to the next level and make it the natural stop for every wine lover out there.",Vino Cultura
50,"Vino Cultura is a great wine bar whether for large groups, casual drinks with a few friends, or a romantic evening (been there for all these reasons and people have always been enthusiastic about the place). Their selection of wines highlights both local and international gems, and the knowledge and helpfulness of the owner Andreas helps even the most undecided amateur find a glass to their taste. Great selection of wines by the glass and by the bottle, which is nice because you do not have to compromise on quality just because you are not going to order a bottle.And at Vino, everything is done to complement the wine: laid-back atmosphere, great selection of music",Vino Cultura
50,"Very busy place so book way ahead in advance Good selection of wines ,the stuff are quite professional, fast in serving and well informed of menu",Vino Cultura
20,"The concept behind it is very good, however everything else is quite flawed. There isn't anywhere to park, there is too much noise coming from the street (I had to shout across the table for my friend to hear me), quite overpriced considering the tapas-sized dishes and mediocre quality, but the worst of all is the service. Lousy. I've been there three times and I was frustrated by them all three; they didn't want to serve us, they didn't pay us any attention, charged the wrong wine and had an attitude. Even if you just went there for a glass of wine (which they have a great selection), the frustration is just not worth it, and you're much better off in some other wine bar. Never again.",Vino Cultura
40,"Even thought the portions are small (food), the wine is excellent and well priced. In general the atmosphere is very good and its a place that people from 30's to late 40's can enjoy",Vino Cultura
50,"great great great......... this is a must go place. excellent service,bar and food. try the veal.really yummy.",Vino Cultura
50,"After visiting vino cultura wine and tapas bar in nicosia many times i strongly recommend it to anybody. Whether its for a romantic night out, a get together with friends, a business dinner or basically any event, you can rely on vino cultura. The excellent atmosphere, the friendly and experienced staff, the value for money wine and tapas will definately have you wanting to return again and again!!",Vino Cultura
50,"Great food,atmosphere and service.no other place is like Vino in Nicosia.really unique dishes.i would recommend it to everybody.",Vino Cultura
10,"Terrible restaurant, they had almost all table empty at 9:30 at night and they put us sit in the bar saying that all were reserved. The personnel was not helpful and did not wanted to serve us. Also no parking place.I do not recommend this to anyone,",Vino Cultura
50,The tapas in this place are exceptional made from the very best ingredients. The wine list is extensive since they import their wine from all over the world. A must !!,Vino Cultura
50,"This place is appropriate for a romantic evening or a funny night out with your friends! It has a wide range of wines,nice decoration and nice music!",Vino Cultura
50,"Vino cultura is one of those places, that you love from the moment you walk in. Great selection of inovative tapas accompanied with the right wines, served at the right temperature, from expertise stuff to help you make the right choice. Relaxing atmosphere with candle lights and great music playing as backround. Value for money place, is a must.Don't forget to visit the cava, located under the same roof to buy something for home.Ideal for a romantic evening or friends night out. Don't miss it!",Vino Cultura
40,"I went with a friend after work, knowing we proably woudn't get a table as there are only about 10 tables. We sat at the bar - ordered wine and a cheese platter, which was very well presented.The barmaid knew her wines as my friend is a bit of a wine buff and he spent about half an hour talking about vineyards and regions...Atmosphere is great - staff are very attentive. we did not have a sit down meal so cannot comment on the food quality. This is a pretty unique place for Nicosia - i don't believe anyone else offers a wine experience like Vino Cultura does.Total damage was €58 for a bottle of rose, a cheese platter and two glasses of champagne",Vino Cultura
50,When it comes to wine bars the most important thing is the wine list. In this place you can find an exceptional selection of red and white wines both when you order but the bottle but also when you order by the glass. The atmosphere is relaxed with good selection of music and a large selection of dishes to accompany your wine. If you are a wine lover you must visit this place. A useful tip if you are a tourist in Nicosia is to make a reservation if you are planning to visit on Friday and Saturday. Cypriots enjoy a night out and most places tend to be in demand.,Vino Cultura

20,"We were recommended Vino Cultura by a friend. We went at around 8pm on Saturday night. When we walked in we asked the guy at the front of the door if we could eat he asked sternly ""Do you have a reservation?"" to which we replied ""No"" he response ""The Bar"" and pointed. Charming. The restaurant was around 20% full and did not get any busier whilst we were there.The bar staff whilst being very friend were very slow and it took a long time just to get a drink. We looked at the menu but after the way we'd been treated we decided to leave and go somewhere else.The venue it's self is very nice and I am sure you could have a nice evening there if you're allowed to actually sit at a table.",Vino Cultura
40,"i was pleasantly surprised when i went to Vino Cultura. Good wine, very good prices, good music, good bar and great bartenders. Been there many times, even had a friend's birthday gathering there and it was really good. I really recommend it for a good, chilled, romantic night out. Book a table, or pop in earlier to find a place at the bar. The bartender is really good and will surprise you if you don't know what to have. Large list of wines by the glass or bottles in good prices.You should go if you like wine bars.",Vino Cultura

40,"This wine bar is something unique in Nicosia's nightlife.It is the first place in Nicosia that respects and treats wine, as it deserves to.First of all it serves a big variety of wines by glass. There is a big selection of sparkling, whites, roses and red wines served by glasses of 10 or 17.5 ml.But what it is really brilliant in this place is the fact that you can open any bottle of wine, from the wine store that is located in same place and have it served, with an extra fee of just 10-12 Euros.To make it clear, you can have, for example, a bottle of good Bordeaux that costs e.g. 60 Euros in the wine store and pay for it in the bar 70-72 Euros.This is amazing, if you account that almost all restaurants and bars in Cyprus, charge wine more than three times the price you buy it in a wine store.Concerning the food, they offer tapas and platters of cheeses and delicatessens which are very- very delicious (especially now with the new Chef).They only problem that I can find in this bar, is the place itself. It is actually a long and narrow building which is not so comfortable for the customers.But overall, Vino Cultura is a place that respects wine and owners respect their customers and try to do the best for them.It is a place that every wine lover MUST visit!",Vino Cultura
