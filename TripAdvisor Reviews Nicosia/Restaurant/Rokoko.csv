50,Amazing pasta dishes. Best carbonara in Cyprus. To share choices are exceptional.You should definitely try the nutella and mascarpone calzone for dessert!!,Rokoko
10,"Overrated, over-hyped. Very disappointing. I'm surprised of the high score. It does not reflect the reality. Definitely not recommended.",Rokoko
40,"Nice modern restaurant serving mainly several kind of pizzas, salads and pastas. The truffle pizza was tasty but the veggie pizza was just ok. The only desert, the Nutella with mascarpone cheese pizza was delicious. The service was good and waiters are very helpful and polite. The pizza is around 13 euros. We paid around 75 euros for 5 persons including soft drinks. Nice place to visit.",Rokoko
40,"This is a place you can find tasty italian food at good prices. I think this is the reason they are always fully booked. The menu drifts away from the traditional italian options, with a modern twist. Their spinach rolls are a must try! Also everybody is in love with their nutella mascarpone calzone! The seating is not very comfortable but I think that’s not the point of the restaurant. Also the waiters could be more aware of the customers as it felt like chasing them to order the food and the bill.",Rokoko
50,"This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Nicosia. We went as a company of five and we had pizzas and pastas. Pizzas were great of Italian style. I had the cacio e pepe pasta that was magnificent. In the end we had the Nutella calzone which was also really good. Prices are good, thus this is value for money. I’ll be back soon.",Rokoko
20,"New menu definitely leaves a lot to be desired....Really disappointed with the changes...Pepe e Cacio (which was amazing... and hard to find in other restaurants) was removed... Carbonara recipe changed to include mushrooms and cream!!!!! (apparently because that's how clients were asking for it)...This used to be the best Italian in Nicosia...Now, I am not so sure..On a positive note, service is still great",Rokoko
50,We visit this restaurant at least once a month. Every time our experience is amazing. Best pizza and pasta I've ever had in Cyprus.P. S. Dont forget to taste the nutella calzoneMudt visit!!!,Rokoko
50,"It is a very nice and cozy restaurant to visit. I myself was hearing from others that it a good place to visit, so I made the decision to go and see how it it. Well, thank god that I went because it's a great restaurant with great staff, great people and the food is too good as the prices are .It's a place you definitely need to visit especially if you are in Nicosia or at Old Nicosia.",Rokoko
50,"Great pastas and very quick and friendly service. And very, very well priced. The pizza was a bit too heavy but still good. I would easily have paid double or even triple the price. There is just one dessert - a suggestion to the owners would be to have some more desserts on the menu. Keep up the good work.",Rokoko
50,"Went there with as a group of 7 friends, for a birthday lunch. We had two vegetarians amongst us. Each one of us was happy with our meal, the orders being pasta with salmon, pasta with beef, pasta with chicken, artichoke salad (as a meal) and spaghetti and meatballs. The staff were very friendly and courteous and the food came in about 20 minutes. We will definitely be visiting, as this was our first visit to this lovely restaurant and try some of their other dishes!",Rokoko
50,"Great place, friendly staff, hip and trendy with great food. Their pizza, salads and chocolate calzone is a must! Booking is recommended.",Rokoko
50,"I can't even remember how many times we went to this place. It is our personal favourite in the city, even maybe in the island. The food here is out of this planet. The pizza is just delicious as is the pasta. Even though the food is superb the highlight of your experience will be the absolute king of desserts.... the nutella calzone!! The staff is very kind and helpful. Please make yourself a favor and visit this restaurant.",Rokoko
40,"very good food at reasonable prices. not a huge catalogue, few but delicious choices that you cannot resist at them. the staff is polite, very good service. one of my favorite spots of the city and try to go as often as possible",Rokoko
50,Lovely italian food. Great atmosphere. Great staff. A MUST reserve before going place. Amazin pizzas and garlic bread with cheese. One of the best italian cuisine restaurants in Cyprus5/5,Rokoko
50,"From the best italian restaurants I had the chance to visit in Cyprus. My rigatoni with chicken and mushrooms was amazingly cooked, without excess cream! It was just perfect. And also, do not leave this place without trying the nutella and mascarpone calcone! O M G it was just heaven on a plate! Prices were excellent and very reasonable. Cannot wait to visit again!",Rokoko
40,"Friends have been talking about this place for a long time and for good reason; I fell in love with it instantly. Admittedly it can get very noisy and crammed inside, even on a working day, therefore it is preferable to sit outside. There are quite a few vegetarian options, which is always a plus. I had the Primavera Tagliatelle, after a friend suggested it and I loved it. By far one the best things I've eaten at a restaurant in a long time. We also had the nutella calzone which was a dream! The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very cosy. Looking foward to going back soon!",Rokoko
40,"We have been to Rokoko numerous times, and we have never been disappointed with our meal and the service.One observation that we have been curious about is that for the past couple of years at least, there have never been any women on staff, when I asked, I was told it is coincidence, probably because women dont like this kind of work (hmmm?)",Rokoko
20,"I'd been looking for a good pizza restaurant and when I came across this, which seemed very crowded with one of the staff telling us that a booking was a must, I thought I'd better make a reservation to enjoy some pizza. Must be good since a booking is a must. When the day came, we were sorely disappointed. The pizzas had a very doughy base and the worst thing about it was that the pizzas smelt of meat! They'd likely been made on the same surface used to cook meat? No idea, but not a pleasant experience.",Rokoko
50,"Had dinner with friends and basically ordered a variety of dishes to share - menu tasting!Signature dishes or not , i think it was a sensational menu : Salads delicately aromatic, subtle taste for all pasta dishes we ‘ve tried.Pizza was top and so was the calzone desert ! Young, trendy, lofty-style interior. Looking around at other diners, everybody happy and smiling ; service fast , attentive and definitely impressed by the warm welcome for a first time visit.",Rokoko
50,"An amazing place for dinner and lunch! It is literally the best italian restaurant in Cyprus, always with the best service, high quality food and a delicious nutella calzone (you have to try it). excellent experience!",Rokoko
40,"This is the second time I visited this place. The pizzas are crispy thin and the salads impressive. one of my friends is a vegetarian, and here she will always enjoy the food. Spare some room for their superb and divine calzone with chocolate. it is heavenly. Best to be shared. Service excellent, Paid parking just opposite the shop. A reservation is a must.",Rokoko
50,"Rokoko has a lovely atmosphere! It may seem a small restaurant, but it’s not. It has tasty food. I am in love with their ‘orzo like risotto’. Moreover, they have a chocolate calzone with mascarpone cheese that its a must to try! Another excellent plate is their goat cheese salad! I am visiting rokoko at least once a month. Totally recommend :)",Rokoko
50,Best italian restaurant in cyprus. Cozy and warm atmosphere. Very helpful waiters. Heartwarming food ❤️,Rokoko
50,"A very modern small restaurant in central Nicosia. Good service, very tasty food, both the starters and the mains.The dessert is a must to try, calzone with chocolate.All with great prices.",Rokoko
50,I believe is the best Italian restaurant in Nicosia. Excellent food and the staff are young and very friendly and polite.,Rokoko
50,"The staff is very friendly,the food is tasty and quite good prices,i have visited many Italian restaurants but this one is out of words ,had a great night with great food and service",Rokoko
50,This is a lovely place for family/friends lunch or dinner! The atmosphere is nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful too!!It is definetely worthwile!!!!!!,Rokoko
50,The food is amazing especially the pizzas! Very polite staff and very good service. Value for money restuarant!Highly recomended!,Rokoko
40,I was trying for the last two months to reserve a table. However it was always full. I therefore decided to go there for my birthday and made the booking two weeks in advance. Everything I ordered for my group of friends was tasty and nicely presented. I would strongly suggest the restaurant to hire more waiters as we had to wait quite a long time for service. Luckily I preordered everything so food was on time despite of the drinks. Dessert menu needs to have more variety.,Rokoko
50,"It is a must for everyone gay and straights will love itThe owners working hard and all homemade delicious things, cakes, meals, lovely teas and best coffee in townTry the machaschino with Nutella uniqueThanks guys",Rokoko
40,Located in Nicosia. Always busy you need definitely to reserve during the week end. The pizza with cheese was good but the pasta with lobster and shrimps was ok. The buffalo salad was really tasty and I liked the wine too. It’s nice place to be. The atmosphere is friendly,Rokoko
50,"I took my family there for Saturday Lunch; my two daughter, two sons in law and three grandchildren. We had pizzas, raviolis, salads and desert. The home made raviolis were very fresh and the desert pizza calzone (filled with nutella ) was excellent. The rose wine we had was served at the right temperature in the correct glasses. The service was fast and the children's food arrived very quickly.",Rokoko
50,"One of the best resturant in nicosia.i loved the food,service and the place. Verry friendly and lovley people.",Rokoko
30,"Atmosphere is realy nice, staff are friendly and the food is clean and nice but nothing really special or exciting. The “nutella dessert” looks much better than it tastes in my opinion",Rokoko
50,We shared different plates with friends and all were amazing. The starters were very tasty and the drinks were great. You should try the calzone!,Rokoko
50,"It is always a pleasure to visit Rokoko. The guys there do an amazing job, always friendly and with a smile. The food is consistently good, not the biggest menu out there, but all items taste nice and are always fresh. Desserts are great, try out the chocolate calzone with a couple of friends.",Rokoko
40,Funky little restaurant bar with good music and a fairly good menu choice. Very friendly staff.Food is tasty and not too overpriced. Good drinks menu too.,Rokoko
40,"The dishes are carefully prepared and tasty, but nothing special or unforgettable. I would prefer the pizza dough to be more fluffy and the lasagna more on the italian side (i.e. bechamel to be replaced by ricotta and other cheeses). The lasagna reminded me of the greek dish ""pastitsio"", just the type of pasta was different. The highlight of the evening was the calzone with nutella and mascarpone, I give this dessert 10/10. This was indeed unforgettable. We'll return for this.",Rokoko
30,"Waiting 40 minutes to be seated on a table cannot be considered as good service.We did enjoy the pasta, but the place is too busy. Maybe better to visit this place off peak and you will like it.",Rokoko
50,"busy res requiredgood food spagetti and pizza, open oven, staff friendly and quick, nice design,central location, good music",Rokoko
50,"This place is excellent in service, prices and quality of food. The pasta is fresh and delicious and the oven pizza made in front of your eyes can;t get any better. Don't forget to try the made in house Nutella calzone desert. For me and my friends is a place we must go at least once month. They also have a huge selection of cocktails in case you are a cocktail lover. My personal favorite is Hugo, I had one of the best here. Keep up the good work!!",Rokoko
50,great food and service every time..very reasonable prices and friendly staff!one of the best places to eat in nicosia,Rokoko
50,"Love going there. Except from their pizzas, you should definitely try their calzone with Nutella. Personnel is very friendly and they also have a big variety of cocktails.",Rokoko
50,Great place with awesome food and even better desserts. Brick oven pizza is the best and don't get me started on the appetizers! What's more the staff are really nice and helpful. Must visit.,Rokoko
40,"Service is good, food is excellent, vibe is nice. You should visit. It is a good choice if you are going on a date. It is not so a family place.",Rokoko
50,"Great food, great prices, best service!!People there are very friendly and polite, they know what they serve very well and they can give you suggestions. Food is excellent, and desserts more than the best!",Rokoko
50,"Rokoko is really one of the best places to enjoy a amazing pasta, Italian pizza, great salads and amazing Nutella/mascarpone calzone! I have been visiting Rokoko since it was open and i never got disappointed. Great atmosphere, polite waiters and owners and amazing food! What else to ask fo!",Rokoko
50,"People that know how to work.That says it all!Great food, reasonable prices, helpful staff, nice music, nice place, what more can I ask?Make sure you reserve a table beforehand.We went on a Thursday night and it was fully booked.",Rokoko
50,Been there twice. The environment is beautiful and the food is very good. I would totally recommend the mushroom risotto.,Rokoko
50,"Excellent. The only word describing our experience at Rokoko. The staff was helpful, the italian pizza was spot on, and the pasta cooked to perfection. No photos since we devoured our food before even thinking about sharing them here! We'll definitely come back!",Rokoko
40,"I took my girlfriend out for dinner, we shared a starter and a salad and then we had a dish of pasta each. We found the food very tasty, (although it wasn't traditional italian but more likely a contemporary twist on italian food), portions were very fulfilling, I was fairly stuffed by the end of my main dish (as a native cypriot I eat my fair share at the table), too sad I didn't had space enough for the Nutella calzzone.The pricing is reasonable, although there are a couple dishes that cost a tad more the greater majority is very reasonable. The cocktails seemed fine although i didn't much enjoy mine I believe it was an unfortunate choice comparing to my taste preferences, my girlfriend's cocktail tasted nice though.The place is not vast, seats are limited so call early to reserve a seat, personally i called 2 days prior to my date and still the only seat available was on the bar (which was alright) but what threw me off the most was, we were placed by the door so whenever somebody would go through we would get hit by a freezing breeze. The atmosphere is cool (get it?), but no it's quite relaxing, I wouldn't say impressive in any way it was quite simplistic but in a nice way. There are couple of interesting details to notice when looking around while waiting for the food but I won't spoil you the fun.One last point for smokers, you can't smoke inside, but going out for a smoke is not a struggle and a perfect opportunity to take a smoke brake between starter and main dishes (by annoying the lovely couple sitting closer to the door)",Rokoko
50,"Great environment! Good, friendly service. Value for money! The pasta dishes are great but so are the pizzas. Go for the goat cheese salad - delicious!!!Do yourselves a favour and order the nutella-mascarpone calzone..its HEAVENLY!!!",Rokoko
30,"Have you ever been in a situation where you could not decide with your 'other half' which is the best choice to dine tonight, having in mind that she has to agree first? Well this was one of the situations where we ended up dining in this fancy place called Rokoko. Actually it was planned before but you never know. First i would like to stress out the beautiful and warm design that has Italian attributes. Secondly the smell. That smell of the slight burning of pizza dough giving a unique crust and flavour. Oh lord. And finally the smart menu design. Thumbs up on that. Getting on with the food, my pasta dish was quite tasty, although i would prefer a bit more quantity and a slightly warmer dish. Really fancied the starter garlic flatbread. Classic and tasty as it should be. Period. Finally i have to admit that we did not ordered the much talked about 'nutella calzone'. Firstly because i find it a bit absurd and secondly because its just nutella in a dough afterall. The couple beside us ordered one of this and was quite interesting to watch them filming the whole process of cutting it open. In any case that is subjective and not for everyone to hang on to.Overall this was an interesting dining experience, really tasty with warm atmosphere and very helpful service.",Rokoko
40,"Very nice food but little bit cold my main plate, However very good service,nice atmosphere and excellent other plates like salmon, mushroom risotto, spinach rolls & pizza..relatively good prices too as the food is fresh-nothing frozen..must visit",Rokoko
40,"It was a rocky start to our evening, although I made a reservation for 8 people a week ahead, arrived at the restaurant to find out we had two small tables put together forcing the people in the middle to sit with their legs spread on either side of the table legs! The tables were uneven and the place was crammed. However .... when the food arrived our original annoyance subsided. The spinach roll starters, pizza and pasta main dishes were fantastic. All dishes arrived at the same time and the food was well presented. The wine list needs a bit of work but will definitely go back. To their credit, the staff handled our original annoyance courteously and despite the fact the place was packed, service was very good. Rokoko is probably one of the best Italian restaurants on the island. If you want a table don't forget to book.",Rokoko
50,"Visited the place for a quick dinner and was impressed by the service and food quality. A really nice Pizza & Pasta place with great coctails, located just outside Nicosia Old City. A sweet and tasty surprise was their desert, Calzone with mascarpone and nutella!!!",Rokoko
40,"Very good service, convenient food, romantic lighting. Large portions. A lot of noise, not recommended for quiet people.",Rokoko
50,"Excellent food of high quality, very good cocktails, excellent prices and excellent atmosphere. We really love this place.",Rokoko
50,"Amazing place, nice environment , excellent food , i ate the lobster spaghetti and its was wonderful , value for money !! Good serviceMust visit",Rokoko
40,"Menu includes pizzas, pastas, salads and some American style main dishes. Pizzas were extremely thin crust and were the real stars of the menu. Diavola was really delicious! Pastas were just ok, nothing special though... Although we haven't had any cocktails, seeing them on the table next to us were looking really tempting. Prices are good and ambience is simple and stylish.",Rokoko
40,"very nice place, friendly atmosphere, good food , good prices, very good service, just that it can get noisy inside",Rokoko
40,I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.Very nice atmosphere and service. Quite relaxed and nice corner to enjoy your dinner. We ordered pasta salad and cocktails and they were yummy.May need reservation during weekend.4/5 stars is for the toilet...loved the design but was smelly :),Rokoko
50,"First of all I noticed the Friendy service by the waiters, warm environment and of course excellent food. Pasta was cooked to perfection and pizzas were the closest you can eat to the traditional Italian Pizza. Value for money. A place to visit.",Rokoko
50,"This place is a personal favourite since it first opened. It's impossible to list everything that's excellent about it: service, prices, quality and quantity of food. The fresh pasta dishes served are not the typical bolognaise/carbonara dishes, but they are all delicious. Their pizza is made before your eyes and it can't get any better. The desert menu is to die for (especially the Nutella calzone made in-house). Atmosphere is quirky, cheerful and young. It can get quite noisy if the place is full, but this is by no means the restaurant's fault.",Rokoko
50,"Friendy service, relaxed environment, excellent food. Pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauces were just right.Appetizers were ok, but quality of main dish overshadowed them.If you are out in Nicosia for Italian this should be one of your top choices",Rokoko
40,The food is quite good. In fact the pizzas and the pastas are very good. Overall it worths a visit but try to book outside because if dont you will not be able to hear yourself talk.....,Rokoko
50,"Excellent inviroment, excellent quality of food, value for money, excellent service, frendly inviroment",Rokoko
50,You can tell immediately that the team at Rokoko love what they do and are passionate about offering the best service and excellent quality food at very reasonable prices! Don't hesitate for a minute to have a great night out here!,Rokoko
50,"Visited here numerous times, the food is always tasty, starters are a good size to share.Pizzas are the highlight here, excellent dough with quality toppings, baked to perfection. The pastas are ok but do not shine here as much as the pizzas.I do recommend the hidden gem, the steak for 17 euro, tender and extremely tasty.For dessert they offer the fun option of the gianduja calzone, for sure a crowd-pleaser.They also do good cocktails.The decoration is youthful and fun, with a nice contrast of materials. Attention to detail is seen everywhere from the bar to the toilets.Service is usually great, we had a problem with our order one of the many times we have visited, but the manager made it right and took care of us.Overall a great place for a cool night out with tasty italian food. Very highly recommended.",Rokoko
50,"Rokoko offers amazing food and has great service. It is a very good restaurant and also lies in a good location in Nicosia.If you are there: try the Nutella calzone, it is the best I have ever had!The only minus point is that the place is quiet small, so it can get very loud.Everything else was great!",Rokoko
50,Everything was amazing! Food was really good and the staff very friendly. We tried pizza and pasta and both dishes were lovely.,Rokoko
50,"From the moment we walked in the restaurant the smell of fresh rocket and balsamic slapped our noses. At that point you know you are in for a treat.After two year of operation, the restaurant is very busy, revealing that they are doing something right in there, well, ROKOKO does a lot of things right.The excitement from all the staff can match the one of a newcomer, the waiters are extremely polite, fast and well trained, the owners are ever present to make sure that everything flows smoothly and that the patrons are having a good time.The food is excellent, nothing but fresh ingredients and amazing combinations of modern and classic, refreshing cocktails and the prices are extremely reasonable.I cannot wait to revisit, if we can find a table that is...",Rokoko
50,I have visited Rokoko a number of times and always had a nice experience. The food is nice and the staff is very friendly. They also have an excellent dessert - calzone with nutella and mascarpone cheese!,Rokoko

50,"One of the best places for dinner in Nicosia, nice environment and delicious food! Staff always friendly and helpful. If you are going Friday or Saturday better make a reservation one day in advance. The prices are very good for the food you get. The cocktails are also very good in very good prices too. Almost everything i have tried from the menu was tasty and perfectly cooked but the real highlight is the amazing Nutella calzone , is a must try :), and is enough for 2-3 persons to share it.",Rokoko
40,the meal was excellent the atmosphere fine and the service very friendly always with a smile. prices are competitively set.,Rokoko
50,Excellent place..warm environmnet with delicious food and at very low prices. Staff very friendlyand always polite!!!must give it a go and you will not loose!,Rokoko

40,"First time I went to rokoko, but the first thing I noticed was how cheap it was, I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. Second thing was the service, everyone was with a smile on their face and ready to serve you. The food despite being cheap was very good & the portions were enough to fill u up. There is also a great range of cocktails to compliment your meal, and although I didn't try the calzone mascarpone nutella, I definitely will the next time I go, as it looked absolutely delicious!",Rokoko
40,"Food is great, atmosphere is good and its a place you could come over again. Pitty its only open at nights. So if you are a lunch person this place will keep letting you down.",Rokoko
50,"This gem in the heart of Nicosia is definitely worth a visit! Pizza is by far the best I've tried on the island, and as a pizza lover I undoubtedly reccomend it! The cocktails were summerish and of a very reasonable price!Highly recommended!",Rokoko
50,the pizza are very tasty! its thin and crispy like the original ones in Italy! the prices of the pizzas are very reasonable and the size is generous!there is also unique pasta dishes on the menu that are also quite tasty!you should also try the new dessert on the menu that is like closed pizza with nutella! its delicious!the staff is very friendly,Rokoko
50,"Everything was exellent, from the perfect ravioli and the amazing pizzas to share. Reasonable prices..!! The waiters were very helpfully.",Rokoko
50,"Great and unique italian food! Everything was exellent, from the salads to the perfect pasta (cooked al tente) and the amazing pizzas to share. Great variety in the menu as well. This place also offers great coctails to complement your perfect meal! The highlight of the night was the desert, a type of clazone with praline filling, just mouthwatering! I would dare to say this was the best desert I ever had! It's what they say it was totally 'worth the calories'! Leaving without trying this desert would be a major ommission! :)))",Rokoko
50,No-rise thin and crispy pizza crust with high quality cold cuts. Order Rokoko (Pizza) or chicken rigatoni (pasta) and do not forget to ask for a chocolate calzone (sweet). For starters I would recommend spinach roll and eggplant fritters.,Rokoko
40,"Amazing pizza, great environment and the best dessert ever! Calzone with mascarpone and nutella :)))",Rokoko
50,A small but amazing restaurant with a great variety of pizzas and pastas. Amazing pizza with chicken at a very good price and also amazing dessert calzone with Nutella. Dont miss it.,Rokoko
50,"Its the third time we visited Rokoko and we are as impressed as the first time! Freshly made pizzas, great staff and reasonable prices! Worth a visit as its a modern place with attention to detail! Highly recommended !",Rokoko
40,Loved the relaxed atmosphere of this place. The eggplant dish and the vegeterian pizza we tried were quite good. The staff were very helpful and prises reasonable. The only problem was that the music was too loud.,Rokoko
40,"Excellent food at very decent prices, watching the pizzas being made is a treat too. Although the food was fantastic it took a bit longer than it should have (admittedly it was busy) to get to the table. The other thing that was a bit off-putting, was the fact that it was loud both the music and as a result the clientele. Despite this, I wouldn't say no to another visit",Rokoko
50,"Already been few times this year and we just love this place! Food is delicious, staff is so courteous and polite, and prices very reasonable! And last but not least the pizza is amazing!!",Rokoko
40,"We visited the place as soon as it opened back in the summer. My impression was not good at the time. The food was not great and my figs and prosciutto salad had neither fig nor prosciutto. I gave them a second chance and i must admit it was worth it. The pizza looked very good, my goats cheese salad was rich and tasty and my friend's gluten free vegetable pasta also looked and smelled good!Nice atmosphere and great music, but most of all very nice approach by the staff towards the clients. Will visit again",Rokoko
50,"Went with a friend for dinner based on recommendation. We shared a large and very tasty rocket salad to start and followed with a pasta dish and a steak dish with sweet potatoes. Wine by the glass was of very good quality. Meals were perfectly cooked (for our taste!), presented and the service was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there. The atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly. The music gets a bit loud but other than that, we were very impressed! Will definately go back! Very good value for money too!",Rokoko
40,"Ordered pizzas and pastas with friends, all of the food served in the right time. Tried the Rokoko and Paesana pizzas and Linguini and Salmon penne.",Rokoko
40,"Starters - The aubergine fritters are a must-try. The mushrooms not so much.Pizzas - good pizzas that could be even better. The spicy one is very nice, it has a bit of kick actually. The capricciosa was ok.Wine list - good wine list (18-35 euro)Ambiance - nice little terrace. The interiors are on the trendy/cool sideService - friendly but still needs fine-tunning eg not pick up the plates of clients that are done before the rest of the party has finished etcAnother positive is that there is a cool bar next door for those who want to continue their evening. I would put this restaurant between ""average"" and ""very good"". Overall, this is a good new place with room to improve.",Rokoko
40,A retro place which serves marvellous pizza and pasta! The pizza is cooked in a traditional over which can be seen from inside of the restaurant! The unique design in combination with the great food makes this place a must visit restaurant this summer. Unfortunately the service is a bit weak and needs improving but the food definetely makes up for it! The peanut butter cheese cake is a must try!,Rokoko
