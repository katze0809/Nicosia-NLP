30,The quality was not bad but was expecting more: the mussles were simply floaded by mayonnaise (the picture on the menu was without mayo). The staff was very kind and quite fast!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"This restaurant has a good location just of Ledra Street at the very end at the Greek side. Great food and attentive service, food is made from fresh.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,"This place seems to have gone down hill. The staff do not seem that in the ball and we were left a long time trying to get their attention. The food was also not as well presentwd as the old OB in Nicosia city.I only came back here once and it was enough to put me off making the same mistake twice. The prices are really steep as well, which never used to factor beforw. That's a shame as I used to really enjoy a good OB.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,Very poor portion and very expensive. Not value for money. Is just a franchise name and nothing else,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Quite good restaurant. Service is amazing. The food is not exceptional, but it's better than average. Sushi is very good I would say.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,This is one of the best food choices in the mall of Cyprus in terms of quality. Local and foreign seafood plates are available. However the views are not too great and a meal in downtown Nicosia (same brand is also available in Ledras Str) would be preferable for this matter...,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

The view was gorgeous and the music was pleasant.However, when I moved out, most of the tables were not clean. I found one that was acceptable, but it was not stable. Since I didn't notice, my beer spilled on the table but the waitress noticed and came to clean the mess.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

50,I am a huge fan of prawns and its platters. The way that the waiters treat the customers is very pleasant and made me to come back there for sure.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,"The food quality was very poor. We asked for a small bottle of KEO beer and the waitress said that they don’t carry any beer bottles even though it was printed in their menu. We said that clearly it has to be removed from the menu and her response was that the manager is aware of it and that she is just the waitress, there is nothing she can do about it. The food arrived late, and the quality of it was terrible.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Not bad at all especially for a casual meal after shopping. Very good value for money and tasty meals. Worth trying,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

20,"Good menu, but really fast food. If you like everything coming out of the chip pan, well , then it's your place.The dishes are designed for mass production, taste is just average.Staff can be friendly or not, depending on who looks after you. Staff is often stressed because of the crowds, prices are low.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,We have visited the restaurant in the tiwn and we where very pleased. When we visitd it at the Nicosia Mall we had a bad experience. The restaurant was very crowded and there was no place for us. We decided to order take away and sit at the public tables outside the restaurant. The food was late and the quality very poor. The most annoing thing was that we paid the price of the catalogue for the take away which it was ery expensive.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Nice and quick fish and other sea foods restaurant. Nice alternative to other fast foods. Easy going atmosphere and for a good lunch or dinner.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,I went there by myself for a lunch break. They have quite good starters options like shrimps with cheese and garlic. The food was good overall. The atmosphere was good as well.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

20,"I took my family here who were visiting from out of town. The staff are friendly and welcoming. I ordered a massive dish to feed four however when we tasted the shrimp there was an awful smell, the kind you get when the shrimp isn't fresh. I've been here before but this time was bad. My family also commented on the quality. The sushi was good and the village salad was a delight as usual, however the shrimp was a deal breaker.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,Great place To eat with awesome view. Our guid took us there for lunch and we couldn’t be more pleased.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Staff were very welcoming in this clean, modern restaurant and it was very encouraging to find Ocean Basket had a full allergens list available on request unlike many other restaurants in Cyprus. We enjoyed a relaxed lunch and the queen prawn and avocado salad was particularly enjoyable as a gluten free choice. Staff were friendly, helpful and chatty. Although much more expensive than the north of the island we would happily call in again.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,"The best thing about this restaurant is the friendly helpful Staff. I had Calamari whichwas tasteless and dry. My friend had the Cod and didnt enjoy it at all, as it was dry.Our food came up very quickly. But while waiting to eat, I noticed someone cleaning a tiledwall at the end of the restaurant with a squeezy mop! Couldn't this be done before customers arrive. I enjoyed the Tall Horse Chardonnay served by the glass.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"We preferred the grilled versions. With the two of us, one has chips and the other the stir-fried vegetable which we then share.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We must have visited Ocean Basket OB many many times over the years. This Summer hol (aug18) we visited Ocean Basket 3 times in 2 weeks. The Mall branch is new to us and as a family we did not like it. The order came wrong, the bill was also off and small little things did not seem smooth. eg one of the family was having sushi and this although we asked for all the food to come at the same time, we had to wait ages more for the sushi. Eventually we had to eat the hot stuff and only when they were clearing up our plates did the sushi arrived. The excuse was that our sushi was given to a different table. Go figure!!. And the bill was so wrong. The branch at Coral Bay in Paphos and Finigoudes in Larnaca faired better.Generally we like OB. The food is tasty but its not fresh fish. Its frozen but still good.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,I was there a few months back. The food at Ocean Basket was delicious. I usually like their big platters to share than their smaller one person meals. We arrived at night and it was jam packed. We were seated outside and there was much noise. Children running and yelling. I didn't like that there were cats eating all the food on the ground. It was not hygienic. The staff were busy and no one paid attention to the dirtiness of the floor. The food was wonderful and service was great.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Good food, nice deco, great experience for kids and adults. Highly recomendeded if you are into fish eating",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,I am not going to say much... just that this food is mot coming from the ocean... they definitely fry everything in totally burned oils... at least stop using this Med sauce on top of everything unless you have a specific reason to do it.. like give a taste to an un-taste-full sea food.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"A cheerful dinning experience with the seafood all you can find in the restaurant. Dishes fresh and perfect quality, choices in menu which attract family and friends to share the yummy.

40,"We visited Ocean Basket (opposite Mall of Cyprus) in early May. Staff is professional, patient and very polite. The restaurant is pleasant inside, clean and tidy. Seafood menu includes the well known fried fish, shrimps and squid plus some extra seasonal choices. It is generally known for it's deep fried' delicacies but customers can also find a fair choice of standard grilled fish and seafood. I would have liked to see more traditional mediterranean fish dishes and chips should be a bit more crunchy. Yet, for a mid-range chain restaurant, I believe it is well above the average, and I would consider it a safe bet.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Making a list of restaurants before traveling to Nicosia, my partner really liked the look of this place during our day trip here.As we popped in rather empty place, we were given a corner table which was a bit cooler in the hot mid day and ordered the platter for 2, plus lots of Cola and a shake which was great.The staff was very nice and friendly and the bill came just under 40 euros to which we added a tip as we were not charged for the tomatoes for example.Several places like this in Limassol apparently, however they were located downtown so could not try to go there in the May heat.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,great place..right near solomos..so perfect location..service could have been better..starter portions were a bit over priced for the size of the platter..best fish and chips ..i have had for quite some time..sit either in front of the place or inside..or be prepared to get bare service if you sit on the side street..still waiting for the tobasco and ketchup..,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We went there a Saturday night with my boyfriend...we didn't make a reservation and the lady at the reception told us that we could choose one of the tables that were available outside from the restaurant.. I didn't like the way she talked, I think it's kind of rude, like she didn't care if we choose to leave or not.. despite her behaviour we choose to stay. After a while a waiter came BUT he took the order of people who came after us and after a couple that was sitting next to us. The man next to us got angry but the waiter apologized because nobody told him where to go first and he went to table that was nearest the restaurant's door... Way to unprofessional from the manager or the receptionist, I don't know who told him just to go outside without letting him know where to go first... On the other hand the food was delicious, the waiter was very nice and he made sure that we have everything we needed.. and I recommend this restaurant...",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

20,"Service was good, but more or less that was about. We ordered platter, but the food that came was too oily. Prawns were small, and only because they cut them butterfly look bigger. The sauce( mixture of butter and garlic, or something simmilar) is heavy and not naturally tasty. A lot of potatoes.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

20,"used to be a friendly place but lately i got dissappointed as the prices are not value for money anymore especially for sushi, quality also is not as it used to be as they grew and become more industrial, service is professional though, they should reconsider prices",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Although I don't think this place counts as traditional Cypriot, I was very satisfied with it. When we went in they greeted us, asked us where we wanted to sit, and then brought the menus. All very friendly. They were very willing to tell us what was on the menu, and help us with any questions. They brought small starters, which was bread and margarine and three kinds of dips (garlic, chilly and something creamy). They were a bit puzzled at me wanting to take lots of pictures though, and sort of ushered me back to the table. But anyway. Everything in the menu sounded very tasty, and they had all sorts of fish, and sushi. The place-mat on the table was fabulous, lots of personality, and they even gave me one to take home with me! The food, when it came, was very tasty; it came in a big metal bowl/frying pan shaped thing. Very successful presentation. We also had sushi, for starters, and it was very scrumptious.. The shop inside, was full of character, very busy, and on the walls, it was full of quotes and drawings. Al the areas were labelled, for example ""Bar"", or ""Kitchen"". Very cute style inside in general. The bathrooms were perfectly adequate, stylish and clean. During our meal, they came and asked if everything was ok, if the food was tasty and everything, and because we liked the wasabi so much, they gave us some more in a little bowl! At the end, the bill came with a questionnaire and sweeties. All in all, quite a nice fishy experience!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,Good grilled squid; nothing more. Prawns are ok. Rice is good when it's not undercooked. Sushi is not exactly sushi.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"I know it's chain-y but I still wish we had OB in the UK. A great, family friendly, easy place to enjoy nice food. The portions are huge, especially the kids'.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,Fast food seafood chain. Buttery dishes mainly. Nothing special for dinner or lunch. Not my type of seafood restaurant.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

Excellent and fast service from the staff, wonderfull atmosphere inside and outside with a very good interior design decoration as well as plate decoration! I felt really excited from the moment i step in , i felt like i was on a fishboat travelling into the ocean , i was really impressed! The price of the food there is average not too expensive not too cheap.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Came here with colleagues for a seafood meal. Recommended to us by locals as prices are reasonable. We had a seafood platter for three and very enjoyable. It is not a fine dining experience but we sat outside and watched the world go by. Staff very friendly and would recommend for a reasonably priced seafood meal.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,A great place to have seafood at a reasonable price. The selection of sushi although not vert rich is adequate and of good quality. If you like salmon sashimi try the ponzu salad.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,"We were visiting this place for some years from the very beginning it opened. But the last year it became much worse than ever,as the quality of food they offer. Today i got really disappointed- we ordered take away for the daughter portion of calamari regular. The calamari were hard and didn't taste freshly done. As the portion they put in the box was size of a starter. For less money you can afford better quality from ""zorpas"" or ""pandora""...If they do not improve quality and service, they'll loose lots of clients.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Really good food and style. Easy going and relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced and good portion size.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"I passed by this restaurant many times but I never stopped. This time I decided to give a try : I was really happy and for sure I did not regret my choice. Very nice informal atmosphere, extremely good service and very clean too. Professional and very friendly waitress at the same time who was very helpful in her suggestions about food even if the menu was very well organized with both descriptions and photos of the plates. Really impressive the seared salmon salad ( salmon sashimi ). I loved the beer too ( Fix Dark from Greece ) which was perfectly pairing with my dishes. High standard and freshly cooked staff at very competitive prices.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We ate at the Ocean Basket three times while we were in Nicosia and Larnaca ! These restaurants are almost always crowded, and it is for a good reason. The seafood is good quality, well cooked, and good value.This is a chain restaurant (we also ate at Ocean Baskets in other countries), but we always left happy. The quality and standards are high, the service very good, and the food is always delicious.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"I come here for the sushi. They are tasty and very affordable! I am vegan and I eat the vegetable fashion sandwiches. To make it vegan make sure to request that they don't put mayonnaise. They also have the fasting version where they add an agent to keep the sushi together, which has a strong flavour that I wasn't very fond of. I also love the fries and their garlic and chilli dipping sauces for bread!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Ocean basket is a great cheap and tasty solution for seafood lovers. Fish fillet, shrimps, clams and mussels. But let's be honest. Their food is freshly cooked but not fresh. Over all is a great deal for friends and family.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

40,I have been a couple of times in what I call the McDonald's of seafood. Don't get me wrong the quality is not similar.Very nice seafood and good prices.

Creates an atmosphere that combines well.Highly recommended.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"There was a group of 6 of us for dinner and so we had a chance to order some of the platters and everything was great. We loved the oysters, mussels, cod and sea bass. We found it great value for money and the quality was very good. We are comparing to Dubai and so the prices were good if you included drinks also. After eating for dinner we had a chance to go back for lunch the next day for lunch before we flew out.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Nice decor, with perfectly spaced seating. Selection of sushi and mostly fried fish, shrimps, squid and mussels. The sauces accompanying them are divine. If you choose a platter (nice selections on those too) wisely then not only will you be stuffed, but also price per person (depending on your group) comes out to pretty low.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"This South African Restaurant Chain in Cyprus is as good or better than in its founding country.Simply Delicious & Very Well Priced this is a clean and comfortable casual environment for an extraordinary meal.The variety of fish including a specialty offering flown in from South Africa (Kingklip) is fantastic. Sole, Hake and other imported mouthwatering options including possibly local shellfish, calamari and more. Mostly all available either fried or grilled.The Greek Salad would make any local proud, and the chips, rice and other sides are also perfect.Their specialty seems to be the seafood platters which offer a large assortment of all of the top fish and seafood delights.Prices very well and affordable, this family style casual restaurant is great for a simply lunch, business lunch or dinner, or family feast.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"I visited this place for lunch, as I had to spend some time in Nicosia thinking of the next place to be visited. I ordered an Octopus fry dish as a starter. The staff was very good, even the chefs visited the table to ask me for the details on how to prepare and how to deliver the dishes to the table. Then I also ordered some line-fish dish as the main and some Bailey's vanilla shake. All the food was great, especially I loved those bread and sauces they usually offer once you sit there (free starter stuff).",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,Good quality of food and variety of fish and sushi . The only thing that i find a little bit bad is the price. You can buy a big platter which should feed 5-6 people but it doesnt really.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,The food is nice - specially the grill cod with rice. The selection of sushi is nice with great variety,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,We visited the Ocean Basket twice the last 2 months and our impression is bitter sweet.Too oily and garlic aftertaste feels a bit nasty,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Very nice place for friends and families! good choice of seafood and sushi, great service very attentive staff.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,The staff is completely lost. Our server spoke no English. The backup had the personality of one of their dead fish and the other server decided to open the side door to make the place freezing cold. The food was pretty tasty. The servers could not be located for follow up drinks. They were really unfriendly. Perhaps the most unfriendly servers we have experienced in Cyprus.So. I fine it two stars for the food quality and zero for the hospitality. Go across the street to Wagamama. You will be happier.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"fresh fish and very nice place for families and couples , nice atmosphere, fast and kind service . Very nice platters !",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

50,Lets start with negatives...music is terrible. Food is decent. The sushi not that bad. I do have sushi once a month here. All other platters are average but on the positive side of average. Shrimp melts under overcooking but still tastes good.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Went for an early evening meal with my wife and had the place to ourselves to start with. By the time we left the restaurant was very busy which illustrated it's popularity. Food was very good and portions were large. Not being much of a fish eater I just had a salad and it was one of the best of many I have enjoyed in Cyprus. Staff were pleasant and attentive.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Have preferred the Onasagora Street ""sister"" of the first Ocean Basket (of Themistokli Dervi) because it is quiter and easier to find a place most of the time. Last night, my Australian friend and I were quite pleased with the Salmon Steak (with both rice and french fries), the dish of fried vegetables, the glass of Cypriot wine, and the friendly sevice. Maybe the price of the main course was slightly higher than expected; and I am still wondering why the bread with the initial dips remains so...white and so sad (as I have written before). Overall, however, it does qualify for very good.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Generally Ocean Basket food is more fried and based on butter rather than grill and lemon like the typical fish tavern, but it's still delicious. The platters are always good and very filling. I think platters are probably their best dish. Definitely recommend!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We were passing and heard from friends that it was a good restaurant. We had the platter for 2 and there was enough for both of us while leaving some chips and rice. Wine was very good, could have drunk more of it and I don't drink usually. Will go again. The service was very good",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

30,"The restaurant mostly seemed like a quick fish n' chips, instead of a restaurant to seat and enjoy food. The menu was good, but related to the category of fish n' chips. Everything frozen. Would definatelly go for a quick sea food choice, but not really for an evening out to dinne.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,Its a good restaurant for fast food fish. It has delicious food and its fast to eat. Clean and ok servise. Good cakes.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"Not bad fish, but most of the plates are similar. The options are in the combinations mostly. It tastes good, the prices are not bad and the service is ok. The problem is that you have to wait long to be sitted and on Sunday you never find a table!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Great value for money, it is not expensive, and food is great! we love the shrimps there, must visit while exploring Nicosia, staff is also friendly and nice, very clean",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"I ve been there twice with some friends and my family. It's a fast food chain, serving probably frozen sea food. I'm not a big fan of sea food in general, so for me it's not a big deal. Most of the platers have 2 side dishes, rice and chips which were always cold. Sushi is good. Their plates are overpriced in my opinion, however, the staff is good and friendly.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,Been there 5 times. Food tastes ok but same menu for a long time. It is not a quality food restaurant.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Not ver far from the town or street I would say in ideal location.I must say it is well maintained very clean and friendly staff.The spacious room bottom and first floor.I think price is reasonable.Very well served and joyful staff.Environment is quiet good not very crowded and noisy.Been twice already looking forward to go again.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

40,"Nice selection of sushi and sashimi. Great platters with combinations of calamari,shrimp and fish. Sometimes the garlic sauce in the platters is a bit overwhelming but then you come back for more! Prices are ok, service is very good. Also, quality and taste of food has been very consistent over the last 2-3 years we've been dining here.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Found in several locations on the island, the restaurants are clean and neat, more so than some of the neighboring establishments. They purvey sushi (didn't try it but that's not what I came to Cyprus for) as well as local seafood. Time was short and so I settled upon fish and chips, which were quite good and better that the average fast food places serving the same.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Good food nicely cooked and presented and good value for money at a pleasant enviroment. Excelent service with polite waitresses.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,Ocean Basket's food is excellent. The only problem you will have at your visit here is to decide what to choose from the menu. Everything is delicious. The atmosphere and the service are very good.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"They have delicious sushi platters. I prefer their shrimp tempura sushi platter (the one in the photo). Moreover, they have delicious fish platters and their mussels are very tasty. It's not like eating in a tavern, but still they have tasty fish in good prices.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,We found a black hair on the food. Also a couple with two children seating near us ordered sushi and found two black hair on their food. The Manager said that maybe the chef unfortunately put a shrimp that drop to floor into the plates. In my opinion it was a horrible mistake to pay for the food but I did.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,This is a fast food joint with fish instead of meat. The food is full of grease and you can taste the heavy taste of fried oil. Not recommended if you really like fish. Ok for a fast bite,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Excellent sushi!! The staff is very friendly. A bit overpriced. Nice cold drinks. It worths a visit.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"Seemed like a fast food fish restaurant for me, the platters have a good variety but a little quantity and moreover the prices are really high! The food is not the freshest and some of the food is even frozen",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We visit this reasturant quite a lot and do take away. Considering that most of its food comes frozen (what a pity!) it tastes exceptionally fresh. There are some mixed platters that are of great value, starting at 14.50 for 1 person.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,In nicosia a fast food type restaurant of great variety of sea food an sushi! Very busy so you have to make a reservation! Clean place with good service and nice prices! Although the parking in the area might be difficult,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,The family platter which says services 4 it's hardly enough for 2! Service is poor ... food late to arrive and over priced! If you love to eat seafood this is not the place to choose. I was disappointed.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Nice food combinations. The combined dishes with fish is an excellent choice, great seafood with very tasty prawns.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,Its a good place with upgraded menu and healthy choices. Food is late but the service is good and the quality is always superb.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

40,Very nice place to go eat and have fun. The food and service is very good. The staff is friendly and the prices are okay. Definitely give this one a try if you like fish. (And get a shrimp platter),Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,"The service was surprisingly slow and poor. The staff took little to no interest in serving us at all; we had to wait for the menu, the food, and the bill, in a way that is not consistent with the Ocean Baskets concept. When we asked for the dessert menu, the waiter only gave us a glare and grudgingly returned a few minutes later. We sat at the bar and dined for a few hours, and in that entire time the two chefs said nothing to each other and generally looked disinterested in being there at all. The waiter at the entrance simply looked bored and sighed every few minutes, it would almost be impossible to look more acidic and apathetic. The sushi was good but the dessert we ordered was out of stock and we had to settle for some mediocre ice cream. One waiter spilled wine all over the table and another waiter almost poured wine in the handbag of one of our guests.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,"Plastic prawns , chips and pretty much everything else.Served on one of the oiliest platters I've ever tasted, even the oil was cheap. Cheap as their prices.. I guess you get what you pay for, but seafood is not that cheap everywhere else for a reason.Its beyond my reasoning why people would feed their children this rubbish foodFrozen food, frozen taste, frozen review",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We were in Nicosia, Cyprus for over a week. Our first restaurant was an expensive one, and we went there twice. The first visit was exceptional; the second, the food was sub-standard. Then we found Ocean Basket, and we ate there nearly every day of our remaining days in Nicosia. My wife especially liked the salmon - always fresh, and always perfectly cooked. I tried various dishes and everything was good. The sushi was o.k., not particularly authentic, but the other seafood dishes were very good.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,I visit the one at Ledras and feel to like it better than the another one in Nicosia. At Ledras there are more care and attention to each guest. Even in busy evenings their service level does not shrink at all. Meal sizes are very large and always tasty. Waiting staff is caring and attentive.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,Great chain of restaurants ensuring good fish plates mainly on shrimps & sushi. Quality and price balance nice environment. Need to reserve table on weekends,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,We have visited ocean basket (ledras)on Sunday two families with 3 kids for food and maybe some fun for the kids...unfortunately the play ground for the kids was not there!!!!The food is okay for its standard however a bit overpriced (specially the sushi).Service though was very good and helpful.Now for my title...we as families prefer restaurants with play areas so that we can also enjoy a meal while the kids are playing....ocean basket (ledras) did had one but removed it since some parents fight with each other after a misunderstanding with their kids!!!!I don't think that by removing the play area will solve the problem but will result in less families visiting the restaurant...I believe mgt could have taken a better decision and keep the play area.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Two and a half months after my first visit at this restaurant (which differs from its ""sister"" at Themistokli Dervi Street), my friend and I were quite pleased with what we got which was exactly what we expected. In other words, the food was good and plenty (so much that after sharing 18 prawns and french fries we had difficulty to finish the rest), and the service was more friendly than usual. Again, however, that initlal bread for the nice dips is unnecessarily white and...sad.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,The food was excactly as expected.. The menu was so diverse u wouldn't know what to pick. We had sushi and their daily platter .. Amazingggg their salads are amazing! Do choose some sushi.. Very good maki rolls,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"After hearing so much about this restaurant from my family I thought it was finally time to give it a go... And to my convenience this one was located very easily unlike the one in Larnaca.I visited this branch with my mum and aunt, and boy I must say ... IT WAS AMAZING.We visited on a thursday afternoon, and it wasn't too busy, only about 5 tables.We sat down and immediately the waiters were introducing themselves too us and asking us how our day has been.After having a look at their menu, we decided too have 2 Portions of Californian Roll, one with salmon and one with prawn, and they were absolutley delicousss.and We got a Full Deck PLATTER too share. And it was more then enough.We got a takeaway Full Deck to take home. and a bottle of wine and the desserts and coffees were on them.. and in total we only paid €134.Definitley worth the visit, im here for another 2 weeks and will be visiting 2-3 more times, minimum!!!!Thank you for the excellent service and food!!!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,"Didn't like it at all, alla the combo plates have a special sauce that I hate. Bad taste, frozen food",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,I really love the fish platter. I am not a fan of their sushi. But their prawns with the garlic sauce are just awesome!! Would definitely come back!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"I have spent 3 days in Nicosia, and ate for three days in this restaurant. The food is very tasty, portion is big, service is excellent and staff are friendly. as for the price is ts average.I recommend this restaurant for fish lover especially platter combo 2 which is more than enough for two and has good combination of fried and grilled calamari, shrimp, mussels with garlic sauce, french fries and rice, in addition to salad.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,"average service , the food wasnt hot as well and not delicious enought , maybe if this fixes would be a nice place for fish .",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"The food is great and the prices are very reasonable! They serve here very large portions ( the ""soul mate platter"" is highly recommended for 2). I'll keep on coming back each time I'm NICOSIA.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"The food is ok but not as cheap as many say since you need to pay 15euro for a fish and some fries . The platters for two or more do not have enough food for 2 adults so you either need to get something extra or leave form there and few hours later have something else to eat. The price we pay for 2 persons is the same as any other restaurant.If you are not a fish lover then going here is a good choice since the only fish you can eat is Cod fillet or the fish of the day fillet. We suggest you get the Cod. The other options is calamari (fried,grilled), muscles with garlic sauce and shrimps different sizes accompanied with yellow rice or fries.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"We visited Ocean basket because we were invited by some friends that go there often. We chose the variety for 2 so we could try all of their dishes. It's your normal fish restaurant, there is a smell of fried oil but it's not that overwhelming. The decoration is really nice and you get the sense that the waiters are always there if you need them. The salad was OK, nothing special and the three ""dips"" they offer you don't worth the dip. Our variety cost 26E and the plate was filled with fries, mussels, cod, calamari and grilled shrimps. Overall tasty but average. The mussels didn't feel so fresh (had an overpowering garlic/butter sauce) and everything else tasted more oil than fish. The grilled shrimps were a good distraction from the oily plate.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,We had a party of 27 people. It was a bit of chaos when it comes to paying our bills since we all paying separately. But the food was fabulous. We had a platter of grilled seafood for 2. It was so fantastic. My favorite was the prawns. They were very yummy. The rice was very good also. We were all very happy with our dishes.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,Great selection of fish (all frozen). Almost all plates are either deep fried or very oily. Not the healthiest place to eat and as expected the quality is average at best. It's the Mc Donalds of fish taverns!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Nice place valued by local people so for me this is positive sign, second floor kids playroom. Good food, average price.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"We were staying at the Centrum Hotel at the top end of Ledra Street and this was the first restaurant that we came across when we left the hotel for our evening meal. There is an extensive sea food menu, the staff are attentive and very friendly and the service was excellent. My wife is a coeliac and the staff fully understood here problem, ensuring that she had a gluten free meal. As for the food, it was excellent. The only problem was deciding what to eat as there are so many choices. We would certainly go there again.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

40,"The new ""Ocean Basket"" at Onasagorou Street, next to Ledra Street, may prove a strong competitor of its older sister at Themistokli Dervi. Last night, the Starboard Platter for Two was a wonderful combination of Seafood to satisfy even high expectations. Service -as with our Gavriela- was friendly and professional while all staff looked well-chosen for the job. As for the prices, they remain very satisfactory indded. If I need to express a minor complain, the initial bread, provided for the dips, could be more fresh and less white...",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

50,"We've been having lunch almost every Sunday at the Ayia Napa, restaurant. The staff is very very friendly and food excellent for the money spent.

50,Always enjoy going to Ocean Basket. The kids enjoy it too and usually ask for it. Great place to have prawns. Very good!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"The minus points are the parking - so one is stressed before arriving, and the lack of sea. The other branch in Larnaca is on the beachfront and has a different chef! The twice I've been here, the food didn't measure up- was served luke warm rather than really hot. Portions were also not the same size -Still though, it's the best place to eat fish in Cyprus and the most reasonable. The service is better in Nicosia.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"We are in Nicosia with our friends, OB was referred to us to dine in, at first sight it's very spacious, cosy and clean.Staff is very welcoming and friendly.

For sure we will go daily .Enjoooooy.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We enjoyed good food and very pleasant staff and good service at this restaurant. There are wide range of sea food dishes available, and our meals were beautifully cooked. Prices were very reasonable, but the restaurant lacked atmosphere. We visited at a very quiet time of year, and things may be different at busier periods.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,Very good service and nice environment. However the food served is not great quality and the prices could be a bit lower.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,Several times we ordered for take away but yesterday came in for a dinner. Surprisingly there were little people so it was rather quiet and the food came quickly. Kids menu dish was delivered very very quickly) Salmon and combos were as good as usual (calamari are very tender) and codfish was enjoyed by our daughter as well. The interior is bright and funny and the staff are helpful so our evening was pleasant.But this popular restaurant doesn't have a parking and that's bad because of its central location((,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"This is a place where whatever you order has the same taste and its a pity. Fish, shrimps, even mussels taste the same. It is a pity because it has great service and very reasonable prices.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

40,"We ate at the Ocean basket restaurant just today; my wife and I, and our 2 year old daughter. The service was excellent, and the food too. The bill came to 30 Euros, and for a fish meal for 2 people, that is truly excellent.My only complaint is that they have no facilities for a father wishing to change his baby! The baby-chaning facilities are in the ladies' toilets. That is sexist, and insensitive to the needs of a father with a child.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

10,"After waiting for an hour the food never arrived so we just got up and left.When we asked before they said they were busy that's why there was a delay, which they should have warned us about. It was a Saturday late afternoon so I've seen busier times.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"I clearly place it in the fast-food category. It is OK if you are up for quickly prepared fish and of not so good quality. Squid and muscles are OK, the prawns are low quality and not properly cleaned. Cod fish is OK. Given all these, they should consider lowering their prices.Certainly not value for money.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Cheapest place in nicosia where you can eat nice fish. Their fish is frozen but very nice. The platters are amazing for families and friends. The service is good and friendly. Would recommend it to everyone.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

The prices are reasonable. The presentation was beautiful. Highly recommended place.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

40,"The place is clearly popular, and we popped in on a Saturday night and had luckily booked a table as the queue was pretty solid when we arrived and still as we left, so if you can, try and book as waiting times can apparently be an hour. Shows how popular it is.We ordered a sushi platter and a fish platter which fed us all (3 adults and 1 5 year old) easily with quite a bit still being left as we were so full.It was all very tasty and the garlic sauce is just so delicious, we ordered more.Staff are very nice and the place is airy and atmosphere is buzzy.My only minor quibble was, despite added sauce, sushi was slightly on dry and bland side. Not horrible, but just not the greatest I've had.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"I ate there a few times, but actually way before October 2014, but the calendar built into this application won't allow me to check an earlier date. Anyway...all my meals were melt-in-your-mouth-delicious and the the service was always top notch. I usually went with a Cypriot-American friend who turned me on to Ocean Basket, because she loved their food so much. Once I went with a British friend. We always had good experiences. The sushi bar is fun; you can sit and watch the sushi chef making the rolls and other beautifully decorated plates of sushi.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

40,"This restaurant offers plentiful food with good quality fish at very reasonable prices. Though crowded most of the times the setting is such that dinning is enjoyable.

There is a variety of well prepared platters: Shrimps of various sizes, squid, fish, sushi, etc and salads; you can also enjoy the well known fish and chips. Wine and other drinks are also served in the restaurant room which is always full of people of all ages - so make a reservation before going. The service is good, the waiters are trained and always ready to come to you, although sometimes it is not easy for them because of the many tables they have to serve. Also something the management has to pay attention is the noise in the room. Finally, I may understand the way the Management plays on words and English letters on the posters in the room and the menu, but for Cypriots they do not mean a lot of things.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Not exactly traditional cypriot fish tavern but all family members from 5 to 50 years old can find something to eat. Good service even if is Sunday and is fully booked. Nice, friendly waters, food is fine, prices are ok. Overall a positive experience.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

They now make some new sushi, and it was the BEST sushi I have eaten! And the sushi-prices are big, so we ordered all together 32 pieces of sushi split between three persons and we left with a FULL stomach!

40,"The place looked beautiful from the outside and I was in the mood for something light like sushi and my friend for seafood. Since it had started to rain hard it was a good escape also.The service was prompt and the menu is very nicely designed with a super selection of all things from the sea. Good choice of sushi combos at nice prices so I ordered the Chan's platter and my friend ordered one of the seafood platters also at a good price with a lot of variety.The menu says that good food sometimes takes a long time to cook. Well at least we were forewarned and it did take a long time. My sushi came first and I politely waited for his platter which came about 10 minutes later. The sushi was quite good and filling. My friend liked the seafood platter although it was heavily deep fried,All in all it's a good value and worth a visit. Be prepared to wait a bit but they've got a good selection of wines and beers, so sit back and enjoy.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"It is a great place that you are going to eat some good food. Not vast variety of food, as all of the foods are based on shrimps, calamari, and fish fillet.Call before going and make a reservation. Usually it is full and I do not get it why they do not open another one in the town.Prices are good, but not that cheap.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Good and quick service. Big portions. All seafood and good quality. Very nice combo plates to share. Downside is all fried stuff and sushi is not the best choice in this restaurant,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

30,"It would not be my first choice but we have a daughter who insits we visit. The Branch we usually use is situated in a shopping mall, and the surroundings are not exactly salubrious. The tables are crowded together quite tightly. For those who think babies being breastfed in a resturant is a no-no, (and i do not have a problem with that) what i am sure many would find (even more) off-putting (as i did) was the lady on the next table changing a festering nappy, though i am not sure if the resturant toilet facilities are suitable for this. The gents certainly are not. Service was acceptable but the staff looked rushed. Food (we had a Japanese style Sushi type of dish ) was OK, but nothing outstanding, however the prices were not outrageous and it was still reasonable value for money.Would I go again? Yes, if my daughter insists.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Went there for lunch, eating veggie lead to a nice cheese salad and extra chips, food was fine, surrounding is . bit fastfoodish, recommendable for quick lunch, not more, not less",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"We have been there many times, mainly with friends that do not like to spend a lot of money on a meal. The restaurant is bright, colourful and clean. The service is mostly attentive and good. Prices are reasonable. But yes, all is made of frozen fish which is almost unavoidable with the large selection of dishes of seafood and fish, You get what you can expect and pay for.My worst experience once was sushi. I ate tuna and the texture was weird. I asked the waiter if this was fresh fish or frozen and he admitted that it was frozen. This is unforgivable for sushi!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"Even though the atmosphere and the service of the restaurant is of a really good standard, the food served is not of a quality that matches its price. The fish doesn't taste fresh.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"Good marketing efforts, clean interior. But terrible quality for the price charged. They offer frozen fish which has no nutritious value at almost fresh fish prices. Frozen Pangasius sourced from Asia is not quality. Sushi is not that good either.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We go there at least once a week because its next to my fiancés work! It has very resonable prices, the food is nice and always more than enough, the atmosphere is nice and they always make you feel welcome!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

50,Created specifically for those looking for a uniquely quick fish & sushi taste experience at the city center!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,Good value for money and excellent service. People running this business know and love what they are doing. Highly recommended if you want to have good quality fish/sushi at great value.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

30,"I have been to the restaurant with my family a lot of times. The service is always excellent and the staff very friendly. The menu have a lot of different kind of fish, prawns and sushi. Ι would like to propose to add to the menu children's meals. Τhe only bad thing I noticed was, that the last time we went, the quantity of food served has decreased.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"i've been to nicosia's ocean backet restaurant (a lot of times) which is very good and easy located near centre of town. the service needs little bit improvement (to be faster when is groudy) but generaly is a nice decorated, big portions of food and tasty and nice deals. try the susi bar as well. i recomended it for ocean food in town. nice for lunch and dinner as well",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Always friendly staff, good service, no long waiting time for drinks or food. Been here several times, you can both get separate and shared meals - a lot of different kind of fish/prawns or even sushi!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,I ate here with extended family. There were about 20 of us.We were accommodated easily and the food was yummy. The sushi was pretty good. I was sceptical at first but really pleasantly surprised.I ate an an ocean basket the year before in Agia Napa region and couldn't fault that either. Although I was pregnant at the time so didn't eat sushi.I also can't comment on value as it was paid for by other family members on both occasions.Well worth a trip.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"I went to ocean basket's restaraunts and i found them always clean,the service is good and the food nice.i ll think that is a value for money restarant.is one of my choices when i go out with my family to eat.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"I have been to this restaurant many times and never had a bad meal, service is excellent and very friendly staff.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,This fish restaurant is value for money. The variety is overwhelming and the French fries out of this world! You should visit it at least once a month!!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,I visit this restaurant often. Good fish quality and well cooked. The service is good but no parking is available nearby. no wifi available as well. Good location in the centre of the town,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Nice fish, very good service, family restaurant,outdoors taples,good atmosphere and most importan smiling people to serve you!!!!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We ordered for 4 adults and a child. Not a big table. They forgot to bring salat, waiter was not paying attention to us to see if we need anything, and service is too slow. Apart from that the food was delicious, big portions, served visually acceptable way. We sat outside so I can't really comment about inside of the place.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,",Reminiscent of USA & New England sea food houses, nice staff, good service & a real change from fish meze..fair prices & attentive service..",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,The prices are ok but the quality of the food reflects the amount you pay. Most of the food is fried and not on the grill. If you are looking for quality fish food I believe it will not satisfy your needs.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,The food was poorly cooked like an amateur cooked it. And the food its not even fresh so its not that hard.. i was disappointed but the sushi with shrimp that we order was fairly good.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,Service is very bad and the waiters are rude. We ordered a platter and sushi. Sushi never came. This restaurant is really bad!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"my friends said so many nice things about this reastaurant that me and my husband said we had to go. I love prawns and other sea food. The prices were ok the staff was friendly, the place was nicely decorated.The thing that was missing i think was the quality of food. It was life a fast food but instead of hamburger there was calamari etc.I know its going tosound funny but i didnt feel as if i was going to a fish restaurant. It certainly smelled like one!It looked clean and likei said it depends on what you are looking for. There isn`t much sea food selling restaurants in Nicosia but calling this restaurant a sea food restaurant would be unfair to restaurant owners that actually cook real fish! my husband couldn`t finish his food. We got a dogy bag. Lucky our cat :) I didn`tenjoy my lunch much but i hope you do :)",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,Inside the restaurant smells so fishy :/ we ordered the platter for two. My husband and i do not eat big portions so we supposed that it was going to be enough. Well it wasn't. Probably is because the fish wad terrible and we couldn't eat it. Shrimps average... Calamari ok... Potatoes horrible... We ended up ordering extra 12 maki.. They were ok. Service was ok.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Probably not very suitable for the health conscious, as there’s copious use of frying oil, but for anyone else looking for a pleasant place to eat seafood at reasonable prices, it’s a good choice. The staff could be a bit more organised, but all in all we enjoyed our visit.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"I visited First ocean basket Ayia Napa, Protaras and Limassol. Compared to them, the food quality is poor (vegetables) and not cooked the same way. Staff is unprofessional and below average.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Even thow it's a chain restaurant its platters are delicious! The prices are fine and the portions size are good! Moreover, the price of the wine bottles are cheap compared to other restaurants and their wines very nice!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
10,Probably one of the worst restaurants I have been. Sushi is just not eatable. The rest of the food is very greasy and if you are a health oriented person is not for you. And its not just greasy is bad oil probably cooked from oil that was used on previous days. I have been there once and its just not an option for me again. I ordered shrimps with rice steamed and I the shrimps came with their cover so it took ages to peel them so I didnt enjoy that at all.Definitely not my style i would prefer to have a sandwhich from a kiosk.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Family visit to this nice restaurant. ""Fast-food"" idea of fish food but quite delicious. Great selection at reasonable prices. They offer unique combinations and cooking styles of fish. Would definitely go back.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Wanna eat seafood in Cyprus? One of the best choices is Ocean Basket. You 'll find fresh fish and seafood, perfectly cooked, and just delicious! Also, generous quantities in good prices... I love their platters! Bonus: nice place with friendly staff.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"You can have fish for lower prices. Service is acceptable. I did not enjoy the overall atmosphere. Food is rather oily for my taste. Smelly also - should you enjoy the smell of cooked fish, this is the place to be. We were invited there by friends. Kids enjoyed the food.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"nice atmosphere, food good and prices reasonable. Definitely for lovers of fish or Sushi as I dont eat either very much being a vegetarian, I can not comment on the taste",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Fast and friendly service, good value for money and tasty fish, seafood and sushi. Good South African wine too. One can really enjoy it, if one does not believe frozen is lower quality than fresh fish or seafood products! It is recommended to make an advance reservation though, especially over the weekend for lunch as the restaurant becomes very busy with families. Ask also for oysters; they are every once in while there swimming in the tank!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,I highly recommend the Sushi plater. Very good seafood platers and in a good prices.very friendly staff,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"I actually miss the taste of food I can have here. For seafood lovers, it's the best modern version of a seafood tavern, a loved destination for shrimps and squids. I didn't try the fish fillets except for some in the platters, but I absolutely love the squids: grilled, fried, different sauces. Be prepared to maybe get a bit smelly from the food getting prepared.Absolutely love this place, maybe I should arrange to go again soon!",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,So if you want to spend nice time with friends and family Ocean Basket is the place! Great food and great environment!!!!!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Actually, the cheapest fish restaurant in Nicosia (not to say in Cyprus) but the food is perfect as well as the atmosphere. It has nothing to do with a fast food restaurant though. I love starter dressings and king prawns for main course. Baby crabs as a starter are also a must! Portions are also large and filling. The only drawback is that you have to wait a lot in order to find a table (I think that they don't accept reservations but you had better call them and ask them to avoid the long waiting).",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,Fish quality is average and not as good as the SA restaurants. Quite good value for money. Good size portions.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"We visit there regularly either with family or friend. We consider it as a family restaurant, where you can go casually dressed. Food is very nice, always as expected. Me and my husband always order sushi which has never dissappointed us. My children order their delicious platters or their cod plates.We greatly appreciate that they prepare vegan sauce for us, during fasting periods !One point for improvement is the time delay while waiting for the food, especially in busy periods. Also, I believe their prices could be lower based on the type of food offered.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,very large portions of food of great quality. fish is perfect and served hot. the only drawback is the service that takes long to bring your food. thats why 4 stars and not 5. however is one of my favourite!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"To be sure, we knew that this attractive place does not pose as a posh establishment. But, contrary to some superficial comments, it looks, and when we visited today, it was, far better than a ""fastfood"" restaurant for fish. The genuinely warm welcome by Aristotle, the manager, was part of the success of our visit. The other parts included the excellent shrimp and calamari dish, the pleasant cod with rice and french fries, the friendly service by Maria from Crete, the ""generous"" portions of all dishes, and the extremely affordable prices.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"Visited on a saturday for lunch with my wife. The place wasn't packed but it was fairly business. The service was very good fast and efficient. Food was again good (for what it is) and the price was fair. There is nothing I can complain about regarding the restaurant. HOWEVER, everytime I have gone there there are screaming kids running around out of control. On this particular visit we were sat near the stairs, next to a table with 2 families. Their children were stomping up and down the stairs shouting and screaming. The parents obviously saying nothing while their children were disturbing everyone. There were another two young couples sitting at the tables around us who looked pretty annoyed as well. The manager or waiter never attempted to ask the children to calm down and later when I mentioned this to the waiter he said that they don't dare say anything to the parents. I can appreciate this is a ""family"" restaurant but perhaps they can find some way to accommodate other customers who wish to have a quiet and relaxing meal.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,I heard good recommendations about this restaurant but its definitely not what i expected. The food was average and the fish was not fresh. Disappointing..,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,A fantastic restaurant with phenomenal service. A rare gem in Nicosia and definitely worth a visit. This is a regular venue for me and you can also collect for those times you wish to eat at home.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"Good for a quick lunch Waiter are fast, food is coming quickly Service is good You dont expect much from this place, just everything fried!!! Prices are almost OK, little expensive for frozen fish",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"I went once, with friends for lunch.The food was tasty, too many garlic sause, the prises good.I would like to explain for those who will go for the first time, that this is not a Fish-tavern, and they don't serve fresh fish. Is like a fast-food quality, in four or five kinds of fish, like kalamari, fillet, prowns,oysters and mussels served with fried potatos and garlic sause. The prices are goodaverage service, clean pleasant large area.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,"Visited Ocean basket after some time for a Friday night dinner with friends. We had reserved some spots on the Sushi bar so that we could have quick access to the sushi there.The place was packed like there was a wedding party going on there. Our seats were the first seats next to the entrance where 10-15 people were standing at any point in time during our 2 hour lunch to be seated or to get their take-away orders.This was really frustrating. We were constantly pushed by people coming in and going out trying to go through the croud at the entrance.Now, the food... We booked the sushi bar and we almost did not have any sushi!!!! The sushi chefs(2 at the time) were working at 120% of their skills to prepare the orders coming from the waiters. This did not allow them to take care of the sushi bar, so no sushi was available for a long long time. To add to that, they even took plates off the sushi bar to finish any incomplete orders they had leaving us to wait for our turn...The main dish was unacceptable. The taste we valued on our last visit is now gone. The garlic sause is tasteless, the fish is overcooked and the fries or rice are obviously cooked in such large quantities that taste is lost somewhere in the process.The restaurant is always packed. I hope quality gets better soon. I would not recommend it for any other reason except for fast food dining.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"The restaurant Ocean Basket is very nice, with welcoming staff and of good quality for money.I was there off-season – but despite that, the atmosphere was still a bit hectic. That might be because of the restaurant also delivers take-away; which seems to be very popular. The restaurant is an informal fish and seafood restaurant with a sushi bar.If you want quietness and a romantic atmosphere, you should explicitly ask for a quiet place in the back of the restaurant. Remember also to ask for it, if you want your fish grilled.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"One of the best Value for Money restaurants in Nicosia. The shrimps and calamari are excellent, and the sushi is not bad as well! The staff is friendly and the managers are very polite. The lack of Greek speaking staff (not the managers) can become a problem for some people though..",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"As a resident of South Africa the food at Ocean Basket in Larnaca beats that of its parent restaurants overseas.Excellent position on sea front, helpful and accommodating staff. The menu is varied and the staff are happy to mix and match. The food itself is very fresh and cooked to perfection.A wonderful ***** experience.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Our third or fourth visit was the best one yet. Everybody had the Kalamari & Shrimp combo. Kalamari was tender and tasty, as were the shrimps. Service was very good. Although the restaurant was packed, food was delivered promptly. The quality of the food was certainly better than our previous visits and as the prices are quite reasonable, this is now a good place to eat certain types of fish.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"This is a fine informal fish and seafood restaurant with a sushi bar. I love oysters and this is one of the very few places in Cyprus where you can get oysters and the price is very reasonable. The only observation is that most of the fayre is fried. They do grill if you ask. The prices are very reasonable. This is the place if you want informal, fun seafood and fish, with friendly fast sevice. I have nort tried the sushi, my family and friends have and they enjoyed it. Recommended for a simple night out or indeed for lunch.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"I have been to this restaurant about 5 times now. It is very consistent, and the staff are great. Price is very reasonable and you get a lot of food for the price. The sushi keeps getting better everytime I go. Oysters are very good too. Its a good place to take kids as the service is speedy and a nice atmosphere for them,",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Nicosia Ocean Basket has the best sushi chef EVER! Always fresh fish and good atmosphere! I still remember it was a Fish festival, there were a lot of contests, prizes and amasing show of cutting\dressing of the fish by George.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"The restaurant is nice and colorfull. It is lovely place especially when the weather is good and you can sit outside. But the food is not high quality, actually is like ""fast food"". All the foodstuff used is frozen , if you don´t eat is while is warm, don´t try to eat when is cold, especially the fried potatoes.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"Yes, its quick, its tasty, its fresh and....I'd continue to go back. In fact, I have...many times.....it is great is you want a quick lunch but equally, it is great to entertain family, friends and guests. I think the guy spend some time in South Africa where he came up with the idea and he has carried the theme of the restaurant, very well. A good tip.....the owner gets fresh oysters flown in from Holland on a Tuesday's and therefore has them for offer at the restaurant during the rest of the week..of course, it is supply and demand so, first come, first served. Their 'green - back' mussels are great and all of the food 'hits-the-spot'......sushi available too but not the reason to go.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"I was just passing and, liking fish, thought I'd give it a try. I had a great welcome from the staff and could not fault the service. I just had plain old fish and chips. They were served in a hot pan and tasted just fine. Wine by the glass was entirely acceptable and I left with good memories of the whole experience. It might disappoint some gourmet diners but at the price, it cant be beaten in my view. Oh, and I did spend the first 18 years of my life in a fish shop in Lancashire in the UK.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
20,"Nicosia has many good fish restaurants were you can try fresh seafood, so I am wondering how can all these people eat the food made from frozen foodstuff. Only if you are very hungry:)",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,We visit this place at least once a month and we always order the platters. Well cooked variety of fish and mussles and prawns and lovely wine. The waiters are very helpful with helping you pick the best wine. Good for a casual night out in the town.,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"This is one of my favourite restaurants. Be it casual or romantic night out, the seafood and sushi is simply delicious. The fish servings are fresh and big, and the seafood platters are from heaven!Reasonably priced and great seating both inside or out!Highly recommended.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"The food may not set the world alight in terms of haute cuisine, but considering you can pay three times as much to eat at another nearby fish restaurant only steps away, Ocean Basket is good value for a reasonable selection of fish, ranging from sushi and sashimi through to greasy spoon type fish and chips (under 10 euro a plate, I forget the exact figure) and some specials.The atmosphere is unpretentious and ideal for families and friends' gatherings, but I wouldn't say it's a place for a date. There is seating outside too, however much of the restaurant is on a busy street.I have been here many times, the last of which was mid-week lunchtime: not busy at all, which is, I suspect, due to a lack of lunchtime special option - surely missing a trick with all the businesses nearby? Sunday lunchtimes are always busy, so do book.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
50,"This by far is one of the best places to eat fish in Nicosia, casual environment and prices, the platter for two is always a good choice or the fish and chips. Service is excellent and the staff is friendly, by far the cheapest place to eat sushi in Nicosia they have realistic prices.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,We liked everything from what it is. This was my second time at this place (in Nicosia) and the best of the two. In my opinion this is not really a restaurant but more like a casual eatery. Food is really good and beats for sure other restaurants of the same concept (casual seafood in low price) in Cyprus. Atmosphere is cool and service quick and friendly. I found the menu a bit limited revolving around the same things for both starters and mains/platters. A must if you are in seafood!,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,The food is always very fresh and tasty and the prices are very reasonable. Sushi is very cheap but there aren't many options to choose from. Tip: Instead of ordering one of the platter options try ordering the dishes one by one. It comes cheaper ;),Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"Ocean Basket serves the best value for money sushi in Nicosia even though the variety is not great. The sushi is fresh and light and you will find yourself gulping piece after piece. It is possible for two adults to get full on sushi at less than 15 EUR each which is remarkable if you consider that some japanese restaurants charge you as if you are dining with Emperor Hirohito himself.The rest of the seafood (prepared mostly from frozen) is average but very affordable which makes it a good choice for groups of people. The wine list is small but they serve some pretty good South African wines at good prices but nothing fancy.Reservations are highly recommended but I wouldn't go on a first date there as it can be too noisy and smell of fried fish inside. The service is friendly but if the restaurant is full it can be tediously slow. On a number of occasions I complained on their tardiness, yet I find myself visiting time after time because it offers great value.I also order take take-away sushi at least twice a month (the girls answering the phone can recognise my voice and know my name and special requests). In fact, typing this just got me hungry and I will order some sushi as soon as I finish this review.Despite its many drawbacks, do not be fooled; Ocean Basket is the best value for money sushi in Nicosia. I keep telling the manager to start delivering and they tell me that this is against their policy. Too bad for all value sushi lovers.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"I was a bIt skeptical about this place but after getting three refrences from friends i trust, we decided to give it a shot. I am rarely pleasantly surprised with restaurants in cyprus but this was indeed a nice surprise. We went for a casual family Saturday lunch with my parents, husband and kids ages 5 and 10 and everyone got a meal they loved- from shrimps to sushi to fried calamari and almost everything in between. The service was very good, the kids got some drawing stuff to keep busy, the staff was polite and even though Greek was not spoken, they were knowledgeable about ingredients and cooking options (i have several dietary restrictions). Everything was fresh, freshly prepared and good quality. I found the california rolls especially good and my kids said their calamari was the best they had in Cyprus (and they are not easy to please with food!) The best part was probably the check- for 4 adults and 2 kids we paid 65 euros (70 with tip) which also included a yummy chocolate cake to share and espresso for me. We did not try the south african wine they serve but now that we know we will be back, we plan to do so next time! I would definitely recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus

10,greasy cheap oily food served fast with poor service,Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
40,"Ok Ocean Basket is a franchise so dont expect the same quality as heavyweights such as Pyxida.It is nevertheless quite good with some of the best fried calamari on the island. Although they tend to abuse the use of their ""sauce"" (the yellow stuff they pour on everything), everything you order is tasty.Prices are quite cheap. You can have a huge platter for 2-3 for 24 EUR (if my memory is correct).Overall, dont expect a 5* dining experience but you will get a better value than most seafood joints (which are not even capable of correctly cooking calamari).",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
30,"The uniqueness of this restaurant must be on its platters, which we have tried none on two visits there. Having tried the shrimps and the fried fish (sole and perch) I cannot say that it was an experience worth repeating. The restaurant's positives are price and service (in that order) but if it is high quality fish you are looking for, based on my experience this is not the place to go.",Ocean Basket Mall of Cyprus
