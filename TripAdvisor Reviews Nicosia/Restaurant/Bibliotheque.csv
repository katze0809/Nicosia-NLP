40,"Was in Nicosia for the Cyprus v Scotland football match, and having a few hours to kill in the city before the match, and trip to the Turkish side of the border was a must to garb a few beers, and in research one place that kept coming up was Bibliotheque.Nice place down a side street on the back of the border wall, done up rather pretty with a hipster vibe to it.Grabbed a table outside (though was VERY busy and only just able to get one, as I had no desire to sit inside) and eventually ordered two beers to just sit back and watch the world go by.Seems to be something of a music venue, as I was shocked with just how big the inside was, when every other bar and restaurant in the area are just tiny bars that you can hardly move about in.Staff are friendly enough, but maybe a little to relaxed, as they seem to go at their own pace, and takes a while to get their attention to order another drink or to ask for the bill.Accepts payment in Turkish Lira,but can pay by card, and prices are not bad.",Bibliotheque
20,"We had dinner at ‚Äùthe Library‚Äù, 2 adults, 2 teenage girls. The only half-decent dish was chicken noodles. The steak was the stringiest I‚Äôve had in ages, the wife‚Äôs chicken was incredibly dry and the Turkish pizza for our daughter was served rather cold. A poor performance by the kitchen. Prices had been updated, don‚Äôt trust the ones on the website. It wasn‚Äôt too expensive, but not particularly cheap either. The decor is nice and quite original though.",Bibliotheque
50,It is quite an experience to walk through the border to discover a myriad of delightful shops before reaching the Bibliotheque restaurant.The restaurant's large courtyard is shaded by dozens of umbrellas hung high above your head and quite innovative. We chose to dine inside the beautifully restored building for a relaxing and most enjoyable lunch.The menu is superb with excellent food in both quality and quantity. The staff are extremely pleasant and efficient and prices entirely reasonable.Highly recommended!,Bibliotheque
40,"It‚Äôs strange having to-take your passport to visit ‚Äò‚Äòthis restaurant, s situated in the Turkish side of Nicosia, so you go out of Greek Cypriot side and into Turkish, and one turn the same passport control. However well worth it to this unique restaurant, outside sitting in the street under umbrellas.... inside. Quite fascinating. Had sounds strange noodles they were great, as was the mea dishes. Definitely if returned to Nicosia would return to this restaurant..",Bibliotheque
40,"Bibliotheque is a quiet respite from the constant buzz around the market area in North Nicosia. It is a beautiful place with good food and good service. We just had salads for lunch, but the menu is large and includes pasta, pizza, burgers, steak, and fish. All the diners sat outside for lunch, but with the shade and fans, it was quite comfortable in the 30+ degree Cyprus heat",Bibliotheque
50,"Nice place down a side street away from the busy and more 'commercial/tourist' restaurants/cafes. The pizzas are brilliant and looking round at other tables, all the food looked good. Very reasonably priced - as everything is in N.Cyprus.",Bibliotheque
50,"Was our first visit. Very good experience. Great place, nice and interesting view. The food quality was above expectations and the prices were great. Staff was mostly helpful.",Bibliotheque
50,Fair good class food clean good service very friendly really welcoming ncie drinks and lovely class food boi,Bibliotheque
50,One of the greatest staff here in Cyprus. They have a great customer service. The mixed kebab is really good and the prices are nicer than most of the locals in Nicosia. Go there if you can,Bibliotheque
30,"The Bibliotheque is located close to the Checkpoint crossing at Ledra Street, B√ºy√ºk Han, Selimiye Mosque and old market, easily to recognize by the several dozen umbrellas hanging decorative above the alley. The building inside is very spacious and can be accessed from both sides.It features a bar, modern industrial style interior, some quiet corners and many outdoor seatings.The location is set for a great experience and can be booked for parties, weddings, coorporate events, unfortunatly both drinks and food lack inspiration. Even though the menu is quite extensive and offers vegetarian options, the food served was not a culinary epiphany but rather average.The staff didn't seem too attentive although there weren't too many customers.And how do you manage to run out of regular Coke?",Bibliotheque
30,Bibliotheque is a nicely located street restaurant in the North side of Nicosia. Standard fare at cheap prices with adequate service. Plenty of inside and outside seating.,Bibliotheque
50,We love the Biblioteque and to be honest it's one of only a handful of decent eateries in the Northern half of Nicosia.,Bibliotheque
50,We had the opportunity to find Biblioth√®que in the small streets of Nicosia and I totally recommend it... atmosphere is cozy... staff is friendly and the food is tasty... u should definitely try this place... the decor is also awesome (have a look inside),Bibliotheque
50,Take in the Turkish side of ledra and enjoy the picturesque inside and outside of this place you won‚Äôt regret it! Great photo opportunity and good place to cool down or relax the food is good drinks better!,Bibliotheque
50,"Good food in a beautiful set up , in the old Nicosia town , with an outside sitting area . Good service!",Bibliotheque
50,"Every time we cross over the border to visit the occupied area of Nicosia we head straight to Biblotheque for a meal. This is one of the best restaurants in the area. The menu has a wide selection of dishes of different nationalities. the surroundings are excellent inside and out. The staff are very friendly and make you feel welcome.on this occasion I had the Rib-eye steak which was cooked to perfection.The prices are second to none, my steak was 10 euros.Anyone finding themselves in the Ledra Street area should make the effort to visit, they won't be disappointed.",Bibliotheque
50,"Good food, friendly staff, beautiful environment. Why are there so few guests in a so nice restaurant? Because it‚Äôs a Friday night in December? The restaurants in North Nicosia are generally cheaper than those in South Nicosia, and the food is as good if not better.",Bibliotheque
40,"We liked the place. Delicious food, nice interior and great staff. üòâüëçüèº but big problem with cats. A lot of them around when you eating üòÑüòÑ",Bibliotheque
40,Nice ambience in the central North Nicosia. Cheap prices fast service. A very interesting big inside seating that hosts live events. European menu but also Turkish Cypriot dishes.,Bibliotheque
50,"Crossed over the border and found this beautiful spot nestled away in one of the streets. Fabulous service from the 2 guys on duty, very attentive and helpful.....and wow, what a building. Be sure to visit and take a look around.",Bibliotheque
40,"Sat outside but interesting building when you go inside. Was there with my daughter and 2 small granddaughters. Staff very helpful and brought extra plates for the girls. Had the sample sharing platter for two, interesting selection of typical Turkish dishes.",Bibliotheque
50,"I had a great lunch at Biblioteque - very good quality food, nice service and really good value for money. I find food in North part of Cyprus much better than in the south and Bibliotheque was one of the best places I have eaten.",Bibliotheque
30,"We stopped in for a drink and sat in their outside area. Nicely decorated and an oasis on a hot day. Just had drinks and perused the menu. Menu was definitely meant for tourist. Don‚Äôt think i would eat there, i would have given it a much better review but I am pretty sure I was short changed. If i was then a 1 star would be appropriate, if I wasn‚Äôt then i would have given it 4 stars based on the atmosphere.",Bibliotheque
40,We visited here again for a lovely meal and drinks as a respite from the hot sun in Nicosia. Lovely fresh bread with hellim and salad with just a few delicious chips washed down with an ice cold beer definitely hit the spot on such a hot day. if you go and get a chance to go inside there is a glass floor that shows the foundations of this beautiful old building. Well worth a visit.,Bibliotheque
50,"We only stopped for drinks, this place is absolute beautiful, the decor is awesome. Nice place to stop.",Bibliotheque
50,Not so friendly staff... but the amazing decor and drinks as well as AC helped the food was good too! If you don‚Äôt eat definitely worth sitting down and having a drink u see umbrellas,Bibliotheque
40,"Stopped here for lunch to cool down in the shade on a hot day.Really interesting set up, gorgeous interior and cute outside area covered with umbrellas.Really large menu, almost too much to choose from.Had a salad which was all I needed on a hot day.Staff were lovely, prices were excellent.If you sit outside expect to be bothered but the stray cats and kittens!!",Bibliotheque
50,"We eat lunch at this restaurant every year and have never been disappointed. This time I had grilled Sea Bream which was great with broiled vegetables. Service always super friendly and efficient. With the Turkish Lira in the doldrums this place is truly value for money - 9 of us for nibbles, lunch, drinks and tip was about ‚Ç¨70. Best restaurant over the Green Line without a doubt.",Bibliotheque
50,At this restaurant you can have great food and great coffee. I was mind blowed about their deserts. A lot of friendly pets (cats). Enjoy :).,Bibliotheque
50,"While shopping on the Turkish side of Nicosia, I was thirsty, tired and beat by all the shopping , walking and browsing all the wares on the shirt laden streets. I was searching like Dorthy for my Oz of drink and nourishment. In the distance I saw twin spires of a mosque hoping that I might find relief when suddenly I saw an Oasis of brightly colored umbrellas dancing in the blue hot sun. There was parisoled tables and huge out door air conditioners. I smelled aromas of grilled meat and witnessed intoxicating, cold, enticicing beverages. The panacea was Bibliotheque. I had entered the Turkish Oz and with my wife on two other occasions sought the refuge of it's iniquities of good food and drink while thinking that Mary Poppins and the scarecrow was lurking near.",Bibliotheque
50,Today we visitid to Nicosia and we went through to the turkish side. We found this little hidden treasure place. There was a lot of colorful umbrella. It had a really good feeling. We ordered some coffe and enjoyed the feeling of this place. After that we smelled a lot of delicous food. Didnt took too much time we ordered some meal and some dessert. Everyting was really delicous the service was professional and the waiters really kind. I can truely recommend for everyone who wants to eat some really good food .,Bibliotheque
50,"Escape place on Turkish side. Interesting design and so many different design corners. Nice place to see what there was and how is now.Yes, a bit overpriced for their famous umbrella alley, but it should be so! It bring me there and I enjoyed!Service very friendly and fast as possible in rush hours!Middle food some 5-7 years, quite ok.",Bibliotheque
40,"This is quite a cool modern club type bar in the old walled city in Lefkosa (Nicosia). Good food at reasonable prices, seating either inside the large bar itself which has a range of different seating areas including some quieter nooks and crannies if you want.As it was a nice day we had our lunch outside. Average prices for Northern Cyprus and very close to one of the pedestrian crossing points, so accessible from Southern Cyprus if you have an EU Passport. Staff were friendly and reasonably attentive.",Bibliotheque
30,We waited for 45 minuets to get two simple sandwiches here and although the surroundings are lovely the food is ok but the service is dreadful. Cheap enough but not enough to make me rush back.,Bibliotheque
40,"Lovely place for a quick break. Menu is good that caters for all taste buds and from what we had, the dishes come with a touristy twist. Staff were very friendly",Bibliotheque
40,"Really nice place well impressed with the interior of the restaurant, food good and very competitively priced. Friendly service and efficient",Bibliotheque
40,"We came upon the restaurant by luck. It's on the occupied north side of The Town. The building is a recently refurbished warehouse type building that cleverly blends old and new, a stone built building with modern steel work on the inside blended with stylish furnishings. Interesting and a bit different. A good choice of food and drink and very good value. Pleasant and attentive staff. We shared a light lunch platter and our friends shared a delicious pizza. Venue accepts euros and Turkish lira.",Bibliotheque
50,"I came here with my wife last night. The decoration in the restaurant is ancient and beautiful. Very nice staff. Food was perfect, really enjoyed the dinner there. Prices were relatively really cheap. By far one of the best restaurants around.",Bibliotheque
50,"Attended this restaurant with my wife, we ordered a mixed grill and traditional cyprus starter for two, food was presented well, tasty, filling and delicious, there is more food variety here, not your local kebab house, much better we thought, the venue is querky unusual and full of history with a modern twist, if you come to Nicosia, this is one restaurant you should visit for the food and experience!! Great customer service and good value for money, not too expensive in our opinion.... will visit every time we are in northern Cyprus!!",Bibliotheque
50,"It is very beautiful restaurant and cafeteria, in place where is shows the old history of the Turkish Cyprus side. delicious food.",Bibliotheque
50,"This proved to be a real, if accidental, find. Fabulous building with a great atmosphere. Varied and comprehensive menu. We were a large group and everyone loved their choice, so that's a favourable sampling of what is on offer. Service was excellent. Prices on menu are in Turkish lira (although not indicated as such, so a little confusing at first). However, they seem to accept a wide variety of currencies so paying in Euros was no problem at all. Overall ,terrific value, and a very memorable occasion. Strongly recommended.",Bibliotheque
50,"This converted library is fascinating as a building and worth a look inside. And, if you choose to eat here too, you will not be disappointed. Large helpings of Turkish food - superb mixed kebab - and good local beer at reasonable prices. Even the toilets are interesting!",Bibliotheque
40,We were looking for somewhere to have lunch and sit outside as the weather was good but we would have missed seeing the inside of this fantastic place if we had. The decor was very modern and not at all what we expected judging from the older buildings around. The food was very good and the service was excellent and the waiters were very friendly. Excellent value for money.,Bibliotheque
40,A fascinating restaurant which was formerly a library. The food was very good and drinks inexpensive.,Bibliotheque
50,We found Bibliotheque on our last day in Nicosia/Lefkosa. We had a couple of cappuccinos outside under the umbrellas. The building has been extensively and quite tastefully renovated. There are multiple sitting areas and levels and the venue can acclimate up to 600 people. There are also live music events. Our disappointment was that we could not properly enjoy a meal here. Next time ...,Bibliotheque
30,"In the centre of historic North Nicosia a few hundred yards from the green line. The interior is very expensively and stylishly renovated, but has more in common with a Manhattan loft than Cyprus, you really could be almost anywhere in the world! Excellent toilets though.A good range of both food and drink are available, but rather expensive, so we chose to have just a drink, and eat more authentically and cheaply nearby. Service was okay, the staff seemed more interested in serving diners.Bibliotheque seened popular with tour guides with Western European/American tastes, all in all a triumph of style over substance for me.",Bibliotheque
50,Wow! Lovely place! Huge selection on menu and very generous portions for very reasonable prices. Cocktails very good value too. We had a party of 30 and everyone really enjoyed their food and they served us all extremely well. I live in Northern Cyprus and this was the nicest restaurant I have been to. Well done to the staff and chefs! Waiter was especially helpful tonight.,Bibliotheque
50,this restored restaurant is a must. the rooms are fascinating and the outside dining area under multi coloured umbrellas is wonderful. well worth a visit.,Bibliotheque
50,This wonderful restaurant provides a tranquil setting after a morning sightseeing. There are different secluded areas to this restaurant as well as outdoor seating. We sat indoors as it was hot and enjoyed a snack and wonderful Turkish coffee.,Bibliotheque
50,We absolutely loved this restaurant. It is most unusual brightly decorated with colorful umbrellas. So inspiring! Excellent service and delicious food. One of the best restaurants I've ever been to.,Bibliotheque
50,"Accidentally came across this restaurant for lunch . Beautiful surrounding , great food and great value for money . Highly recommend . In the Turkish part of Nicosia. ( ps menu in Turkish lira but can pay in euros )",Bibliotheque
50,Very nice atmosphere and food. Had a very nice salad and Turkish pizza. Beautiful surroundings both inside and outside.,Bibliotheque
50,"This old library building has been renovated with great taste and at much expense.The street outside has a mock roof made from coloured umbrellas to give an inside covered effect to being outside.Staff are willing and very able, the customers just keep ordering and the waiters just keep bringing food out.Varied menu, reasonable prices and very good quality.Star of the show was Marsalar who recognised us from last time.4 large beers and a decent pizza / large chicken wrap with chips and salad meant lunch came in at 16 quid. - beat that !",Bibliotheque
50,"Always stop by here for lunch when we‚Äôre in Nicosia. Friendly staff and great European type food, but also some Cyprus specialities, so everyone is happy. It‚Äôs a lovely place to sit under the colourful umbrellas. The salads are really good, and so are the pastas if you‚Äôre hungry. Would recommend.",Bibliotheque
50,"You have to come here if you are in the area. If you are looking for a nice clean and friendly place to eat then you have to visit the Bibliotheque. The food is amazing all seven of us had some fantastic dishes and beer.We opted for the mixed starter for four and a pastry starter for four. Quality!The mixed kebab is great I can't recommend it enough.Will be going again.Clean, cheap, friendly, amazing food in a nice atmosphere.You must.",Bibliotheque
50,Love this restaurant! The building is just amazing and the outdoor tables are pleasant to be there. The food is also great!!!,Bibliotheque
30,"This hotel was recommended but I don't know why. It is situated in downtown Nicosia but it can be easily missed, we only found it by looking up at the skyline and spotting the illuminated sign. When we went there were only 6 other people there and given that there are 2 large eating areas, 1 inside and 1 outside then this wasn't a good sign. The menu is quite varied but the food is just average. The service on what was a quiet night was slow but the staff were very pleasant. As what is normal here, there were also plenty of nuisance cats around. We asked why is was so quiet and were told it was because we were in the tourist area ( don't know where they were then ) and the area the locals used was in the Derryboya area, we checked this out and found this to be correct it was absolutely bustling. It is a shame that this restaurant turned out to be a disappointment because with the profusion of suspended umbrellas and the lovely features of what was once a public library it could be tourist trap.",Bibliotheque
50,"I have to always visit this restaurant, when I am in turkish part od Nicosia. I love them selection of traditional food. And waiter Habibi is so kind and friendlyüëç",Bibliotheque
40,"We were just walking past having crossed over the border and were drawn in by the lovely 'roof' over the outdoor area made up by linking lots of normal sized, brightly coloured umbrellas.We just stopped for a drink on a hot day. I had a fresh lemonade which I enjoyed. Service was very good. People were starting to arrive for lunch. There were also some large fans blowing air which helped keep us cool.",Bibliotheque
40,"In the middle of the hustle and bustle of the tourist streets of Nicosia the Bibliotheque restaurant is a cool peaceful haven for a drink or a meal, sitting under a colourful screen of umbrellas. We had a light lunch here served by friendly staff and with prices at a very reasonable level, I would recommend anyone to pay this place a visit.",Bibliotheque
40,Wandering around North Nicosia sightseeing stumbled on this place for lunch. Only wanting a light snack opted for sharing platter of traditional Turkish dishes. Had a great lunch with beers and water all for under ‚Ç¨16,Bibliotheque
40,"Turning a corner in the maze of streets near the Caravansary in Nicosia, one is bedazzled with the sight of this cafe with its irresistible ""roof"" of colorful umbrellas. In a recently restored old library, the Bibliotheque restaurant/cafe/bar serves good and moderately-priced food and drink both inside the gracious old building and outside underneath the umbrella rainbow. Most (like me), I expect, will be unable to resist the fantastical ambiance under the umbrellas. The kebabs are excellent and huge, and is was lots of choice from a menu of typical Cypriot/Turkish offerings. The prices are in Turkish lira, so remember that when a plate of kebabs is listed at 26 lira, that's really only 6.5 euros, as the ratio is 4 lira to 1 euro.The service is slow, but what do you care, when you're sitting in a magical place?!",Bibliotheque
10,"My family and I visited this restaurant following an enjoyable day in Nicosia. We were impressed by the friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere and were surprised by the very cheap prices, having become accustomed to more expensive meals across the border. The food was tasty enough, although not befitting of a return visit if truth be told. It wasn't until the following day, when all of those in our party who had eaten a chicken based meal, encountered food poisoning. This really took the shine off of our holiday and left my four year old niece and husband particularly poorly. My advice is to be careful when ordering chicken from this establishment as I'd hate for somebody else to encounter a similar fate to my family members.",Bibliotheque
40,"Only called in for a cool drink. Sat outside under an array of umbrellas. When visiting the gents inside waled over a glass floor which has a re - enactment of family life in days gone by, all subtly done with lighting. As the name suggests there is a reading area with some very ornate chairs. An assortment of photographs on the wall shows the renovations that were taken to bring this place to its present standing. Sadly I didn't use the restaurant but was impressed with what I saw on other customers plates.",Bibliotheque
50,"Nice set, very airy and colourful terace, friendly staff and definatelly the best place to eat the best kebab ever. If you are a cats person you will enjoy it even more since there were more than 6 kities coming to our table. The prices are amazing. This restaurant provides gourmet food for fast food prices. We has 2 mixed kebabs and 4 efes for as little as 25 EUR.",Bibliotheque
50,"Nice place, nice people, nice food. The prices are in Turkish lira but they recive all kind of curenncy.",Bibliotheque
30,"Such a beautiful building but the food lets it down. First time we went, we ordered a platter for two. It was fine. The next time we went with 3 people we ordered a platter for 3 and it was exactly the same size as a two person one. Basically as the weather gets warmer they start to mess about with portions thinking tourists wont notice. We live in Cyprus so are wise to this. This place is busy because it looks nice. Plenty are better places to eat in Cyprus",Bibliotheque
40,"There aren't many dining options in North Nicosia's old city, but this is worth visiting just for its unique fit out. The outside courtyard is lined by plants and full of well-looked after street cats, under an awning of multi-coloured umbrellas (reminiscent of the Dubai Mall), and the classy interior is arched stone columns, wooden beams and an eclectic mix of chairs. A great feature is a glass floor section looking down to a 'room' below of 'people' looking back up at you. There is a very large selection of international food and some local dishes - the shared platters of local pastries are worth a try. Service was attentive.",Bibliotheque
50,"After galloping around the central part of Nicosia on our RSD Travel ""Cultural Tour"", we were released by our guide, Sinan, to explore the area around the Caravanserai. After spending a little time walking through the indoor market, and visiting the Mosque, we had to return to this restaurant to pay an additional several hundreds of pounds to enjoy what RSD call the basic package ""Gourmet"", allowing us to access a buffet for our evening meal in our hotel, and the ""Explorer"" package of additional excursions, which turned out to be pretty poor value. However, the Bibliotheque was an absolute delight. Situated in one of the ubiquitous alleyways leading to the infamous ""Green Line"", set up to separate the warring Turkish and Greek Cypriots in 1974, and still patrolled to this day over 50 years later by the UN, we were offered a table under the shade of an umbrella. Seated in the ominous shadow of rusted barbed wire and ill-made walls thrown up in great haste to divide the two Cypriot communities, we looked around the other occupied tables, trying to decide something for lunch. Next to us, two ladies were tucking into the restaurant's signature burgers so we plumped for the same, and boy were they the business. Accompanied by a fresh and exotic salad, and washed down by a very good Northern Cypriot white wine, we were astonished to receive a bill for 65 Turkish Lire, about ¬£14.50 or US $ 20, such a small price to pay. We were entertained by the sight of some beautiful models, who we learned are aspiring actresses, being photographed in the magnificent library inside part of the sprawling restaurant, and the building and venue are also favourite with wedding parties. Incidentally, it is no big deal to cross over the border, where you quickly realise the benefits that the Republic of Cyprus enjoy as part of the European Union.",Bibliotheque
50,"very central, colourful, very friendly staff. I thought it was delicious and cheap and a pleasant place to sit",Bibliotheque
50,Located in a small side street it is very noticeable from all the coloured umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. It is just off the main walk through and is quiet. The food was very good and well priced. Make sure you go inside to see the large glass floor with the exposed Cellar. Well worth a stop for either a drink or food.,Bibliotheque
50,Sit outside under the boulevard of multi coloured umbrellas and pick anything off the menu. Then be amazed as the prices are in Turkish Lira and have a brilliantly cheap meal.,Bibliotheque
40,"Stumbled upon this place via the back door after having been to look at the Mosque. The wooden doors are impressive enough to make you stop and look in, and initially it's deceptive as to how vast the place is.From the front, you'll notice an alleyway with coloured umbrellas hanging overhead.Inside, the restaurant seems to comprise several 'areas', each very individually decorated. Look out for the glass floor near the toilets.I only stopped for a drink, so cannot comment on the food. Staff were very pleasant and polite.",Bibliotheque
50,"Had lunch here when we visited Nicosia with our tour group,we chose the steak sandwiches with potato wedges,with onions and mushrooms,absolutely gorgeous,we ate outside as it was good weather,overhead were lots of coloured umbrellas so unusually.Staff were good,prices were reasonable too.",Bibliotheque
40,"Stopped at this restaurant on a trip with the family, it is in the centre of the Turkish side of Nicosia down a pretty cool looking street. 4 of us ordered food and drink from the classics Turkish style Kebab menu. The food was very nice and there was lots of it, coming in at only ‚Ç¨25 including drinks for all 4 so we was very happy with the value for money. The staff was also very perlite and helpful. I would definitely return if I'm there again.",Bibliotheque
40,"We had prearranged to meet some friends at the Bibliotheque restaurant, and because we had already eaten elsewhere we only took light refreshments, so whilst I cannot honestly comment about the quality of the food what we did see other customers eating looked quite appetizing.In addition to the main restaurant there are on-street tables as well, the street is not a throughfare for traffic, so no issues with traffic fumes whilst dining.Food aside, seeing the interior of the Bibliotheque was a worthwile experience in itself, and most importantly, the toilets were very clean (and free).",Bibliotheque
10,The place is looks really nice but the food is so terrible I couldn't even eat. I ordered noodles and it was too much salty. Also burger was terrible. Meat was in bad quality. I checked first TripAdvisor but it is definitely overrated.,Bibliotheque
50,"Really loved this place, all tables outside covered by about 50 open umbrellas balance on wires overhead so protective from too much sun and maybe rain? Busy busy busy on a weekday in February, very popular to sit outside. Food very nice, service slow du to so much activity and trying for quick turnover for waiting groups. Beautiful building inside, huge bar, go look at floor before going upstairs, there's a family tableau of mannequins under glass, too funny. Nice place for lunch",Bibliotheque
20,"Recommended by our hotel, we decided to lunch at Bibliotheque - a beautiful renovated contemporary eating space a stones throw from the market. Excited! we ordered an Adana kebab and a chicken kebab - mains served with chips, a touch of salad and burgul.As almost experts about Adana kebabs, having eaten them all over Turkey and in so many restaurants... what was served on the plate was a refried Adina - very oily and stale :-(The server asked the usual ""how was your meal"" and there was no reaction when I told him how disappointing the food was.I recommend eating at any of the other kebab houses right next door to Bibliotheque, where one could smell and see the kebabs grilling.",Bibliotheque
40,"I loved the outside with the roof of coloured umbrellas. Inside was also good and clean. The food was tasty, the service prompt and the price reasonable. What else do you want ?",Bibliotheque
40,"Just stopped by to see inside and were very impressed with the standard of decor, finished to a high standard and fun seeing the cellar area through the glass floor - pretty outside with the coloured umbrellas above the tables",Bibliotheque
50,Bibliotheque stands out in the Northen part of Nicosia! The Turkish-Cypriot part close to the green line and Ledra Street Crossing is very old and scruffy. Bibliotheque Restaurant on the other hand is totally refurbished. The restaurant is beautifully and stylisly decorated. The shaded aera outside is decorated by umbrellas. We have been there several times during sightseeing to enjoy something to drink and enjoy the interior decoration.,Bibliotheque
30,"Went for lunch. We had different Turkish kebabs which were fantastically prepared, fresh and tasted very good and were authentic. What let the lunch down was the service. The coffees we ordered were cold and our food was luke warm. We ate outside which meant there were double digit cats to keep us company. I would go again for sure and do recommend their food.",Bibliotheque
50,"I had a great experience in this place! Its stylish, the service is good, friendly and helpful staff and the food is fantastic. Also the prices are great for the big portions and variety. Definitely recommend!",Bibliotheque
40,"Ate lunch here on our first adventure across the border, attracted by the pretty umbrella canopy which we and our 3 year old loved!Plenty of choice on the menu for meat eaters and vegetarians. Kids menu has 4 options that would suit most. Some great traditional dishes. Staff appropriately friendly and efficient, helped with good advice on drinks choice.Loved the interior decor of the main building, will definitely venture here again through the winter.Option to pay in TL or ‚Ç¨. It was ‚Ç¨25 for 2 adults and 1 child, including drinks, so great value when the portions were all sufficiently filling.",Bibliotheque
50,"Stopped here for a coffee whilst in Nicosia, service was very prompt and the coffee good. The whole of the outside part of the restaurant was covered in umberellas looked fantastic.One of our party had a birthday on that day and they brought a cake out and sang Happy Birthday, a very nice touch.Well worth visiting.",Bibliotheque
40,"We really enjoyed the umbrellas which gave a great ligthing, inside the setting is superbe as well. The service didn't speak english, communication was difficult. The food was very cheap nothing over 15‚Ç¨, but not everybody at our table enjoyed all of it (fish).",Bibliotheque
50,"the umbrella canopy is beautiful, I could have stayed there all day! The menu is in Turkish but the waiters are happy to translate. The meze platters are great value for money and I was so excited to have a pint of Efes (lovely turkish larger!). Would have stayed for lunch AND dinner if I had my way!",Bibliotheque
40,"Had a walk round Nicosia today and ventured into the North side the food here is nice but the drink is very cheap and it's a nice calm chilled atmosphere the building is kept to a high standard and the tables outside can hold a lot of people I would recommend this place to anyone really friendly staff and top food , Thanks",Bibliotheque
50,"We sat outside under a remarkable high canopy of multicolored umbrellas which protected diners from Cyprus's still hot early fall temperature. This restaurant is very large and although nobody was dining inside, there was reason to take a tour of the glass floors to the left of the inside to see the marvelous dioramas likely preserved from the days this building served as a library. Though Bibliotheque was quite busy that lunch day, the service was friendly, prompt and efficient. We ordered a mesa that my wife and I split and I ordered a soup that is regularly on the menu. I did not write down the name in Turkish, but when I asked about the soup, the waiter described it as being made with nuts and cream so I took a chance. While all the food was of high quality and great taste, I must say that the soup was the best soup I have had anywhere and was the highlight of the meal! My wife tasted the soup and agreed that it as heavenly. I have looked for that soup in other restaurants in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus to no avail. I am beginning to check on-line and in Turkish cookbooks. So, I urge anyone going to this restaurant to be sure to get the special creamy nut soup with pistachios, some sort of fruit and a magical, unforgettable taste.",Bibliotheque
50,Five minutes stroll into the Turkish side of the city and we found this absolute gem of a place.The setting is excellent and the interior of the building is unexpected and really impressive.We selected two dishes which provided us with a variety of local delicacies all of which were of excellent quality. At ‚Ç¨19 for the dishes and two drinks it was tremendous value.If we had been able to do so we would certainly have returned before the end of our holiday.,Bibliotheque
50,"Despite being in the centre of the old town, a tourist destination, the food and drinks are very well priced and the quality could not be faulted. Their unique ""roof"" of umbrellas make for an unforgettable visit. DO not forget to go inside and see the floor......",Bibliotheque
50,"On a boiling day in July we stopped for drinks & lunch. Great food, service was good & free wi-fi. Prices were very reasonable. The interior is brilliant. Massive ac units positioned outside which were bliss! Too many cats & kittens loitering though.",Bibliotheque
40,"We found this place purely by chance as we walked through the narrow, hot and bustling streets - the umbrellas caught our attention. Quite a tranquil spot, the outdoor tables had AC ( very welcome in 37 degrees!) and the food was fresh. It is a lovely place to sit and take some time out from the heat and crowds. Surprised it was not busier but then it is easy to miss as it is off the main street.",Bibliotheque
40,"We stuck to the traditional dishes and were not disappointed. Restaurant class with taverna tastiness. We sat outside to catch sun & cool air but would love to sample the funky interior at night, it looks fabulous. This is an unpretentious gem that should get UN members fighting for a posting to the divided city.",Bibliotheque
30,"We popped in for lunch mid week. It was far from busy but it was extremely hot. We decided inside with air con was what we needed. Sadly the air con wasn't working but the staff brought us or own unit from outside & sat us right next to it. That was great service. Sadly that was the last we had. We ordered burgers without sauce. They came, eventually, with sauce. I ate mine but we sent my daughters back. Admittedly everything is cooked fresh so we're happy to wait for that but it did seem a long wait nonetheless. On arriving the first thing was to order drinks, we were gasping! The beer arrived almost straight away. The 3 cokes took 20 minutes. We had to chase. I'm still unsure why they weren't brought together. Even waiting for the bill & to pay took a long time. A shame considering there are more staff than customers.",Bibliotheque
50,"Stopped here for a drink early one morning when visiting Nicosia . Absolutely amazing place , would love to of spent more time here . Definitely worth visiting. Very unique.",Bibliotheque
40,Lovely to find this on a scorching hot day one lunchtime the staff were friendly and took effort in making sure that we sat near a cooler fan much appreciated in a hot day,Bibliotheque
50,"Staff, service and food brilliant. 4 of us had a very fulfilling lunch with drinks of excellent quality for under ‚Ç¨40. If you are nearby it is a must. We will return for sure.",Bibliotheque
40,What a delight to find this brilliantly restored building in the center of Nicosia. It has been converted very gracefully into a restaurant. The aisle of coloured umbrellas was what attracted us first. We only had drinks but the food looked and smelt amazing and the price was very good. Will stay for food next year but the visit was still very worthwhile.,Bibliotheque
50,"The gorgeously renovated restaurant/cafe/bar (2014) is in a building that once housed a shoe factory, near the market and the Selimiye Mosque in old Nicosia, north.For lunch, the grilled hellim/halloumi salad was delicious, the bulgar koftesi was very tasty, and the rest of the menu looked great.The place has a nice ambience, an open, modern, elegant look and feel. There are good views of the mosque and from the second floor terrace.The patio area is creatively covered by scores of brightly colored umbrellas, secured by an ingenious method of wires and fasteners.The servers were professional and friendly, and rightly proud of their unique restaurant and its delicious food.Particularly attractive: it's blessedly air conditioned - thank goodness, because it's 111F/44C outside right now.",Bibliotheque
40,"Ate lunch here whilst visiting Nicosia with friends and were really impressed with this restaurant. The brightly coloured umbrellas providing shade outside, coupled with an air conditioning unit near us made for a very pleasant couple of hours. Staff very friendly and prices really good. Will definitely be returning",Bibliotheque
40,"We visited Bibliotheque for the first time last October. We were disappointed by the service. It was much improved this time. The setting is delightful. However, the shade provided by the attractive but insubstantial parasols is inadequate for the noonday heat of June and I think the restaurant needs to make it a little more comfortable. The food was simple but good and we didn't have to wait too long. We had fajitas which were tasty and good value for money. Perhaps we should have gone inside to avoid the midday sun",Bibliotheque
50,"We stumbled across this lovely trendy bar / cafe near the Selimiye mosque are alongside the border. There is a small alley where shade is provided by a large number of coloured umbrellas under which are tables.Really lovely staff- very friendly even trying to get my Wife to try a Turkish coffee ( I gave had no luck with anything vaguely like espresso in 30+ years), The inside has been very tastefully redecorated to a very high standard with a small exhibition around how this was restored. There is a glass floor under which is a reconstruction of past times. Spotless western toilets.Ramadan less strictly observed in Northern Cyprus than in other Muslim majority countries and I felt a lot happier enjoying my fare with a local family on the next door table similarly partaking.A great cafe find and very reasonable prices as well.",Bibliotheque
50,"We dined here for both lunch and dinner during our recent holiday. Firstly we loved the sun canopy made up of individual umbrellas that provided the shade over the outdoor dining area. The food was excellent on each of our visits as well as the service.Inside the restaurant is lovely and airy as it is set over several floors, with a small roof terrace.",Bibliotheque
50,A beautiful place in the old city of Lefkosia in the Turkish part. The food was excellent and the restaurant is definitely a must see. I love their cheese stuffed Kofte meatballs. I can definitely recommend this restaurant.,Bibliotheque
50,One of the most amazing restaurants I've been too. Excellent location and settings. the food is just incredible!,Bibliotheque
50,"This is the old library within the old town, renovated to a very high level, at home in Manchester or Leeds perhaps ! Lovely interior and decorService can be hit and miss, so make sure you make friends with ""gun"" she is the organised one with the dark hair, who takes no crap off bossy customers (not me)Lots of tapas to chose from, she even remembered that we had a large beer each last time ! Two beers then ...Mix of small starters got us in the mood,Chicken wrap was toasted and very tasty, many lovely med salads delight every time.Ideal for a good lunch, especially if you fancy an outside-in experience, see pic",Bibliotheque
50,"In the heart of the walled city - the Turkish side. This restaurant was rebuilt and furnished to a fantastic standard. Eating outside in the late April sun was excellent. To provide shade along the restaurant's ""boulevard"" different coloured umbrellas form a canopy - very effective and very unusual. The inside very well designed as were the toilets!",Bibliotheque
40,"It was the first time I've been here. It is not a very special one, but not bad. It is good option here in Lefkosa. We liked all the food and drink we had. The place, itself, is nice as well.",Bibliotheque
10,"very good location but very bad food, very bad service very expensive. Very slow service, staff is not friendly at all! Pizza is a piece of tortilla with cheese on top yet its price is high and the biftek sandwich was tasteless!",Bibliotheque
10,"Saturday lunchtime and things were buzzing. A lot of shoppers around and the restaurants were busy except for one, bibliotheque. My wife and I settled down and waited to get the menu. Waiters were very busy doing nothing but they were expert in failing to meet my eye. I checked that I had not put on my invisibility cloak, but no, my wife confirmed I was there. After fifteen minutes of no menu we walked out and found somewhere else. These guys have spent a lot of money making a nice place. They need to get their act together.",Bibliotheque
30,"Called in about 1730hrs on a Monday, group of 12. No others in the place. Quite a few of the menu items not available, 3 chicken burgers arrived as beef burgers, had to wait 20 minutes for this to be rectified! one fillet steak arrived 10 minutes after everybody else had finished eating. The waiter knocked over one burger and man handled it back together at the table, needless to say it wasn't eaten! Food tasted ok, chef needs sorting out, waiter sort of did his best. God knows what it would be like on a busy day or night. Rubbish really.",Bibliotheque
50,"The brightly colored umbrellas hanging above the restaurant entrance catch everyone's attention. The food is delicious, and the inside of the restaurant is gorgeous and spacious. True to its name, it even has a small library inside. You can even go up to the roof and get a view of the surrounding area. If you choose to eat outside, know that you will be joined by some hungry kitties! Overall great experience.",Bibliotheque
40,"The place in itself is worth the visit. Elegant wooden structures, astonishing sky of colorful umbrellas, and very good prices. Close to the Greek border of Nicosia, a pleasant discovery on the Turkish-controlled side.",Bibliotheque
50,I have been in this restaurant many times and I'm always looking forward to go back. During the day it's nice to sit outside under about 190 umbrellas to enjoy the coffee and snacks. Later in the afternoon it's a nice place to enjoy glass of wine with cheese and fruits.Indoor area is very nice place for a dinner... I like the interior of this place where wood combined with glass and metal give to this place historical yet modern touch. I also had a dinner here and the food was very nice and wine really good.,Bibliotheque
50,"The multicoloured umbrellas suspended over the street are what attracted us initially. The food was very good & plentiful also not expensive, but it was only after venturing inside to find the toilets did we realise what a fascinating & beautiful building it is. We shall certainly return on our next trip to Cyprus",Bibliotheque
40,"We have visited several times this year and never been disappointed by the experience. Service can be a bit slow and follow-up rather random but if you are not in a hurry it's a great place to take a break just a few yards from the busy main thoroughfare. The inside is quite fascinating, creatively renovated over several floors, with great views from the top terrace and quiet 'European' background music. Food is well-priced, nicely presented and very tasty.. 'Wash-room' facilities are excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. On a couple of occasions our drinks orders went astray and there really are not enough staff to deal with the popularity of this unusual venue. We found that 'Geoffrey' - an Architectural graduate from Nigeria - is a good person to chase up orders, also a young lady who previously worked at Buyuk Khan (where the Restaurant has gradually taken over and detracted from the charm of this other renovated venue)",Bibliotheque
30,"This is one of the most stunning and novels eateries ive seen. Although the prices were very good for central district, the food seemed to be pre cooked. Cold coffee and warmish food. Probably ok for coffee though.",Bibliotheque
40,"Crossed from south to north Nicosia and looked at our guide book, Marco Polo Travel Guide, recommended this. Quite a find in what is essentially a very run down city, the Northern part that is. Huge place with outdoor seating and 2 floors inside. Beware, if you in a hurry then go elsewhere. We were seated quickly enough and luckily ordered our drinks straight away which arrived promptly. However there seemed to be only one waiter taking orders although there were many more serving the food and drinks. We had to wait quite a while for our order to be taken and then again for it to be delivered to our table. HOWEVER, we had time, the surroundings are beautiful, quite a renovation project, and the food was worth the wait. I had the meatballs stuffed with cheese served with sauted aubergine, roasted tomatoes and peppers and my wife had the lamb cutlet on aubergine puree with roasted tomato and pepper. Delicious.Free Wi-Fi but they don't give you the key. They will take your phone and input it themselves. Curious!",Bibliotheque
40,"We visit Nicosia every time we come to Northern Cyprus. That's a couple of times a year and we have been coming for about nine years. We have always been disappointed by the dearth of decent restaurants and have usually ended up having lunch in the courtyard of the Han. We were delighted to see the Bibliotheque situated at the centre of the walled city. The setting is splendid and the refurbishment of the buildings an excellent piece of work. It was about twenty to twelve when we arrived and, although it was early, we decided to have lunch. There is a good selection of well- cooked and presented simple foods. Our drinks and meals arrived without delay and the service was friendly. We were able to sit outside under the parasols. However, as time passed by the restaurant became quite crowded and the staff were unable to cope. We had to ask for our bill three times and when it eventually arrived it was almost impossible to pay. A poor ending to what would otherwise have been an excellent lunch in a delightful setting. We will give it another go next year in the hope that they will have sorted out these teething problems by then.",Bibliotheque
50,"Bibliotheque is a really nice restaurant.It's located a bit hidden in an alley but distinctively identifiable cause the colorful roof of umbrellas.The dishes are delicious and you don't have to wait so long. Despite of that everything is fresh.The illustratively designed menu offers fish and meat but also pizza, pasta, salad and some really good vegetarian. Something for everybody.The price is adequate and constitutes about 10-30 turkish Lira.All waiters are attentive, friendly and polite.You can sit inside in a very elegant atmosphere with wonderful old chairs and sofas or at the bar. There is also a small library inside.Or you enjoy the charme outside under 180 umbrellas.This location is recommendable for a date, a family trip, a nice time with friends, a group stopover or even for singles.",Bibliotheque
50,on our excursion to the North of Cyprus we wanted to have lunch In the Turkish part but didn't have a lot of time. We stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant and lunch was a real treat. Very good service and fresh tasty food. Loved the brightly coloured umbrella canopy and the inside of the restaurant was stunning. Highly recommend this unique restaurant.,Bibliotheque
50,Lunch with family (all of whom had been before). Sadly the rooftop terrace was closed. Very accommodating staff with 4 tables rearranged for us. Service friendly and efficient. Food simple but first class.,Bibliotheque
50,Whether you go here just for drinks or a meal you really do need to go inside and see the magnificent job they have made of refurbishing this old building. In my opinion it is quite spectacular . The furnishings are lovely and there are areas where you can have a quiet drink or coffee to the full dining experience. They have a whole list of events over the upcoming Bayram holidays which I will post a photo of. Great service. Everything about this place is wonderful.,Bibliotheque
50,"this place is quite magic: you can find history, excellent food and extroardinary kind people. we ate in the evening of August",Bibliotheque
30,"This restaurant delivers with a fantastic setting, I love stone buildings. The inside is quite astonishing for North Cyprus, I was actually taken aback. However, for what it gives in atmosphere and visual delight, it can't follow through with the food and drinks. The service was a bit slapdash. We were told our drinks were a gift from the manager, but they were on the bill at the end. Lots of vegetarian options actually, and I had mushroom crepe. There were plenty of other options. Bit pricey for lunch time, but it is in a tourist mecca.",Bibliotheque
50,"What an astonishing, refreshing building. We were taken there by friends and I was just simply stunned. It deserves a much higher rating than it has in Tripadviser. It is a wonderful luncheon bolt-hole. In fact in the last month, we have revisited on two further occasions.The building refurbishment was wonderfully carried out. It is both dramatic and very sensitive to the original details‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. the combination of the old and the new is very successful.We have been pleased with the service on each of our visits. The menu is fresh and invigorating, an attempt to be different from the normal run of Turkish restaurants and deserves to be applauded. However, I feel that the menu could be greatly improved. Having said this, overall the experience is very satisfying and is excellent value.The addition of the umbrellas in the alleyway is just so original and adds a splendid colourful feature.",Bibliotheque
40,"The restaurant is a renovated old building in an alley, it is has a canopy for shade made of lots of umbrellas of different colours, it looks fantastic. Food was very good, service attentive. An enjoyable experience all round. Just for the atmosphere it is worth a visit.",Bibliotheque
50,We have visited this area numerous times and went with my son and girlfriend who is a vegan. We liked the look of it as it was tucked up a lovely side street. They were very helpful with a vegan choice and we ask picked different menus ask of which were really nice and we'll presented. We also had fresh lemonade which was do refreshing on a very hot day. Staff Very attentive Although To be fair they were not that busy at the time.,Bibliotheque
30,"Before we visited it, I heard a lot about the place. The decoration and the renovation of the old building was really good. Very nice entrance. It felt great. However the food and the service was so poor. Disappointed with the quality of the food. Needs a lot of improvement. However everyone said the venue is very good for concerts. Bibliotheque has definately got the potential.",Bibliotheque
50,"A new restaurant in the heart of the walled city section of Lefkosa (Nicosia). The reasautrnat opened in September and I had the pleasureto visit with a good friend from Cyprus. The restaurant was build in a section of the old city and retained many of the feature of the orginal design of the building with a inner moder flare and a very open atmphoshere with outdining in the neighboring ally. The food was top quality, we enjoyed the spicy red pepper tomatoe soup, several local appeizers, great wine and nice selection of dessers. Overall a dinner with drink for 6 people was very reasonable about $180 USD. If you find yourself in Lekosa I highly recommend a visit for lunch or dinner and take time to explore the restaurant and all the relaxing seating areas and adjacent rooms. On the night we were there they had live music, a gentle backaground and not too loud to have a conversation. Simply it was a wonderful evening",Bibliotheque
