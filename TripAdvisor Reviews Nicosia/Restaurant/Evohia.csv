30,"I don't know what's so elegant about this place, it has a good interior design but it's a business lunch buffet restaurant primarily and the food is good but not the best",Evohia
40,"Over the years, this place doesn't change. It reaches high standards in its levels of service, choice and quality of food, and reasonable prices. People come back because they know they get what they like and I'm told it's packed on a Sunday. This is a plus but can also be a downside in that there's very little additional variation or imagination. Certainly the buffet is packed with lots of lovely salads and dips and I couldn't stop myself going back for more of those wonderful aubergine slices in batter. But the addition of say some Asian inspired dishes would also go down well, and maybe a bit of Thai or Mexican spice? Because if a place is not moving forward, then it doesn't just stand still, it goes backwards and that would be a shame. The introduction of some new dishes doesn't need to be overdone as clearly the restaurant doesn't want to lose its core Cypriot traditional clientele. It also needs to look at its selection of deserts and puddings - which as others have said are not included in the basic 13.50 euro (eat as much as you want from the buffet) price. I'm a chocoholic - and I found nothing that winked and said choose me from the dessert display. Even though the basic price is low, once you've added a glass of wine plus water and a coffee you're still coming in over 20 euros a head. But its worth it. Maybe heated plates would be a bonus as we found our warm food go cold on the plate almost before we sat down.",Evohia
50,Close to center a very friendly place with a menu you can also to taste various plates in excellent prices.,Evohia
30,the buffet did not have cakes although they are advertised on pics you have to pay extra for the cake,Evohia

It has everything, a big choice of salads, meat, fish, vegitables, rice, potatos pasta, sweets, drinks, coffee. Excellent service, very good prices about 21 ewros per person including wine, beers, refreshments and water, sweets and coffee.

50,"very rich boufet, Everything was really tasty! yesterday i tried the buffet of a nearby hotel (5 star) and i can't compare the 2. Evohia is much better , and at cheaper price I have to tell.",Evohia
50,"Returning to EVOHIA after some time did not present any real surprises....The buffet dinner keeps providing a rich selection of fresh salads while there is a wonderful selection of numerous main courses, including both a variety of meat dishes as well as typical Greek Cypriot alternatives. The atmosphere is quite pleasant, the service very satisfactory and as for the set price, it is perhaps the only ""surprise"", being affordable indeed!",Evohia
40,"Very good quality buffet with a notable variety of dishes, at an impressively decorated place that has a very medieval atmosphere. Very friendly staff and average prices. A rightfully well-established place in Nicosia.",Evohia
40,"Had lunch there on 15/08/18 and the place was crowded to capacity.The food was ,as usual very good both in quality and variety.Good service and good value for money.",Evohia

Good location close to the city center of Nicosia. Parking available. Thank you.Also try Estiades of the same group of restaurants.Thank you very much.,Evohia
50,"I really like the evohia place. The food is very tasty there. It is a buffet so you can eat as much as you want. I would really recommend it to go with lots of friends and family.The inside restaurant is fine, what I didn't like it's the outside section that kinda feels old and the air-fans were broken and I started to sweaty after a while. Next time I will sit inside.",Evohia
50,I was staying at the Hilton on a buisiness trip and dined there 3 times.Large clean facility 3 min from the hotelFor 13 euros you get a buffet with a large varaiety of freash salads and cooked foodDrinks and desserts are extraVery tasty and large varaiety,Evohia
30,"Near Hilton in Nicosia. Old decoration. They have a buffet serving a variety of salads beef chicken etc the food is ok, the service correct. The positive is you can eat quickly and leave mainly if you are in hurry. The buffet is around 12-13 eur per person without drink or desert.",Evohia
50,"Great place, it is a stylish all you can eat place with great food, nice ambient music. Personnel is helpful and polite, definitely worths a visit! The spinach pie and apple&nuts salad were my favorites.",Evohia
50,"Normally I steer clear of buffets but I’m glad I made an exception here - really good range of very fresh food including very tasty meats and luscious salads. We were staying at the Hilton opposite and were in shock at the restaurant prices there - Evohia was a 2 minute walk away and at around 12 euros each it has to be one of the best value options around for fresh, healthy food!",Evohia
40,"This was the last of many visits to this favourite and very popular eatery, where the non smoking law is in full effect. As always it is a buffet restaurant with a very rich and very tasteful choice at a cost of under 15 euros pp excluding drinks. Premium quality food and friendly prices explain why one must reserve a few days ahead in order to find a seating place. Our choice was Blasiades (?) local wine which was excellent. The place is fully recommended and is just in front of the main Hilton.",Evohia
50,Huge variety of food great personel highly recomended great price and very friendly personel and place,Evohia
50,"Best buffet in town , very very good price for a buffet per person, huge variety of foods and also great service and very friendly owners and staff. Must visit",Evohia

40,"Visited for dinner staff were very good , food was excellent but not very warm desserts are extra but worth it a very nice visit for a good price",Evohia
50,So many options and all of them are so good.. the only problem you will face is to decide when to stop eating :) .. really good food and salad options.. the staff is attentive too,Evohia
50,Enjoyed a great meal at this buffet restaurant that had a great variety of different salads and foods for dinner when we stopped by. Surprised that there were so few other diners but the staff kept the food coming and i had absolutely no complaints. They had several different salads and also several different types and meats and hot vegetables. A great place to go if you are really hungry in Nicosia! Highly recommended as both high quality food and a very reasonable price.,Evohia
40,The restaurant has very nice indoor and outdoor atmosphere for summer time The food is nice and suggest this place for companies who need a nice place for lunch or dinner with a good drink. Offer buffet with dessert,Evohia
50,"there is a very good buffet with various food. nice atmosphere.value for money. perfect for couples, friends and families. Opposite of Hilton hotel",Evohia
50,We went during the holidays middle of August in Nicosia where everything is closed. We were the first people there and feared the worst as was completely empty. We were very pleasantly surprised and the quality of the buffet was excellent and varied. Decor is old school and matches that of the Hilton were we stayed!Service was very good and we would return.Also excellently priced at 13 Euros.,Evohia
50,"Good variety with both meat and vegetarian options, very good price. Nice atmosphere, clean and great service.",Evohia
40,"We visited on the last day of our week in Lefkosia. The restaurant was a a 15 minute walk from our apartment on Kennedy avenue. It was quite full when we arrived to a friendly welcome. It is quite spacious and cool on a very hot day. It is a buffet restaurant and you choose from various salads and hot dishes. This was the first time we had fish this week! We chose lovely green,parsley,beans and delicious potato salads plus lamb and pork dishes. You can go up as many times as you like but, for us two visits was fine.We thought that the desserts were included in the price of 12.95 euros but they were not. They cost 2.80 euros each. Of course,drinks are also extra. The staff were efficient and friendly.Altogether an enjoyable experience.",Evohia
50,"I visited this establishment for the first time in 2006 and was very impressed by the quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. I had the opportunity to dine here again on July 7th, 2017 and the food was fresh, yummy, and as diverse as could be on a buffet. Make sure to save your appetite for the dessert bar; I recommend the Lebanese Mahalebi cups. They are to die for!",Evohia
50,"I have visited this restaurant buffet bar before, and it is still a good place to have lunch. The staff were helpful and the buffet wide ranging and good quality. Definitely worth a visit.",Evohia
40,"A classic Cypriot buffet restaurant. Fresh salads and varying dishes between days. The buffet was minutiously replenished and tidied up. Wide selection of wines. We have earlier had difficulties finding Cypriot wines to our liking, but were recommended a local Syrah wine that we appreciated very much. Dined there twice in the same week.",Evohia
40,"Evohia Lounge Bar & Buffet restaurant is situated opposite the (main) Hilton Hotel.Easy to locate when entering the city.The Buffet format offers a wide range of options in a nice lay out.The variety of choices provides something for every guest. All salads and dishes look and taste freshly made. The Cypriot specialties are available but some people do prefer the more European varieties.Main courses in Pork, Chicken, Lam & several fish varieties.Hard not to make too many rounds. And always keep in mind : there is a tempting choice in sweet desertsStaff is very polite, friendly & helpful.As recently settled CY-residents we enjoy to explore the traditional places in and around Nicosia, but we definitely will return to Evohia. Sometimes to please guests who are not too CY-food minded but surely to please ourselves another time.",Evohia
40,"Well-designed and pleasant restaurant, opposite Hilton Hotel. Buffet, with a good range of options. Iamnot normally a fan of buffets butthis was good and offered palatable and nutritius food. Salads were especilly good. Nice layout and good range of options. A bit too eclectic for my taste but Cypriot specialities were there. Functional and tasty without being of gourmet level. Restaurant was not at all busy on night of visit.",Evohia
50,I have visited evohia restaurant several times...It has never disappointed me...excellent choice...nice food. .nice environment ..very friendly staff. ..I strongly recommend it!!,Evohia
50,"A really good buffet with a great variety of choices, everyone would like! Freshly made salads , great variety of meats and fish too. Cheese cake for a desert! Best of",Evohia
40,"The buffet is very rich, mainly local food and European. Variety of salads and starters, and good main course, fish, pork, chicken and lam. You can't avoid making few rounds, come hungry. The sweet desert choice is tempting, be careful!",Evohia
40,"Although I am not a big fan of buffets, the options were delicious and varied, providing something for everyone in our party and for all appetites!",Evohia
50,The buffet style food makes this restaurant a great value for money! There is not a single chance that you will leave hungry. The atmosphere is also great and the specific night we visited the restaurant the staff were also extremely polite and helpful. Would definitely visit again.,Evohia
40,Nicely placed walkable across the road from the Hilton hotel best to book.Buffet style meal at a set price of Greek food. Friendly staff and pleasant restaurant don't sit on the conservatory unless you are a smoker!,Evohia
40,A place where you can get a nice buffet with a resoable price and it's suitable for family and business . Highly recommended,Evohia
30,"I went there with my wife and some 20 friends last Thursday evening. As usual, I was impressed with the great variety of food, the choice is so rich, Cypriot, Mediterranean and international dishes, tasty salads. Location near Cyprus Hilton hotel makes it very easy to find and reach. Convenient and ideal for business lunches/dinners or other social events. But I still find the chairs too heavy...I will complain to the management next time...",Evohia
50,At lunches they have got a buffet The food really taste good Its a vegetarian friendly Please taste the spinach laxania its reallyyyyyyyyy good,Evohia
50,"Our cousins surprised us with a wonderful lunch at Evohia restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious and the service excellent. The buffet consisted of a wide range of traditional Cypriot dishes, very authentic and beautifully cooked. I would definitely visit again and recommend it unreservedly.",Evohia
30,Not a huge variety but the dishes are descent and tasty enough. The staff is quite polite and helpfull.,Evohia
40,"This was yet another visit to this restaurant for lunch , and is always up to the very good standards I have experienced in the recent years, though I must admit that the buffet lunch this time did not offer the same wide choice as my last visit. Some good dishes have been eliminated? However, whatever was there on display , was very good and tasty - apart from a meat dish which was not only overcooked, but burned - and eat as much as you wish . Service was prompt and professional. All in all, a good choice at surprisingly low prices for the choice and quality provided.",Evohia
30,"We often have meals in this restaurant and they are always quite good. When we last visited however on Easter day for dinner, it was a completely different situation: tasteless food that did not seem freshly cooked and food that was undercooked (eg the penne). Other than that, the decor of this place is lovely and the staff are very professional.",Evohia
50,"We were at this restaurant for lunch; the reservation was perfectly handled and the reception was very warm.The restaurant is in a prime location on the other side of the Hilton Hotel; with ample private parking space. It is huge with two floors; the upper floor is superbly decorated; elegant, rich and relaxing, with a very pleasant outdoor area.Although a Buffet is served; the service was so efficient and warm; finished plates were removed fast and cutlery replaced.The buffet was so rich with a great variety; you will always find what you like to eat any day; a dozen different salads with many dips and sauces; the entree dishes included a huge variety of pastas, fish, meats, and vegetables, as for dessert; several cakes and sweets as well as fruit salad and fresh fruits.All the food we ate was extremely tasty and delicious; the prices are very low compared to the environment, service and food quality.One little recommendation is to have a tag describing the main entree dishes.",Evohia
10,"Food average, friendly waiters but I think in general is not the best place to dine !! Not value for money and not much taste in food",Evohia
50,"Evohia is a lovely place for lunch time. It is right across he road from the Hilton and has a spacious parking.I've been there so, so many times over the years and the quality has never changed.They have a lunch buffet with salads, international but also Cypriot cuisine.The food and service never disappoint, ideal for business lunch but also with friends and family.",Evohia
40,"Buffet was really rich, especially for those fasting (before Christmas or Easter). The service and food are excellent. The type of food is mostly traditional Cypriot cousine, so its good to try if you have a foreigner visiting and you want them to experience something else than meze.",Evohia
50,"One of the best restaurants in Nicosia, very clean, good location with parking behind. Very good quality of food for 11.90€ per person only!",Evohia
50,"Whenever you decide to dine at evohia you know for sure that you will enjoy plenty of food, variety of good food always at the highest quolity.",Evohia
50,This is a good buffet restaurant across the road from Hilton Cyprus. There is not a lot in the area so this was a Godsend. The food is good quality and massively plentiful. The lamb is particularly good. There is a lot of choice for vegetarians too. I would strongly recommend this place. The drinks were not cheap but not expensive either and the food is good value at €11.90 for as much as you can eat. We went back twice. Really good.,Evohia
40,"Being n town for business for a couple of days I was looking for a lunch or dinner place hereby the hotel, in case we din't want to move too far. Evohia was a good choice, both price and food wise. It is a buffet restaurant, casual, extremely clean, with good choice and nice service. The food is delicious and affordable - 11 euros. The only minus is the fact that is the same all the time.",Evohia
40,"One of the few places with pulses on the menu. If you are a vegeterian this is a good choice. Close to the Hilton this place is a good, fast food slowly cooked solution. The prices are very user friendly!",Evohia
50,"This place is a bar come restaurant and is just across the road from the hotel Hilton Cyprus. There are 2 Hiltons in Nicosia so easy to get confused.In the evening it opens at 7:30pm and it's a buffet, cost 11.90 Euros. So help yourself as many times as you want. For the price it was very decent indeed, plenty of choice and something for everyone, even you veggies, you will not be disappointed. A pint of the draft ale (Keo) was 3 Euros which in my book is very decent indeed.Roll up, get seated and start eating, simple as that, no waiting at all and all the dishes were stocked up very regularly.There is nothing around this hotel worth walking to unless you want to walk more than 1 km so plan in advance.We stayed at the Hotel Hilton Cyprus and a sarnie was costing between 16 and 20 Euros, robbery with what's over the road.",Evohia
40,A party of 30 people we had travelled to Nicosia from Wales to attend the football match against Cyprus. We stayed in The Hilton and the restaurant was just across the road. The restaurant doesn't open until 8pm but opened at 6.30pm especially for us so we could eat there before the game. There was a wide range of starters and main course which was very well cooked and presented. The chef continually topped up the food when it ran low. Everyone in the party enjoyed the food and the service. Many of us returned the following evening too!,Evohia
30,"I am a frequent customer at Evohia and i love their buffet food. I always had great time there and left very pleasant. The two last times though was disappointing.The first time i found a hair in my food, the manager came and apologized.The second time i order Sprite and the glass was dirty. So i asked the wairtess to change it. She told me it was from the lemon. I daid to her iok but still i would like it if you changed my glass. She took it and rolled up her eyes as she was leaving. She went to the bar and told her colleague "" omg look, she wants me to change her glass for that!""",Evohia
50,"Excellent buffet and service; wide variety of food, clean and excellent environment architecturally wise. Personnel is very friendly that is why it is preferred for business, social and private meals.",Evohia
40,"The restaurant is also a bar and besides having a really good selection of local wines, they have a buffet. They start serving the food in buffet form at around 20:00 hs, so you can easily enjoy some drinks before getting stuffed on delicious dishes. You can serve yourself as many times as you want, so don't worry about not trying out one of the different plates!",Evohia
40,So nice to grab healthy and delicious foods from the buffet as soon as you walk in. This has to be one of the best value restaurants in Nicosia.,Evohia
50,"Great restaurant mainly for business lunches. The buffet is very good with a good balance of pastas, salads and meat. Its a great restaurant for families as well very good positioned in the entrance of Nicosia opposite the Hilton Hotel.",Evohia
20,Unfortunately we had one of our best meals (Pyxida Fish Tavern) the night before we went to Evohia. Evohia was probably one of our worst meals on our visit to Nicosia. Evohia is buffet style fare. The wait staff were very attentive. You can eat as much as you want but really the quality was very poor. I would not recommend this restaurant.,Evohia
40,I would strongly recommend this restaurant especially for its Sunday buffet lunch! Everything was delicious and they bring fresh food all the time! They service is excellent and a nice place for families!,Evohia
50,"We found this place on the advice of the lady in the local cake shop. Staying at the Hilton it was a five minute walk for some of the best 'homemade' Cypriot food you can eat. The buffet was varied and you only had to request something and it appeared on the next days menu. Potatoes with Okra was our favourite but couldn't complain about anything including the reasonable price for two. Highly recommend, just wish they weren't so far away or would dine there weekly!",Evohia
50,Good found to be ample with quality and a great selection. You have ask for the lady in the kitchen who cooks everything (Maria). Let her know what you think as she is very proud of her creations.,Evohia
50,"Came here and were so pleasantly surprised. Food was so fresh and amazing. Staff are awesome, atmosphere is great. Such good value for money. So much so, this is our second night in a row 😊😊😊",Evohia
40,I've been there for a business lunch. Food and service was quite good. The only disadvantage is that the decoration inside is very old. They have to do a renovation as soon as possible.,Evohia
40,"Healthy, delicious food served with courtesy. Good value and not too busy. It was the daily place to visit for the rich and famous before the ""recession"" I am told.",Evohia
40,"Located right in front of the Hilton hotel, offering buffet choice of selected premium taste goodies which I enjoyed with business friends. The place seems to be popular with businessmen, bankers, politicians etc who enjoy a wide selection of high quality nicely prepared tasty foods. Service was very good though inexplicably by foreign easterners waiters and I could never understand why locals are not being chosen who speak the main local language which is greek. This is a ridiculous feature almost everywhere in Cyprus.In general , this is a good choice, a few kms away from the city centre but easy to locate. A good choice of food, buffet choice at 15 euros per person plus drinks. Ambience is pleasant with soft music. Yes, the place is a good choice.",Evohia
40,"I have been there several times, usually because of various events invited. The buffet is rich, good food and variety and good value for money. Service also good. The atmosphere is nothing special but ok.",Evohia
40,"Evohia, Estiades, Navarino and Prosilio are restaurants of the same chain.But i believe that Evohia is the best ! There is plenty of food, best quality and taste, from a big buffet so that you can choose what you like and as many as you want. The service is quick and proffesional and the prices very good. The drinks, desserts and coffee have extra charge.There is outdoors sitting for summer, but i prefer inside, as is a very well decorated restaurant with nice colours and great atmosphere. Downstairs in a cute private place, we had the christening party of our grandson, using the restaurant's up-stairs buffet and everyone had excellent words to say.I recommend it, for lunch or dinner, with family,couples or friends, even for a special event or for bussiness lunch.",Evohia
40,"I have had lunch or dinner in this restaurant quite a few times in the last few years. It has a simple concept, that of a buffet for all. You get about 6-8 different salad choices and 8 to 10 warm dish ones. Fare does not reach exceptional culinary heights but it's honest with good ingredients and well priced. Drink service on our last visit was quick with drinks served at he right temperature.Would visit again.",Evohia
10,"Went to this restaurant last Sunday for a late lunch. ENVIRONMENT: very dated, inside and out. The outside area which is supposed to be a garden was in essence closed as there is glass all around, so the smell from smoking (which is allowed there) was everywhere. The inside area is very dark and also dated and a bit depressing. FOOD: As we were quite late for lunch (15.00) most of the salads from the buffet were already finished, but on a positive note, the manager ordered a fresh greek salad to be brought to our table. The rest of the food was very oily and in general nothing special in terms of taste. Even though my expectations after lunch were very low, I asked my husband to bring a couple desserts to try at the end. The chocolate mousse was inedible! It was at least 4 days old sitting in a plate in the fridge, and was already dry on the outside. Didn't taste good either. SERVICE: As we were paying for a lunch buffet, we (naively perhaps) thought that desserts were included as well. However, we were surprised to see that we were charged 2.80 euros for each of the horrible desserts! The buffet isnt cheap either, considering the quality and the environment. So, even though the service isn't too bad, I would NEVER go back. There are far more nicer places with much cheaper, tasty and fresh food in town! The place needs a huge rennovation inside and out, in the menu and in their principles of always serving FRESH food.",Evohia
50,"Very nice choice of food at the buffet, nice desserts and nice atmosphere. Very good value of money.",Evohia
30,"Chain restaurant with buffet and without any changes in their menu for many-many years. Of course, their tandoori chicken is good as well as spinach pie, But always the same food, and it is so boring! Nothing new! Last time I was FORCED to go there by my friends, but I don't want to go there, either to Estiades or Prosilio.",Evohia
40,"This is one of the best buffet places in Nicosia, Nice atmosphere, helpful staff. Only drawback is that the desserts are extra!",Evohia
40,I booked it for my sons christianing and everybody loved The food; even the picky ones.Very organized and the service was excellent. The only think I would like to change is a renovation to modernize it.,Evohia
20,Visited the restaurant for a relaxed business lunch. Atmosphere: dark and slightly old fashion Service: not applicable; self service Food: simple buffet Location: new nicosia I would not go again... unless price is the KEY selection criteria.,Evohia
40,"Very good place for family / large group . the quality of food is very good, but it is always the same. good value for money. it is excellent place to try out various local dishes.",Evohia
50,I recoment it because they have a great buffet very very delicious international.. Its a nice cozy place to go and eat and its very near the Hilton hotel on the opposite side..Must try!!,Evohia
40,"Full of business people, this restaurant also offers a takeaway lunch buffet service (you fill a container) however prices for this are hit and miss and I have been shocked sometimes at paying 9 euros for mainly salad! If you eat in its a bit pricey (around 16 euro before drinks) but you can fill your plate as much as you want - so if you are starving its good food!",Evohia
50,"amazing food try it. Its really worth it! Its a buffet, lots of salads, all kinds of meat, pasta and fish all cooked nicely . also desserts to choose from",Evohia
50,"Quality food, fresh ingredients, clean and super yummy! Very reasonale prices too",Evohia
40,top quality restaurant for business lunch/dinner or fast dining food is always very nice and pricing is standard very good policy- you can eat as much as you like deserts need a little improvement value for money,Evohia
30,"I have visited this resturant several times as it is close to my office.The food here is reasonable as far as buffet food goes, but when it comes to quality vs price its nothing more than reasonable.If getting a take out from this resturant I would be very wary, although they base the cost on weight of the food it does depend on who is weighing it, there have been times were 1 small tray of food has ended up costing me €13! which is a very expensive lunch especially when you can eat in and have as much as you want for around €15 during the week.",Evohia
30,"good food, good service usually crowded at noon, reservation necessary",Evohia
50,Evoxia is a very nice restaurant with exceptional Greek food! The buffet is very good with a big variety from tasty salads to crispy chicken. The atmosphere is also very pleasant. Recommended!,Evohia
30,"This restaurant is just a few hundred yards from the Hilton Hotel and if you don't want to pay their prices, try this place. It is a clean medium sized place that has outside seating although it is overlooking a busy main road. The food is a self service buffet at both lunch and dinner. The starters are a variety of salads and pasta. The main courses included local specialities such as moussaka and klefitiko. There was a special offer on the evening we visited and the buffet was 8 euros and witha litre of water and 2 beers came to just 29 euros. Great value and tasty food.",Evohia
