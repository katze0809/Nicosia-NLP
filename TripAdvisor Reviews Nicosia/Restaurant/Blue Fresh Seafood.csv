50,Best food in town for my business associates Excellent service Friendly atmosphere value for money With the most fresh and organic raw materials Convenient location in old town center,Blue Fresh Seafood
50,We visited the restaurant for the first time after a recommendation of a friend. We chose the 15 euro fish meze and we took fish and sushi!! The staff was very friendly and helpful . Everything was fresh and the variety was huge. Sure value for money. Highly recommended!!,Blue Fresh Seafood
10,The food is medium except for the fish. Service and staff do not know how to serve when the restaurant is full.,Blue Fresh Seafood
40,A place to enjoy seafood variety well cooked and served. The place is a little bit noisy and there is quite a lot of delay when the restaurant is very busy. Generally the food is good and the prices reasonable.,Blue Fresh Seafood
10,"We had already eaten in this restaurant, but the last two times the quality and even the quantity have definitely changed. A week ago, we went out with some friends. What a fool! The sardines stank and even the squid did not have the same taste as usually. Of all that we have taken, just the French fries were good, the rest was mediocre. Another thing that I honestly can't stand is that the waiters are kids. I don't see how this is possible in a European country...",Blue Fresh Seafood
40,Located in the old town of Nicosia. They served different kind of fresh fish in the pot or grilled. I tried the grilled Jambo shrimps it was tasty and the vegetables were ok too. The waitress was friendly. I paid around 22 euros including the soft drink.,Blue Fresh Seafood
50,"Excellent food. The ""Fish meze"" was one of the best seafood meals I ever had. Tasty and fresh! Good value for money. Excellent service. The staff was very helpful-the waiters were always polite and upbeat. Very friendly environment. Totally recommended!!!üëåüèº",Blue Fresh Seafood
50,"Nice restaurant in a great location. Great food, very good service, spotless lounge area and toilets. We highly recommend it !!!",Blue Fresh Seafood
50,"Being nice experience, positively surprised about the food compare with the prices. Pretty nice and convenient concept so you can eat as long as you want in a sustainable way. Surprised that you can compare sushi with fish meze. Undoubtedly one of the best tachini I ve ever had and wonderful calamari. The only thing that was kinda bad was the seafood pasta, i felt are in the menu just to give another one option. The toilets were pretty clean but a bit difficult to find your way there due to the structure. Last but not least they could provide water-lemon bowl for hands as long as its fish and some more tissues on the table. Service was such friendly , in a good way and always by the right ration, although sometimes we found it difficult to find our waiter in the restaurant ( due to workflow).Overall amazing, friendly staff, polite and value for money, definitely recommended. Try the sushi and tachini ( not together ) , you ll be surprised!PS: Amazing homemade bread!",Blue Fresh Seafood
50,"The food was really great, enjoyed it a lot, the service was good, and the staff were very pleasant. Suggest this seafood restaurant.",Blue Fresh Seafood
50,"We were looking for meaty or seafood restaurant in Ledra and we found this restaurant. Buffet deal for ‚Ç¨15 only. They have many choices, you just ask them to cook it for you then they will bring them in your table. You can order as much as you want. For dine in only. They also have sushi (taste, so so), seafoods, pizza, pasta and salad. Overall it is cheap and satisfying dinner.",Blue Fresh Seafood
20,Ok maby its because it was 2 days before Christmas and it was over crowded but its not an excuse. Visited for second time. The first I loved it and gave 5stars. The second was more than a disappointment. The waiter a 12-15 years old kid !!! told us very gently that we could not order pasta for the kids ...... because they were very busy........we order 6 plates from the meze and the large shrimps fish from the main menu. One hour and 15‚Äô later we were still waiting for 2 of the 6 plates and the shrimps. Bread came after the first dishes and only when we asked for it. I asked for the bill and everything was charged even though was not served. I informed the staff and they removed the plates that were not served. I talked to the lady at the cashier (maybe the owner) complained and kindly advised her that they should have only as many tables they can serve. To my understanding it was not only me that had a problem but most of the custumers that were there. Its very sad that the organisation is not good because the food is quite nice. I ll give it a last chance in the future.,Blue Fresh Seafood
30,"This restaurant is new in Nicosia and located in the main shopping street of the city center.It is offering fresh fish and a menue at unbeatable prices:Salad, soup, fish and potatoes, Tahini and Tsatziki at a price of 15 ‚Ç¨ per person.Minimum: 2 people. And it is perfect that you can eat as much as you want.You can sit inside or outside.The problem is that the service staff is disorganized at it's best.But a young boy - (14 years old, Panagiotis) - belonging to the owners- has tried to help and to care.Nobody is taking orders. We were sitting and waiting 15 minutes and with the help of the little boy one of the waiters came to take our order.Of course in the meantime many other guests have arrived and were able to make their orders.For starters we got from the house bread, lemon and olives.We ordered out the extensive wine list a bottle of Amethystos blanc white wine from the domain of Costa Lazaridi, offered at a price of 24,00 ‚Ç¨.Now we got our menue:The Tsatziki was of average taste.The fish soup was looking more like a vegetable soup with little, small and thin pieces of white fish in it.The taste was sour.The sea bream was fresh and of good taste. The greek salad was typical and nothing special.The French Fries were ok.The restaurant is very (!!) noisy and was completed.On a Sunday at lunch time only local people with plenty of young children and babies were sitting in the restaurant.None of the waiters has removed the finished meals and plates from the table.Our order for a digestif was forgotten.At the Bar you can pay your bill.Visa-Card will be accepted.My subjective rating:Service: 1 pointValue for money: 5 pointsQuality and preparation of meals: 3 pointsAmbiance: 3 points",Blue Fresh Seafood

The menu includes a whole variety of dishes from fresh seafood, pastas, pizza and sushi. Ingredients are of high quality, mostly fresh and bio for a very fair price. This was one of the best dining experiences we ever had. We will visit again! Thanks!",Blue Fresh Seafood
40,"Very good restaurant in the center of Nicosia. The salad we ordered was fresh, the lavraki and the sword kebab nicely cooked and priced better than average considering how expensive fish restaurants are in Cyprus. Missed some points on the service side that although very friendly was slightly slow. It was Sunday lunch time and the restaurant was packed. Not a big issue though and will definitely visit this place again as my doctor recommended eating more fish than meat.",Blue Fresh Seafood
50,"Crossed the resto many times but never check in since my favorite on in Ledras street was a few metres away. Today is was closed amd i dont know why. So I said to my wife. Lets try it.

50,"Initially we were planning to dine in another restaurant, but it was closed to we decided to check out this one. And had no regrets.We ordered fish meze for 15‚Ç¨, which (for us) included greek salad with absolutely amazing feta cheese, the best one we have ever tried; smoked eggplant salad, rather a dip, very delicious, too; grilled cuttlefish, octopus and sea bream, with kosher salt and lemon squeezed, yum; mussels pilaf; oven baked potatoes and battered cod with garlic sauce. Everything was very fresh and amazingly cooked. This offer included unlimited supplements to the order, too bad we were too full to eat more haha. Pity we visited Nicosia for one day only otherwise we would return. The service was great, everything was on our table minutes after the order. The gentleman who served us was very friendly and helpful. We were also served a snack of bread with herbs and olives as well as very juicy and sweet melon free of charge.All this cost 35‚Ç¨, great price for the experience we had.",Blue Fresh Seafood
30,i was expecting much better. quality of was average. service was ok. but slow. price ‚Ç¨ 15 for 33 dishes plus sushi... is ok if u dont care for quality. i do.,Blue Fresh Seafood

50,"More than value for money, totaly worth it. I fish my self and I have high expectations when it comes to fish. All fresh and well cooked - thank you!!",Blue Fresh Seafood
30,"We decided to visit the restaurant because the ""all fish you can eat"" sounds cool. It is indeed a good concept. The execution though is not so successful. Although the restaurant had only a few tables to serve the service was poor. A kind and helpful young lady struggling to assist the customers and the bosses hanging around. Fish was overcooked for our taste. Bakalaos was hot outside and cold inside. Nice pasta.",Blue Fresh Seafood
50,"We visited the restaurant with friends. Ordering from the all-you-can-eat menu is a new concept for Nicosia, maybe even Cyprus. The options provided both for the all-you-can-eat menu as well as the a-la-carte menu are ample and eclectic. The prices are very reasonable, especially considering that there are many offerings with biological ingredients. And the food itself was very well cooked and very tasteful. Service was impeccable, fast and friendly. We had the all-you-can-eat option and we really liked the fact that they brought out small quantities at a time so as not to waste and throw away food. Whenever we needed more, we just asked and they brought more. End result was bellies full, almost zero waste.As a local, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite places. This is a must place to visit and eat at when in Cyprus.",Blue Fresh Seafood
50,Amazing quality and quantity of food and definitely value for money. Everything we tried was freshly made. Great hospitality and surely recommended.,Blue Fresh Seafood

50,"A very good idea of offering fish meze for a 15 euro fee. You can order from a menu of 33 dishes plus sushi dishes. You can have as much as you like and order again and again, all included in the 15 euro price. The food itself was well cooked and tasty. Even pizza is included from the shop across the street, which they also own. The staff were very friendly and helpful. A new and great experience which as time passes will definitely become more and more popular.",Blue Fresh Seafood
