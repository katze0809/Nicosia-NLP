50,Traditional Greek tavern. Reminds the taverns in Plaka with the many small different plates. All freshly made. I was really happy since my last visit as it seems that the cats disappeared. I like animals but i have a fear with cats. I dont like sitting next to them or sitting on a chair that a cat was sitting before. I am more a dogs person. So i have the chance now to enjoy all that great food without worrying that a cat will sit on my legs. Definitely will visit again,Kathodon
50,"Kathodon is a tradition Greek restaurant that is very close to the Turkish border. It is on Ledras street but away from the tourists. In fact, you can see the border from the restaurant. The food was delicious. The Grilled Octopus is highly recommended.",Kathodon
50,"The restaurant is in a busy location, right next to the crossing point. It looked lovely and inviting so after travelling from Paphos we decided to have our lunch there. Warm welcome, got seated comfortably. Once we looked at the menu, I was a bit worried, the presentation of it all looked very touristy. I can not comment on other dishes but we decided to go for fish meze and it did present a good value and a lot of food for 2 people. Everything we tried, was fresh and nicely prepared. The service was very attentive and all in all, the place surpassed our expectations. I assume it would be lovely for a dinner too. Thank you all the team, would not hesitate to come back.",Kathodon
50,"Generous, Tasty local food. The restaurant will first attract you with its decor and its location on the borders. Then when you enter and meet the kindest staff you will feel at home. The wine though is WOW.",Kathodon
40,"Next to the border, and in the main Old Nicosia. Greek restaurant with tasty dishes, I loved the grilled meat.",Kathodon
40,"Nice, vivid atmosphere, most of the staff was attentive and friendly. The day we visited there were two musicians playing music and that gave an extra touch to the place. The food was good and plenty.",Kathodon
50,"We visited the restaurant twice, on Wednesday night and on Friday night. The owner managed to find a solution a friend that eats Kosher food. Besides this creative solution, the food was very good and the music and atmosphere were great.So we reserved a table for Friday night, payed in advance and returned to enjoy (good that we reserved as the restaurant was full).All in all, a very nice experience",Kathodon
10,"On arrival no smiles from waiters, could not sit where wanted and had to find alternative table. Got settled. a waiter refused to help me with menu explanation signalling the other guy was my waiter. He did and we ordered. My lamb souvlaki was 3 very small lamb kebabs, not souvlaki at all. Good but small. The salad was an overload of cous cous, no leaves, tomato, cucumber or actual salad? But husband's shrimp pasta was the pits! A bowl of pasta in tomato sauce with 3 half filled shrimps on top, even the tails were empty. The waiter was lovely and explained the pasta only came with 3 shrimps and he was unable to do anything.looking around it seems if you order lots of mezze you get a good deal but we went cheap and it was! Lesson learned!",Kathodon
30,Helpful personnel but food was terrible. At least my plate. I have tried others and it was ok. Mine was junk. I ordered ofto kleftiko.,Kathodon
50,"The house serviettes say “to spiti sas” (“your second home”) - and this was certainly true for us. During our 8 day holiday based in Nicosia we visited 3 times, twice in the evening and once at lunchtime, and each time enjoyed excellent food and friendly, helpful service. The kleftiko (slow roasted lamb) was excellent, as were the aubergine pies and the house special salad, to mention a few things we particularly liked. Little touches like the Mastika liqueur and mini bitter orange cream desert (to complement a full meal) added to our enjoyment. This restaurant is in an unusual location, 20 metres or so from the “Green Line” border with the northern Turkish-controlled part of the city, projecting out into the pedestrian Ledra street. However the tall glass screens separate diners from the streams of passers-by. We received a strong recommendation, and have no hesitation in repeating it ourselves. We shall be back!",Kathodon
40,"On our first trip to the old part of the city, just before you reach the Turkish side is this restaurant, we were lucky on a Saturday to get a table at lunchtime as fully booked. Managed to get table outside. Sipping a bottle of Rose followed by the Meze, that’s the hot one, cost around £27 each, but what a treat we were in for. The food came out gradually, course after course, each platter as tasty as the first, until after what seemed like hours, we could eat no more, how we wanted to finish as so tasty, however had to leave food.",Kathodon
50,"In the heart of the old town, it offers a remarkable taste experience compined with good service! And in the evenings you can have all that with live greek music in the background.",Kathodon
40,Really nice in whit and blue decor. Dishes are quite tasty and lots of variety. Prices are good. Nicely cooked.,Kathodon
50,Deliciousss food. Best scampi saganaki and best Ofton I have ever eaten! Big portions and modest price. I can only recommend it!,Kathodon
50,"It is in front of the check point. Very friendly staff, I ate a wonderful pork cooked with honey and spices, the best in my life. Very nice athmosphere, typical cypriot one. You can find there many local people.",Kathodon
50,"I visited Kathodon (based on my hotel receptionist's recommendation when I inquired for a place with live Greek music) on a Saturday night, so it very busy. But a small table was nevertheless found and moved inside and placed next to the two performing musicians, for which I was very grateful. The food was excellent, the atmosphere relaxed, the prices very reasonable, and the music fantastic. The clients appeared to be a mixture of locals (many families) with a few tourists such as me. I will happily return next time I am in Nicosia.",Kathodon
50,The food is always good and the music excellent! The owner is very friendly and greets all visitors. We go there every year when we visit Nicosia.,Kathodon
40,"This restaurant occupies a prime position at the northern end of Ledra Street, within sight of the Ledra Crossing point into Lefkoşa (the Turkish-occupied northern part of the city. I walked past it many times, and it was always busy with diners, but difficult to judge whether that was because it was a good restaurant or because it was in a high tourist footfall area, enticing in hungry and thirsty visitors. It definitely reminded of a traditional taverna in Greece; it certainly has a welcoming and relaxed feel about it, and a number of suitable menu items, so I decided to give it a go on my last night in Lefkosia.It was a good choice, and I had a very enjoyable and tasty dinner here. The affable waiter, in polite conversation, told me that the restaurant’s name meant ‘En Route’. It was certainly appropriate, considering its location by a border crossing that many people make on a daily basis as they travel from one part of a divided city to the other. And no doubt there are many locals who long to be en route to a reunification of a divided city.The restaurant has a large outside seating area, and an inside air conditioned dining area. I sat outside so I could observe the passing parade. It was very civilised. There are no steps so the restaurant is very suitable for those requiring mobility assistance.The menu has a great mix of traditional Cypriot, Greek and Turkish dishes, as well as a selection from the wider Mediterranean area. It specialises in Kleftiko, and fish and prawn dishes. There’s numerous vegetarian and vegan options, as well as a choice of dishes for the gluten intolerant. For starters I chose a couple of small dishes: the Greek Zucchini Ball, and. Chickpea Fritter. Both were fresh, piping hot, and delicious. My main was a traditional Moussaka, served with fries and a small portion of pomegranate salad. It too was very good. I accompanied the meal with a small bottle of Cypriot rosé. It too was good.Service was cheerful and observant, without being intrusive. As a solo diner I was well looked after, and did not feel hurried, despite the restaurant being very busy. At the conclusion of the meal I was offered a complimentary small dessert and after-dinner drink. The bill came to €17.90, a very reasonably-priced dinner in my opinion.In some respects the meaning of the restaurant came alive toward the end of my meal. A large group of demonstrators marched past, carrying banners and chanting, and gathered by the Ledra Street crossing to continue their protest, accompanied by a band of musicians. I was told it was a demand for unification, and for freedom of passage, and that such protests are happening frequently. Hopefully the citizens on Nicosia, and indeed Cyprus, will soon be en route to unification and the freedom that such an act will bring. It didn’t impede on my dining experience in any way; it just made it a little more meaningful.I well recommend this restaurant!",Kathodon
50,"Located in the shopping district of Nicosia, Kathodon is a traditional Greek taverna and offers excellent authentic Cypriot cuisine and great service. We tried several dishes (mezedes) and enjoyed every dish, including stuffed grape leaves, grilled chicken and pork kebabs, Kleftiko,Haloumi, homus, tzatziki, grilled sausage, soutzoukakia and salads. The atmosphere was friendly and the Owner/mamanger went out of his way to show his hospitality. kathodon will be the first restaurant to visit, on our next trip to Nicocia!",Kathodon
50,Loved the food there - we even went there twice on our short stay in Nicosia because we liked it so much :) also the waiters were very nice and funny :),Kathodon
50,"Visited numerous times through the years. The owners maintain high quality of standards and reasonable prices. The meze plate will satisfy even the most demanding customers.Single plates of Constantinoupole origins are delightful and plenty.You need to make a reservation for the weekend, sometimes gets very busy on weekdays as well.",Kathodon
50,"After 2 years wife and me are back at this restaurant. And again we had the same meal: kleftiko (slowly cooked lamb leg) with greek salad and fava on a side. Just perfectly cooked meal! Bravo to chef, owner and all the waiters! We'll be coming here again for sure!",Kathodon
20,"Had to wait loooong for the waiter to order and to pay. Food portion was very small and overpriced. Food quality was bad, even the pitta bread was really crunchy.",Kathodon
50,"I was there with a colleague, the restaurant has been indicated to me by a colleague living in Nicosia.The waiter was friendly and funny, he explained us some recipes and also the content of the some special dishes recommending us for a special lamb.We took a lot of dishes to try the Cyprus food and we were very happy to find very good tastes and great level of cooking.Meat is great, cooked as we wanted and in very short time.The waiter was also able to speak italian and we chatted a little bit.The great dessert (orange jam and yogurth) was divine ! and we spoke a lot about it with the waiter.Price is very low compared to what we ate and its qualityI will come back there for sure next time ! ! !",Kathodon

20,Long time ago this used to be a good restaurant. However this is no longer the case. Food quality and service have deteriorated significantly. What a pity,Kathodon
50,"The seafood meze was very good indeed, and the morokanella wine from the Nicosia region was an excellent accompaniment. Service was friendly but a bit too laid back.",Kathodon
50,"Nice taverna with fresh products, the fish mezzedes were very good: kalamari fried, octopus, fresh fish grilled, tarama... Excellent choice in the center of Nicosia!",Kathodon
40,"We visited Kathodon several times, we always had a very pleasant dinner there. Inside the restaurant is a comfortable place, but most times overcowded. We were eating meat meze (excellent!), lamb with mustard and honey gravy (outstanding) and a good kleftiko.The prices were fair, I can recommend this place.",Kathodon
50,"Visited this place during quick trip to the Capital. We ordered a Meat Meze for three, there was enough to feed six people. Great food, great service, highly recommend and not a bad price.",Kathodon
50,"Had dinner here tonight. We came relatively early and were accommodated easily even though it was Friday evening. (By the time we left the restaurant was packed.)The selection of food offered is excellent including daily specials.The service was fine. The atmosphere pleasant. Many interesting photographs snd decorations on the walls.The food was outstanding, the best we’ve had since arriving in Nicosia four days ago - and we have been eating very well all along.There was pleasant live music after 9:00 PM.

30,"The taste of the food is above average. However, mezedes are overpriced as they are not enough in quantity. Excellent music (they have live music during weekends) and good service. Not recomending this place for friends nightout.",Kathodon

30,"We stopped by for a late lunch after shopping across the border. I ordered Lamb chops and when it arrived, i nearly fell off my chair. The portion was HUGE. There was eight, yes 8 chops.The only down point is that there were lots of cats around the tables. We had 9 just around ours. Whilst i love cats, my friend is terrified of them. These are feisty and reach up to try and grab the food. The staff did nothing to stop them or move them off.",Kathodon
40,"Not having booked, we were lucky to find a table on a Friday night after 9.00 pm, albeit outside but the heaters were effective, though not environmentally friendly. There was live Greek music which we enjoyed. The menu is typical of a taverna with a variety of grilled meats and fish. We shared a mixed platter, village salad and tsatsiki which was plenty for two and the local wines, while not great, were a good compliment to the food. Service was excellent despite the restaurant being full and prices very reasonable for the quality of the food. All in all, a lovely evening.",Kathodon

40,We visited the crossing into Northern Cyprus and had a lovely lunch at this restaurant on the South side. The restaurant is full of inter seating photos of local celebrities and ordinary people.

50,"This is the first restaurant we dined at on our visit to Nicosia. It is situated at the top of Ledra Street, just before the border crossing.The portions are huge and the prices are really reasonable. You cannot go wrong here as there is such a choice. The owner obviously takes great pride in his enterprise and was seen walking around the tables, chatting to the diners and keeping the waiters and waitresses on their toes. Excellent customer service and great food.What an absolute gem of a location where you can enjoy your meal right on the pavement front.Would highly recommend and would love to return on our next visit to Cyprus.",Kathodon

30,"Went here on our last day (stayed in northern Cyprus, but like Greek food more) so we were hoping for lots of great food. It turned out to be mezes (small bites) and it was a lot pricier than restaurants we visited nearby (southern part) it was really focussed on tourists; free shot and mini dessert for everyone. One waiter was very unfriendly, he put stuff on the table with so much reluctance and without even saying anything/looking at us. This was also he waiter i asked if I could pay; I gave him money and asked for some money back so they had a very generous tip (more than 10%) and he didn't come back with the money? So this made my tip a more than 20% tip which they absolutely didn't deserve.. (yes could've asked for my money, but he was gone and felt embarrassed and shocked)",Kathodon
50,"I had dinner here. The location is at the end of Ledras street near the crossing point to TRNC. There were many Greek and Cypriot food choices with good drink choices.

50,"The food and service is exceptional. The establishment takes strides to emphasize the traditional Greek and Cypriot selections of food. The street tables are nice to watch the day go by and the waiters are very knowledgeable of the cuisine. I recommend the spicy cheese dip and pita, of which, is a family recipe. The main courses are sumptuous and prepared authentic. I recommend this restaurant for it's genuineness.",Kathodon

40,"Ate here twice--once on the recommendation of one of the bartenders at Brew Fellas (which is right around the corner) and again for lunch before my flight since most of the places weren't opening for another 30 minutes to an hour. The grilled meats I had were very good, although I think one of the other places was slightly better. However, this place had the best seftalia I had of any of the places I went to, and I had seftalia in every place I ate in Nicosia.",Kathodon

The dips were special, the grilled octopus was exceptional, the smoked, grilled pork was unique and delicious and tender, the Smyrna meatballs were unforgettable, and the vegetarian entrees, particularly the lentils, the mushrooms, and the artichoke were all best-in-class. I will be going back here many, many times. If you have a chance, chat with the owner. He's a fascinating and deep guy. He and his team clearly care DEEPLY about make food as good as it can possibly be.",Kathodon
50,"We were shopping in Ledra Street and were in need of sustenance. Katharine looked appealing and the Menu extensive, so we decided to give the place a try. Pleasant welcome from Mine Host and we sat inside - it was very busy outside - and glad we did because of the Cypriot Design on the interior. Something we would have otherwise missed. A pleasant polite Waitress supplied Menus and we had Drinks of Water - Driving Again - and White Wine whilst we decided on our food choices. After much thought, we decided on Pork Kebab with Sheftalia and Canneloni both of which were served with Chips & Salad. Oh and the Chips were Proper Real Potato Chips which was triffic. Excellent Food with the Kebab particularly nice. The Afternoon was finished off with a Shot and when I refused due to driving, I was presented with a small local dessert. Prices are Excellent and a thoroughly enjoyable time was had.",Kathodon
50,Wonderful experience! I suggesto to those who want to try tipical food to eat there their special lamb dish. It is a dream. :),Kathodon

40,"I was walking in the area at night, looking for a place to eat after a long day at a conference. I was attracted to this place immediately because it looked nice, and it is spacious. I sat indoors as it was January, and I ordered a Greek Salad, and a chicken skewers and rice dish. First of all, when the salad arrived I didn't know it would have onions, and I requested that they remove them. They didn't hesitate. The salad was good after that, and the chicken and rice portion was quite large, I didn't finish it, and they gave me a box and I took it back to the hotel.The chicken was cooked well and marinated nicely.The price of the whole meal, with a bottle of water, was under 20 euros.",Kathodon
50,"Dinner with a colleague, but the local is suitable for familly, friends and casual bussines gatherings.Fish meze was our choice, everything tasteful and the quantities enough for some others.The atmosphere is very cosy and the staff friendly.

50,"Kathodon, was the first restaurant that opened at the end of Ledra street(central shopping street in the old city of Nicosia), after the events of 1974 within a few meters from the line of demarcation.When the Ledra str. check point opened a few years ago, the restaurant became a well known dining place, next to the line. People dining can see the crossing point and part of the no mans land.Offers a variety of Greek and Cypriot dishes.You can not go wrong by trying the meze(lots of dishes in small portions) or order a la card.From my side , kleftico is recommented(lamb ,slow cooked in the oven).All kind of drinks,coffee and Greek desrts.",Kathodon
50,"At the center of town, just a few meters from the Green line across Nicosia, this place is always busy offering a large variety of traditional Cypriot & Greek dishes as well as daily specials. Service was great and the food came in large portions. Everything was of good quality and delicious. This place comes highly recommended for meat lovers and those who are around city center and want to try traditional food.",Kathodon
50,"I choose the fish meze, but there was available the meat meze and the vegetarian meze as well. Quality, quantity, variety. Everityhing was delicious and tasteful.

The secret is not eat everything but taste everything.Not expensive for the european standards. Definitely to repeat the visit.",Kathodon
50,"On a Sunday with a slight hangover two of us decided to go for a walk round town. After much deliberation we decided that we would head in here for a local delicacy. We opted for the mixed meat mezze which is 16 dishes and enough to feed 4 probably.It is salads, cheese, meat, bread, dips, meat, chips, meat, dips and meat? Not sure if I mentioned chicken?What a feast. You gotta try this.Quality.",Kathodon
30,"We went there on a Sunday for lunch. It was packed early on. The service was slow. Friendly but slow and uncoordinated. We left and they still hadn't sent the extra bread basket we asked. The complimentary fruit platter at the end was a joke to be honest but we did appreciate the mastic liquer. Actually, that could be the only reason we might give them another chance. The food was ok but especially the pork chop, the yiaourtlou and pasta but the chicken kebab was a small portion. Additionally, they have a serious problem with stray cats. There must have been at least ten cats running around under tables begging for food. I didn't mind that much but my friend was furious. She is allergic and she jumped off her seat a hundred times. I mean I love cats but it isn't the most hygienic to have them running around your restaurant, is it? Even if it's at the end of Ledras.",Kathodon
30,Very good food. Very nice Place. The only negative thing is the live music. It's impossible to talk.,Kathodon
50,Had a meal there on a business trip. Great local food and wine. The staff is really knowledgeable and kind. Really recommended!,Kathodon
40,went here with some guys from work on an afternoon had chicken snitchnel I think that's how its spelt it was served with fries salad and some type of creamy sauce not bad did the job went home content and another restaurant off my must visit list.,Kathodon
40,"Visited with wife, unplanned, whilst on an unexpected visit to Nicosia. Warm Friday at end of November, sat on terrace, had a Greek salad, a slow cooked pork and lamb and would happily have stayed longer. Next time, perhaps...",Kathodon
30,We have visited the restaurant twice after being urged of friends.Even though the place has one of the biggest menus I have ever seen the food is average.Additionally the restaurant is located in a crowded place and the chairs are too close between tables.,Kathodon
30,"The place can feel a little cramped, especially when you are there as part of a large group. The service is good and the food is ok. If you want an ok meal just go there for a pork chop served with a side of fries. Neither good not bad, this is as average as it gets.",Kathodon
30,This restaurant is right by the crossing into the Turkish side of the island and is an interesting place. We had a decent enough lunch there but not without a couple of niggles.Our welcome was friendly and we were handed menus. It was then that up selling started. We only wanted a light lunch but were constantly being pushed towards big main courses and adding on other dishes. We held firm and then our welcome didn’t seem so friendly any more.The food was decent without being exceptional and the prices probably a little higher than off the beaten track. We were also constantly pestered by cats but this seems fairly standard around here.All that said we had an enjoyable visit but won’t go back.,Kathodon
50,"If you are a tourist in Nicosia, its a place to visit. In the old town on the border, live traditional singer in the evening and tasty food.",Kathodon
50,Nice atmosphere with outdoor seating. I had a Greek salad which i'd recommend. Its at a good vantage point to watch people going over the border crossing. It gets very busy at lunch so if you want quiet place its maybe less for you. But big thumbs up and would go again!Recommend the Cypriot sweets for dessert.,Kathodon
30,A traditional Greek restaurant offering plenty of menu choices. We especially enjoyed the vegetarian starters. Nice settings and good service.,Kathodon
40,I had the sea bream. The staff were happy to provide with salad and it was very good. It’s a great place to people watch. The 1/3 bottle of dry white looked dubious but was actually quite good. Service is efficient.,Kathodon
40,"Booked in advance by email and glad I did . The restaurant gets very busy with tourists and locals alike . Good menu plenty of choice . We went for a meat Meze for two people , delicious food and plenty of it . Good service throughout our lunch . Mr Sakis was a great host.",Kathodon
40,Nice service good food!! Traditional greek atmosphere with live music!! A little expensive for students..,Kathodon
50,"food here is of a very good standard and its location on ledra street is excellent. if you are in Nicosia then this is well worth a visit if you like very good food at very reasonable prices, the wild mushrooms are the best I have ever tasted.",Kathodon
50,"Everything was perfect. Service, quality, atmosphere was more than 5*. The best option in Nicosia and very reasonable prices. We will be back!!",Kathodon
30,Its nice restaurant with good food. On Average level but its one of the best restaurant on this street. At the high hours it's full and it's better to make an reservation.,Kathodon
40,"Nice, typically greek/cypriot restaurant with a lot of meze plates. nice and friendly personnel, good traditional greek cuisine would go again taste the ""tsipouro E"", very very very nice",Kathodon
40,Good food but very poor service. No explanation for later as not busy but the the proprietor and his staff were all the same. Clear that we were seen as one time only customers and locals had preference The atmosphere ruined our meal and evening.,Kathodon
50,"1 of the best ""meze"" restaurants in old Nicosia.Located in Ledras walking street.the service is very fast. the quality of the food is very tasty and the staff very friendly.there is also live music.but if you go in summer have in mind that it is very hot to sit outside",Kathodon
40,Visit the Kathodon resturand for a nice meal. Perfect for tourists to have an esence of the Greekcyprus culture cuisine. Perfect for a bussines lunch and at night it transforms in very good join. Few meters from there you will see the checkpoint/ crosing to the OCCUPIED from Turkey area in the north.,Kathodon
50,Good quality of food but what impressed me the most is the super service! The location is great and the live music creates a lovely atmosphere,Kathodon
50,It has atmosphere and its at the end of Ledra str where you can see the boarders the last deviated city in Europe. The food its decent for the location of the place.,Kathodon
50,"Just had an excellent pork shank and lamb chops that were slowly baked in oven. This is traditional Cypriot way of preparing it, very juicy, flesh is basically very very easily removed from the bone, just perfect! We also had local draught beer and red wine, very nice! This is the second time we're in here, everything is the same, the way we love it! Do come here if you're really hungry and want to get away from your all-inclusive 5-star resort!",Kathodon
40,"The restaurant is quite nice and cozy. It's suitable for couples, friends or business meetings. The service is good and the staff friendly. It's greek cuisine with a variety of dishes for everyone. The main thing is that the food is good and tastefull. Enjoy!",Kathodon
40,"Visited with a group of friends. Located at the end of Ledras street. Staff are helpful and kind.There are various choices at the menu for food.At meze the food is plenty. Food was very good, tastefull with quality. At Friday night we went there was live music. Prices were very good.We were pleased from our visit there.Recommended!!!",Kathodon
40,Generally good food and a variety of dishes. There is live Greek music during the summer period. I am not sure if they have live music during winter. Offers outdoor covered sitting as well.There is a huge selection from dishes to choose from and the majority of them are very good. I ve been there 3-4 times and most of the times is was a very good experience. We went there for a work related dinner as well and the service was good considering that we were a large group.I will go there again.,Kathodon
40,"Warm atmosphere, delicious plates in meze style,gentle personnel ,music anthem from 70s,80s and 90s travelling your mind. Check the photos full of memories and meet the owner while he is offering you ouzo or masticha liquor.",Kathodon
40,I have tried multiple times this place and i have always been satisfied with the food. The staff is polite and it has a cosy atmosphere. Good prices and occasionally live music.,Kathodon
50,"Nicosia is worth a visit, if you spend more than a few days on Cyprus. The historical center is not very large. After strolling through the streets looking for a nice restaurant for lunch, we came upon the Kathodon. It is located on Lidras St., very close to the border with the Turkish sector of the city. The waiter was friendly and helpful - good advice about what to eat (and what is not so good). So, we had an excellent lunch. There were many Cypiots (always a good sign to see locals), but also many tourists (including us...). There is an excellent appetizer with spicey melted feta cheese; seafood is very good; ""Greek salad; and spicey friend zucchini.",Kathodon
50,Traditional greek/cypriot food.Tasted delicious.The staff were curteous. The owner even spared some time to talk with us about how he started or restarted.This is a good spot to stop when visiting Lefkosa - just a few steps away from the UN check point.We ate outside and this afded to our enjoyment.really relaxed service and atmosphere.Worth a visit.,Kathodon
50,Good honest Greek food. Very attentive and polite staff. Quick service. Recommend the tzatziki the eggplant dip the seftalia and the kleftiko. With ouzo BArbayianis the perfect combination. Also live Greek music is a plus for this place that lies at Greek/ Turkish Cyprus border in Nicosia,Kathodon
50,A great traditional Greek eatery combining meet dishes with politiki cuisine and the best melitzanosalata (eggplant dip) and kolokythokeftedes (fried zucchini and fetta balls) in town. Here it is not about the ambience (even though they have soft light Greek music on occasions) but rather all about the food. Highly recommended - you cannot go wrong with anything you try.,Kathodon
40,"This is a greek cuisine restaurant with amazing meat meze ( tapas) store manager was super polite to give us for free a Baklava and some masticha liquer glasses. It is located right on the tip of Ledras street. where people cam cross and visit the turkish speaking part of the city. Highlu suggest you ask your hotel for booking if you are planning to eat here for dinner, As it was fully booked and appeared to be a local favorite restaurant.",Kathodon
10,Really rude because we didn't have a reservation and asked for a table outside. We didn't stay to find out more,Kathodon
40,"We went on a Monday night and surprised to see it was busy. We were a mixed group with veggies and non-pork eaters. They made selection easy by having meze for all 3. Room was nice, with a couple of great dishes. Service was fast and efficient. Music provided by man playing guitar. All in all an enjoyable evening out as you are in centre of town and can the go for a walk. Great place to take guests to the island. Price around 20euros pp.",Kathodon
30,"A nice restaurant at the end of Ledras street and on the boarder of Greek Cyprus towards the turkish part.Serving Greek dishes with a touch of Cyprus.Prices are good for some dishes, main huge dishes around 8€ but expensive for some other starters like 1.60€ for a cheese bite.",Kathodon
40,"Not being hugely hungry, we did not opt for the rather heavily marketed meze. All the small plates we chose instead were really good, with standouts being the prawn saganaki, the stuffed peppers and the divine kadaifi with honey and walnuts. Recommended.",Kathodon
50,Really nice restaurant)) we tried fish that perfect and some Greek salads. Staff was really nice to us as well.,Kathodon
50,"This place came recommended by a Greek friend of mine, and certainly did not disappoint. The oven baked lamb was fantastic! Others in our party ordered fish, kebab, and local Greek Cypriot dishes. It's a stone's throw from the border crossing to the Turkish area, which makes it a very convenient location.",Kathodon
50,Lovely meal made welcome by staff. Food was excellent. Busy restaurant looks like many locals use which is a good sign also on the main shopping street so very handy.,Kathodon
50,The best grilled octopus I have ever had!you must try it before you go home :)Friendly staff.reservation is necessary even in the evening.,Kathodon
50,"This tavern is perfect when you want to have a meze (many dishes in order to try lot of different food). Quality is perfect and is value for money, especially with the live greek music",Kathodon
40,"Saturday night and as expected extremely crowded. The food was very good, tasty and portions large. Good live music but given the small area and the number of people, it was very loud. It made talking impossible and was unable to hear the music properly as everyone was shouting in order to communicate with each other.And of course is the matter of smoking. Not unique to this establishment of course. Cypriots have a tender to ignoring laws. Smoking all around us, something that makes it very unpleasant.",Kathodon
30,"Visited the place multiple times. Good food, normal prices, live music, great fun and nice staff. Recommended",Kathodon
50,"Very nice food. Best quality, the staff is very friendly , helping and warm. The quality and the quantity of the food are more than enough. Actually you can't finish all your food. We had meat meze and it was really a lot of food. Nice music and great environment.",Kathodon
40,Food was amazing and service was good too. The staff is very helpful. We were there on day time on a week day so there was no music but i believe there is live music at weekends.,Kathodon
30,"Just nice because ,meze was plenty of dishes in small plates (two bites)but variety of tastes.i dont know how nice is this!!!the sausage and the smokes steak was very good an extra dishes of seftalia was the best plate in our table.The last plate (the sweet) halvas orange flavoured was ""overheated"" and i disappointed , it was like soap!Anyway good service ,midrange food a little bit touristic tastes, my opinion is that just a hungry cyprian could eat there!",Kathodon
50,"Just across the Turkish-Greek border (on the Greek side), you'll find this perfect place for lunch or dinner. The owner and the staff are really nice and I can fully recommend the mezzes: it's a Greek tapas style dish with delicious bites of food, we loved it. We'll certainly go here next time we're in Lefkosa/Nicosia, been there two times now and it's only getting better!",Kathodon
50,"Been here twice and will likely be back! Its located at the end of Ledras Street, things start to get busy around 8pm. Ordered the vegetarian mezze to share on the first trip, and the vegetarian plate on the second, both times with a large pint of Keo. Both times left overly full... because it was so good!",Kathodon
50,Best restaurant in old city Nicosia . good food good drink especially ouzo .great relaxing greek music .good staff help full i arrived late . it was out of grilled food . even so it was great,Kathodon
40,"Searching trip advisor for restaurants within easy walking distance of our hotel, Kathodon came up with good reviews. So, we booked on returning from the walking crossing on Ledra Street. Choices of eating in or out. Heaters and smoking outside so we opted for inside. We opted for a Fish Meze, against our principle of ""can't smell the sea so don't have the fish!"" However, this was brilliant and a steady stream of octopus, fish (sea bass, anchovies, sardines, whitebait) and calamari plus the usual dips and salad. Very good meal and a busy restaurant",Kathodon
40,"It was delicious! Huge plates, complimentary bread, liquor and desert from the restaurant and professional and helpful staff. I'm not entirely aware of the difference between Greek and Cypriot cuisine but the menu at Kathodon offered the best from the first and not the latter.",Kathodon
30,"Very good location close to the check point in Ledras street. The cleftikio ( baked lamb) was very good, but the mezze was average. The mezze hier has the advantage of being reasonable in size : you can finish it ! good service, highchairs for children.",Kathodon
40,"Hubby had grilled octopus, I had special lamb lefties, a lamb shank and potato wrapped in pastry paper and baked in oven. It was delicious, quite moist but wayyyy too much food for me. Liked the ambiance and location of the restaurant, last restaurant before the border! Easy to find since name kathodon nowhere to be found in English, only written in Greek. Many smokers in Cyprus so if you're adverse best not to sit on the patio, Not open enough this time for year for smoke to dissipate, great service. In all very nice evening. Would go back",Kathodon
50,Try the full mezze. Its incredible. You will taste greek dishes in a value price at a friendly atmosphere with live music. Good value for money. Better make a reservation as place gets very busy. Love it!,Kathodon
40,"All was great! We visited five times , and we enjoyed different disches from their menu , all was delicious. Thank you",Kathodon
30,"I've been here a few times trying to justify is popularity. No clue found. In Greece this would be an average of even bad restaurant. Small portions, over priced, and mediocre flavors. Sure if you haven't tried Greek food before..",Kathodon
30,"The food was good and the stay very welcoming but the plates were too small compared to the prices. The place looks traditional with Greek music and the atmosphere helps you feel the Greek culture but in a more ""touristy"" way. The location of the restaurant is next to the borders and that makes it more interesting.",Kathodon
50,"We regularly visit - food is always excellent - the owner is super fun and always accommodates our needs. Ideally book before going as its a busy place. They always offer free homemade dessert, another plus!",Kathodon
30,"Nice warm interesting looking decor. Large place so good for groups or families rather than an intimate romantic place for couples. Speciality Greek mezedes as in Greece. Interesting menu. In the end however, not so 'friendly' for a solo foreigner in wintertime!I had an ok large portion of tzatzki and horiatiki which arrived with an economical 4 black olives as decoration! I took it back to my hotel as it was too big for one. All portions in Greece and Cyprus are for two people, never one.I was offered complimentary halwa and mastica.",Kathodon
40,"A good place to try traditional food. I went several times with my family and friends. The mezze is a good choice, a big variety, good service and prices. Also there is live music!",Kathodon
50,This restaurant is right next to the border crossing on he southern side. Food is superb and so is the service. Dine any time. Recommend the meatballs and chicken kebab.,Kathodon
20,"Slow and inattentive service. I ordered a chicken souvlaki and was brought a pork souvlaki, which was slightly burnt and difficult to chew, the fries were tasteless and melted on the plate.The decoration is overwhelming (too much going on on the walls - photos and writing) and the live music is anything but professional and deafening. It doesn't make the eating experience any more pleasant.The only positive thing is that the prices more or less reflect the quality of the food.",Kathodon
20,"the place is right next to Lidra check point with thousands of people passing by. It looks like a food factory. Average food ,bud service Silly sayings and phrases written on the walls. There are a lot better places for lunch or dinner near by.",Kathodon
20,"Acceptable food quality, expensive, some non professionals trying to perform as singers, average service, not friendly waiters, all in all not worth visiting.",Kathodon
30,"Had our first dinner in the capital here after seeing it highlighted in the Lonely Planet.Busy with tourists and locals alike.Staff mostly friendly.It was difficult to get a table that was away from smokers.Plenty of choice on the menu of Greek traditional dishes as well as other staples. Meze options available but we didn't have on this occasion.Waiter good at advising on the menu.The recommended shish kebab with yoghurt was good, the diced lamb on skewer wasn't a great choice. Unfortunately Kleftiko was sold out but suspect would have been really good here.Portion sizes were good so we were full.Complimentary dessert and shot of mastic were a generous touch.Maybe it has a different feel in the busy summer months, but it lacked a bit of atmosphere.",Kathodon
40,We visited twice this week and had excellent food on both occasions! Their Kleftiko is very good as is the service.,Kathodon
40,"We've eaten here twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had calamari the first time, chicken the second, tried commanderia wine and the [free]mastic. Nice free pudding too: fruit and halva. Very helpful over our ignorance of Greek food. Very busy, nearly all Greek customers. They recognized us the second time, which was good. Will go back, though it's not the cheapest in town",Kathodon
20,I am really surprised it ranks so high. We were a big company (colleagues) and had the meze. Low quality fried stuff mostly.,Kathodon
40,"Really traditional place to taste greek food. You have a lot of choices but i would suggest to taste the ""maze"" menù (meat or fish), for 20 bucks you are going to eat a lot among several different good dishes. I really appreciate, I've been there two times and I'll come back again.",Kathodon
40,"Friendly staff, live music, reasonable prices. I had the mixed grill plater, food was tasteful but i would appreciate a bigger portion. Overall a nice place. 4*",Kathodon
30,Stayed in the old town Nicosia and went out to what we thought looked a good restaurant. We ordered starters and a main meal but they only brought out my wife's starter and after asking three different waiters to check on my starter it eventually arrived 10 minutes later by which time my wife had finished hers. Our mains consisted of lamb chops for my wife which were OK and mine which was a lamb kebab (3 skewers) which were tough and gristly.,Kathodon
20,it is a mixed cyprus and greek cuisine rather expensive but you can find it easy It is next to the check point at the main shopping street The music is good but you cannot dance not even move no space,Kathodon
10,"I have visited a lot of greek taverns in my life. I can't understand what is the big deal about Kathodon. All dips are not handmade (tzatziki, cheese salad etc). The food is nothing special and the place only takes advantage of its great location.",Kathodon
30,"Average prices, average food - only cheese with sesamee was a perfect bit. Chicken (fillet or spade) was good, lamb was unacceptable - burned rubber, unfortunatelly. Fresh vegetables.",Kathodon
40,"The food here is great and so is the ambiance, especially outside. But don't try to come here on a busy evening, as the staff attitude seems to run high.",Kathodon
40,"Located at the border crossing end of Ledra Street this restaurant comes with unusual local atmosphere. It is well placed to watch the people passing either way and using the crossing. It is also a place to go to eat! There is a wide choice and all that we chose we enjoyed - the grilled mushrooms were a treat. The house wine was fine. The ambience noisy, loud and fun!",Kathodon
40,"Kathodos is a well known place in Nicosia very close to the checkpoint. The food is mostly traditioal- Greek and has live Greek music. A hood place to go with friends to eat, drink and have a good time",Kathodon
40,"I have been to this restaurant several times. The food is of very good quality, most of it cooked on the charcoal or in the oven and is very tasty. There are several types of salads to choose from and they are all very fresh and tasty. It has a nice atmosphere and the live Greek music played by a guitarist who also sings a great variety of songs is a great plus.",Kathodon
50,"Seems more authentic and less tourist place than rest of places I visited. Tasty, good atmosphere; live music and friendly service.",Kathodon
50,"This is a traditional greek restaurant with very good and tasty meal, friendly manager and waiters and traditional greek music",Kathodon
40,"Called into Kathodon by off chance, and was pleasantly surprised with staff, choice of menu, often the house wine is nothing more than dish water, but pleased to say, most enjoyable. Traditional proper Cyprus/Greek food without all the batter that so often is coated with.",Kathodon
50,Simple and traditional Greek dishes done very well. The house wine and dish of the day were good value and delicious. The owner visited tables to ensure all was okay and only negative was The time it took the waiter to acknowledge us. Good food that met our expectations.,Kathodon
40,"I'd give this place 6 stars for service happily. The waiters were efficient and uber friendly and even the owner/manager came out to say hello too. There is live greek music which somehow is not distracting but is part of the Greekness of the place. Close your eyes, you'd think you where on a beach (and not next to the border crossing of this divided capital). Its not as 'trendy' as the some of the newer restaurants but more authentic somehow. The food is not bad, the chicken schnitzel is good, the chicken kebab ok, and the kleftiko very decent too. Try the meatballs of Smyrna-just for the nostalgia of it. I'ld definitely come again!",Kathodon
50,"Very authentic with traditional Greek music. Was a real pleasure to eat to such tradition and with such a setting. Right on the divided line that splits the city, it make it more special as it shows its sadness and happiness. Worth a visit for it's style to.",Kathodon
30,"The food is very delicious but as i have described it in the title is 'expensive'. What i mean by saying expensive : you order 'mezedes' for 2 people and you get 1 slice each food portion if not half slice each! If their portions were a bit larger i would not describe it as 'expensive'. However, it also has live music most of the times which makes it a happy place to eat 'mezedes'.",Kathodon
50,I was in one day trip in town so we went for lunch it is a simple restaurant they have night entertainment program at night the food is great traditional Mediterranean food The service was excellent big portion we enjoyed the experience,Kathodon
40,The food was very good. Because there were too many tables very close to one another it was very difficult to sit comfortably. The service was slow. They could not manage the orders properly. Its best to choose a day during the week instead of weekends.,Kathodon
50,The warm welcome of stuff was the first good impression. They made us feel like visiting their own home! Interior design is genuine Greek style and greek humour is printed on every wall! FOOD IS GREEK! AND PERFECT! WE LOVED IT! And great value for money! We definitely go again and we strongly recommend this restaurant!,Kathodon
40,We had lunch here and tried their meatballs (a special og the day). They were extremely tasty and good rice as side. Very attentive staff. Recommended.,Kathodon
40,Visited with a regular but the crowd says it all. Hugely popular and very enjoyable. Kleftiko was the special so we shared that with some mezze. Menu is wide and varied and in English as well as Greek. Quite touristy but a decent number of locals enjoying themselves and the music gives it a genuine feel.Food has improved since my last visit. Look forward to my next Cyprus trip and a revisit.,Kathodon
50,"Beautiful food all around. Picked some mezze from the menu. The smoked pork, spicy cheese and the the honey glazed feta were the highlights. However, we enjoyed everything from the menu. Albeit slightly louder, the live music contributed to the atmosphere of the place. Recommended!",Kathodon
30,"Mmm.. i used to visit this restaurant a lot cause i like the pedestrian area, the food was ok but the last 2 - 3 times we visited for lunch and dinner food was so average that we decided not to go there again...There is a nice atmosphere with music and friendly environment, service is ok but they need to focus on the food more. I would love to see fresh seafood well cooked, and focus on authentic cypriot cuisine (which is so good) and we will give it another try.",Kathodon
10,"Very salty chicken dish,starter missed off and to add insult to injury,Turkish coin in change,no point in arguing as usual.Never going back there.",Kathodon
50,"Kathodon has been in my favorite places to go in the past few years. I surely go there at least once a month. The food is amazing, fresh and cooked exactly to your liking. They also offer live greek music both at lunch and dinner. The staff is friendly but the service is not the best. When the place is full the food takes some time to be made but it's worth the waiting. All in all if you want to try greek cuisine this is one of your best choices.",Kathodon
50,"A superb greek tavern with a variety of meze dishes and foods at reasonable prices. had the ""kotsi"" and was delicious",Kathodon
50,Just before the crossing to Turkish occupied areas this restaurant stands there to remind of what Greek cuisine is all about. Excellent tastes & staff. Don't miss it,Kathodon
50,"Stopped off for lunch with my son, last restaurant before the crossing in to the Turkish occupied areas.Looked very traditional, on the day we visited there was a singer who blended in with the ambiance not to loud but loud enough to be able to appreciate the ambiance.Has Pork and Chicken SouvlakiOverall meal was excellent with good service and a reasonable price,Justified to be in the top 10 restaurants in NicosiaWill definatley visit again.",Kathodon
30,"A nice restuarant near the Ledras check point crossing over the turkish side.A very good ambience and an extensive greek menu. Prices are on the high if you choose mezze (small plates). For an adult and a child with 2 bottles of water, a greek salad, 4 cheese bites, chips, eggplant imam, fried zucchini + 2 meat sticks (soutzoukakia) cost us 35eur.",Kathodon
50,"We dropped by here for a bite with our Cypriot friend who recommended the place. We told him we wanted somewhere traditional and to sample traditional delights. We definately weren't disappointed. The buzz outside and around was great. The staff very attentive. Upon recommendation we plumped for the meat mezze. When it arrived we began to think we'd still be hungry at the end. However the chirpy waiter must have forgotten to stop bringing us food. It was a slow (slow enough to digest and enjoy) and constant supply. All of which tasted deliciously fresh and tasty. The top and bottom is we couldn't finish all that was put in front of us but hey, Who eats salad anyway. Jokes aside. Get yourself in here. It's a lovely place to sample local delights and will leave you feeling very satisfied. The prices seemed incredibly reasonable too.",Kathodon
50,"I jumped in this restaurant because it was the last restaurant right before I cross the green line. I somehow wanted to have something to eat before crossing it. Yes it is located right next to the cross point, you won't miss it. Honestly, I was a bit sceptical because it is located just in front of the check point, I wasn't expecting the quality but it turned out to be excellent.I ordered sausage-like but the name is not really sausage. Said that, it looks black sausage and slightly spicy. So delicious.As there were not enough staff when I dined, service wasn't speedy but I could be patient considering the situation.Probably there is a live music performance ? I saw music instrument setting inside of the restaurant.The sausage-like: 4 euroGlass wine: 3 euroIt is not so bad :)",Kathodon
40,Nice restaurant close to the green line crossing point in Nicosia. Manager very welcoming and friendly. Extensive menu and lots of specials. We had a Greek salad and kebabs both excellent and very reasonably priced.,Kathodon
30,"The food was nothing special, just typical Cyprus taverna food. Some days of the week they have live music and you need reservations.",Kathodon
50,"very nice restaurant, went there twice in two days, amazing food and ambiance, the waitress is so friendly. the singer was so enthusiastic and friendly too. i'd go there everyday without complaining! their special lamb dish was amazing! i had a tasty local wine too.a must visit for every tourist in nicosia",Kathodon
30,"We ordered meze for 2. It was tasty as before, but it is too small now. Enough right for 2 persons. Before we ordered same meze and couldn't finish it, this is what you can expect from all cyprus tavernas. Paid about 50 eur for 2 - 2 meze, water and cola. Will not go again.",Kathodon
40,friday night. greek food.good food.lovely atmosphere. good music. people were having fun. i would recommend everyone to try this place :),Kathodon
40,Always good food a very friendly service. Live music often and interesting decor inside. Very welcoming and great location on pedestrian street very close to Ledra Street crossing point.,Kathodon
50,Very friendly and genuine staff. Good food and Greek entertainment. Very well located in Nicosia. Definitely worth a visit!!,Kathodon
40,"Based on other recommendations we walked until we found it! We were looking for an authentic Cypriot experience.A warm, friendly greeting awaited us at the entrance.Rustic furniture, very traditional taverna style.We settled for the meat Meze. From the first mouthful until the last, it was all tasty. We sampled at least 16 different types of food. My husband was in a food coma!The balalaika music was very pleasant.",Kathodon
30,Nice place and not bad food. The service was a little delayed but attentive.Not the best place that I have visited but it was also not the worst.The prices were a little high for what was served.The place was cozy and pleasant atmosphere.,Kathodon
50,"You are in Nicosia, in pedestrian streets zone. You are looking for a tasty food, at a good price, in a space that reminds an island. Besides, you are on an island! Then, you see in front of your eyes Kath' Odon greek restaurant! A space which reminds greek island, with a great food, very nice prices, cool staff and the most perfect owner - director that could have! Just look for Mr. Sakis!",Kathodon
50,"Excellent food quality, authentic Greek cousin with supreme tastes, and good service are fair comments. A place to eat authentic Greek (and Cypriot) lentils recipes, beyond its commonly served meet and fish. Fresh juices are fantastic. Live guitar is also a plus.",Kathodon
40,Cozy greek restaurant just nearby the occupation line in Nicosia.Sittings inside and out side with pleanty of heaters.Prompt staff.Prices reasonable especialy for good greek wine.Most plates are fresh and tasty.Be careful of meet. Last time was overcooked and not fresh.Live music on . Always full.,Kathodon
40,Got today for lunch and the place was wonderful. Clean and tasty lunch but a bit crowded. Smiley personnel and good manager. Will be visited soon again!,Kathodon
50,"We went for dinner after coming back from the crossing point. I was worried it might be rubbish as on the tourist trail. The meal was lovely and not too badly priced although a little inflated due to the location.We had a slight issue over the fact there is no children's menu. I asked for a child's spaghetti for my 3 year old and got one that would have fed all of us. On pointing this out they did reduce the size of it for her. When the bill came we were only charged for half which, was a pleasant surprise.On the whole a nice place, good food, atmosphere and clean toilets.",Kathodon
50,I have been here a number of times but when I first came to Nicosia and was wondering round on my own I went there for lunch and liked it so much I insisted we went back there that evening with my colleagues.The portions are huge so make sure you are hungry when you go there.All the staff are very friendly and there is a warm inside eating area for when it's too cold to eat outside and people watch.,Kathodon
40,"Visited this restaurant by chance for late lunch, but was impressed by the food. It serves a Greek meze with dishes from all round Greece and its islands. Everything is delicious and nicely presented. Will definitely go again.",Kathodon
30,Average quality food. Service not that bad. If you think that it is on an excellent location they should be serving better food and the prices should be better. They have to reorganize the whole experience.,Kathodon
20,The meze dishes were insufficient compared to the price. The drinks were also overpriced and the service was poor!,Kathodon
30,"Visited place after the recommendation of some friends one Sunday early afternoon.Place is too crowd and tables are very closed each other thus you feel that you are sitting together with the table next to you.There is a huge menu and you can choice from a big variety of meat, fish or veggie dishes most of them cooked in a Greek way.Unfo whatever we have tried had average taste and quantities of the dishes were very small.Last but not least we were waiting for 25 minutes in order to give us a table as restaurant was full even if we were advised that in 10 minutes table will be available.",Kathodon
40,We had live Greek music at that evening. Home style cooked Greek food. Happy and noisy ambiance. Lots of Zivania shots. Spontaneous dancing guests. Informal service. Happy happy.,Kathodon
50,Regular visitors to this traditional Greek restaurant which is always busy. Wide selection of Greek tasty dishes. Had lunch there with friends. It was very pleasant to listen to a singer playing old Greek songs on the guitar. Always happy to go back.,Kathodon
40,"We had a very nice meal in Kathadon- we were especially happy as they had a nice choice of non-grilled traditional Greek home-style dishes. Very good location, in Ledra street, close to the crossing point.",Kathodon
10,"Ordered meze but quantity was very small for the price. 2 persons paid €37 for 2 meze and 1 beer but no value for money.Almost no actual meat in dishes. ie tiny slice of sausage each, small pork filet, meat skewer. Pretty much this.Service was good, although cold to sit outside. Couldn't take off our jackets.Too much disappointed. Was tasty but never never again. People should explore their options out there.",Kathodon
50,"This restaurant provides a large variety of good Greek food, as opposed to Cypriot, although some dishes can arguably be similar. As a family gathering we ordered maze which arrived quickly and regularly. These included, feta in pastry fried, potato balls, mixed range of dips, variety of meat on skewers such as pork, lamb.........overall the quality was excellent as indicative of the fullness of the restaurant. As an additional offering a Greek singer and guitarist that was brilliant to the extent that many joined in singing and even dancing in the restaurant. A day to remember. But make sure you book!",Kathodon
50,"I visited last month for a friends Birthday. I have to say the food and service are excellent. You should try their souvlaki, loukaniko and souvla and there are also many more exceptionally made dishes. Order them as a meze.",Kathodon
20,I tried their meze and i was very disappointed considering comments I heard from other people. Its a weird mix of Greek and Cypriot kitchen also the flow of dishes was slow. The live music that was on was very nice though,Kathodon
50,"My husband and I dined at Kathodon three out of five nights of our stay in Cyprus. The food is excellent, prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is friendly. I would recommend this restaurant hands down!",Kathodon
40,"We went there on a Sunday, but we had to make a reservation since a lot of people were waiting in line to eat there without one. It was a bit crowded because many families go and have lunch or dinner there, but it was worth it. A man was playing music with his guitar creating a calming atmosphere. I totally recommend it!",Kathodon
40,"We had our lunch yesterday, not disappointed, but the flow of dishes was somewhat slow, assuming that we ordered between shifts, I can understand that but definitely not an excuse, the owner, friendly as usual, showed up later for a hello and if all is ok question, that mended the trickling of dishes a bit...",Kathodon
40,"This restaurant is a lovely place to sit inside because the walls are covered in unusual pictures and other interesting things to look at, while you enjoy a very tasty meal.the lamb chops are delicious. The staff are friendly and the cost of the meals is very reasonable",Kathodon
50,"I only came to Kathodon by accident - I meant to go to a restaurant across the street but it was closed. I'd thought Kathodon looked a bit large and unfriendly - how wrong could I be?Although the menu was reasonably extensive, I chose one of the specials - lamb fricassee, done in a local style with eggs and lemon. It was absolutely fabulous! The lemon (I'd wondered how that would work with lamb) was very subtle and the lamb was so tender, it just fell apart on the fork. There was a green leaf vegetable of some sort - spinach? - also in the mix, giving a slightly darker tinge to the flavour.Not expensive - just €9 for the meal and €5.50 for a half litre of the local wine.I'll definitely be back...",Kathodon
50,"This was our second visit to this excellent local restaurant in Nicosia. Service was good, the food was delicious-my kebab was fantastic-and it was full of locals. The wine flowed.",Kathodon
40,"The food was excellent, the service was very good and the decor of the shop inside has a lot of character. However if you decide to sit outside like we did, the sitting area is surrounded by unattractive glass fences and you run the danger of sitting next to a chain smoker. Also the quality of the speakers was not good at all and the music too loud. We were a company of 4 and we could not hear each other talking so we left as soon as we ate. However I should mention that the music and the band were very good.",Kathodon
40,"You cannot miss this place if you sightsee the old town. It's located near the Ledras Street Gate to the occupied territories. It doesn't look much forum outside but the food is great. Superb Greek live music from 8:30 pm completes the place. Meze, good fish, souvlaki, amazing local wines and jot only. Make a reservation for dinner if you want outdoor seating but not only...",Kathodon
50,It is a very nice restaurant with a strong local flavor at the end of Ledra street (A very nice pedestrian street to walk through before or after). The food is lovely and PLENTY to say the least. Wine is good. Music is wonderful! Highly recommended.,Kathodon
50,"This restaurant, located near the Ledra Street crossing point, is definitely worth a visit. It's a lively restaurant, with live music and friendly staff. I chose it because it looked like there were a lot of locals eating there in large parties. The food is fresh and delicious, and plentiful! Highly recommended.",Kathodon
50,"Very nice food, just in time, no delays and very delicious, the employees were very friendly people and the owner too!! The music was very nice! Just Perfect!!!!!",Kathodon
50,"We had both the fish and the vegetarian mezzes on different days and each was terrific and more than you can eat!The location is perfect on the pedestrian Ledra street just at the end before the passport controls.Each time the restaurant was packed and it looked like we were unlucky but they found a way to give us a table and better yet on the lovely outside terrace to people watch. It's not expensive and not touristy, clients are many Greek. Once again the quality of the food and service was the best!",Kathodon
40,"Good location very close to the Ledra Street crossing. My husband had the Kathodon Burger, which is less of a burger (no bun), more of a huge pork patty crammed with melted cheese - we thought feta and perhaps kefalotyri - and was delicious. I had the Shish Kebab Giaourtlou - I had no idea what it was, but saw it being brought to another table and it looked tasty, so I tried it. It turned out to be lamb kebabs on pita, with tomatoes and yoghurt, and was very good. We had an aubergine salad (more of a dip) to accompany the meals. With a soft drink and beer, the bill came to €28 which was good value for a city centre restaurant.",Kathodon
30,"moderate food however they serve too many similar dishes, prices moderate , music loud , service good",Kathodon
40,"Been there for mother's birthday a long time ago, but visited it at least 5 times, since both food and live music where very nice.",Kathodon
10,"we ordered halloumi salad - it's only halloumi and SALAD - no tomatoes cucumber etc?! Second dish - lamb in wine - terrible meat, hard to feel wine in the sous. NOT RECOMMENDED!",Kathodon
40,Very friendly and busy restaurant on the main street near the crossing point. We shared the meat meze which was a good selection and filling. Good choice of drinks. Recommended.,Kathodon
40,Very good food and nice live music for company. Unlike other places the music its not so loud and noisy.,Kathodon
50,Amazing Greek food in the heart of Nicosia. I recommend it but definitely better to book one before going there for dinner. some times they have live music.,Kathodon
40,"The restaurant is on the busy Ledra, Nicosia's main street. The food is typical of Cyprus: many mezes (appetizers), well prepared fish, lamb and other local specialties. The wine is ordinary, cheap but drinkable. Service is superb, the owner is always present supervising the staff. There is usually a duo performing Greek and European tunes starting at 9 pm. Over all a pleasant place to dine and enjoy the evening with many locals.",Kathodon
50,"The food is fresh and delicious and the atmosphere is very welcoming.After spending a few hours in Northern Nicosia, we crossed the Ledra Street frontier and stumbled upon this restaurant for Sunday lunch.It provides good value with many traditional Cypriot dishes cooked to order with fresh produce.",Kathodon
50,"We went to eat here on a very vibrant sunny saturday in february - merely following the great smells that came into our nose, and noticing a lot of locals also populated the restaurant.We got served in a very friendly and swift manner. After some basic starters the main courses were top notch: excellent grilled fish caught that morning, some of the better kleftiko I've had so far,The place was buzzing - as was much of Lefkosia that weekend - which combined with the great food and lovely weather made for a great lunch.To sum it up: great food and products, excellent location (center of Lefkosia, near the crossing in Lidras), swift service!",Kathodon
50,"One of the best greek restaurants on the island a big variety of Greek delicacies, mouth watering dishes that you will have to choose from a menue written with a twist of humor, you will like it...",Kathodon
40,"The restaurant is located closed at the end of Ledra's street, very closed to the check point. Fresh salads, well prepared dishes, reasonable price, friendly staff.",Kathodon
50,"We visited Kathodon based on its Trip Advisor reviews and its close proximity to the Ledra Street crossing. We were not disappointed.Situated about 50m away from the crossing we visited as a family for Saturday lunch.The restaurant has a large outside seating area with numerous fans to aid air circulation in the hot summer months and an in door air conditioned area wonderfully decorated with old pictures and photographs. Both areas were exceptionally clean and well presented.We ate outside which also offers the opportunity to watch the world go by and adds to the experience.The menu is extensive and offers a wonderful selection of Cypriot dishes. It also contains a lovely introduction detailing why Kathodon is called that and has a number of quotes that made us smile.The food was brilliant. Everyone of our party commented on how good it was and the liver that I had was superbly cooked. Probably some of the best food we have had in Cyprus this year. The Cypriot wine was served in metal carafes which contributed to Kathodon's charm.Service was also excellent, friendly, attentive and welcoming and we were able to relax and while away a lovely Saturday lunch without feeling any pressure.Pricing was extremely good and there seemed to be no premium due its location near the crossing.One that is exceptionally easy to recommend. Excellent on so many different levels and one that we shall return to on our next visit to Lefkosia.",Kathodon
50,"We keep going at Sakis as food is always tasty, traditional Greek plates, good live Greek-music, quick service and homely atmosphere.This evening we tried Kleftico served with oven-potatos, a big tasty pork-chop with fried potatos, Greek tomato salad with onions and fetta-cheese and a big Keo Beer at the total price of 27.80 euros. They offered us small pieces of Greek halva as dessert. This place is recommended by us.",Kathodon
40,"Desperately looking for somewhere to take my guests, I was pleased that there was availability at this restaurant as I had heard a lot of good things about it. We were given a table inside, which was good as there was air conditioning and made the hot evening more comfortable.. It's decorated in a quirky humourous way with Greek photos, pictures reflecting the Greek mainland . There was live Greek music giving a lovely atmosphere to the evening. The menu itself, was interesting offering the usual Greek appetizers and main meals such as tzanztiki, tirokafteri, soulvakia, kleftikon etc. but also offering so many other no so usual dishes. The portions were big, and each meal was served exactly how we asked for. An aperitif, fruit and dessert were offered on the house to everyone which was a nice end to our meal. The service was excellent. And the final bill was extremely reasonable for four people. I wouldn't hesitate to go again.",Kathodon
30,"Variety of foid choice the tradituonal greek way at the end of Ledra street at the symbolic check point of Ledra street. Although good service and music, certain food choices as oart of the meze or separately chosen are frozen importef from Greece and home fried...not acceptable nowadays.",Kathodon
40,We went there last night and really enjoyed it! Loved the food and the live music! Staff was really nice but service was a bit slow..! But in general we had a wonderful time and i totally recommend it!!!,Kathodon
50,I do not now from where to start Everything was excellent from the food to the service to tge music Food and service was excellent and we was lucky it was live music and we had a great time thanks,Kathodon
20,"its a cosy area and place but food is average, music depends on taste some find it nice some noisy, outside sitting better for a beer instead of a meal",Kathodon
40,"This restaurant is situated within the old town of Nicosia, at the end of the shopping street called Ledra. Despite the fact that we did not reserve and the place was full, the staff managed to find a table for us (6 friends). We ordered various Greek dishes, including souvlaki and they were all greatly cooked and tasted fine. The service was excellent and they were there for us in whatever we requested. I can say that the prices were reasonable and it was very good value for money.",Kathodon
40,"The old city of Nicosia, unlike much of the rest of the city, is undergoing a revival with trendy new shops and restaurants opening frequently. This is quite a change from when I visited Nicosia eighteen months ago. Friends took me to Kathodon, a very lively restaurant located in the old city on a pedestrian only street. Owned by two young Greek Cypriots, the restaurant is a great place to sample local cuisine and night life. It was a warm evening so we sat outside along with many other diners. The cuisine is typically Greek but the salads, kebobs and souvlaki are well prepared and plentiful. The local wines are quite good and reasonably priced. We had an excellent Cypriot red with our meal. The staff are friendly and attentive and the prices for what we ordered quite reasonable. Great ambience and we plan to return when next we are in Cyprus.",Kathodon
40,"Unique atmosphere, live greek classics music. Bit noisy and very busy Sunday lunch. Efficient albeit hasty service. Huge selection of Greek and Cypriot dishes. Starters very good, mains (meats) a disappointment. Would like to give it another shot on a less busy day.",Kathodon
50,"I had dinner in Kathodon. Because of the nice weather, I could sit outside. A guitarist played life music. Great food, warm welcome. Professional waiters.",Kathodon
50,"We only had a short time in Nicosia, which was a real shame as we really enjoyed our lunch here and would have liked to linger longer over lunch - it is in a good spot for people watching. The service was quick, didn't have to wait long for menu, drinks or food and the waiter was friendly. The food was great; in particular my partner had a lamb dish which was just lovely. Would go back.",Kathodon
40,"This was one of the first places we eaten in this country. And then we thought it was pretty cool, the 2 portions of meze was way too much for 3 girls. But right now I am not so sure if i will come back, despite the fact the place was clean and staff was relly good.",Kathodon
50,"I had an awesome lamb lunch at Kathodon! Every bite of the lamb and potatoes was just so very tasty ... I've never had lamb so good. I liked the resaurant not only for the food but for it's location on the ""border"" with the Turkish-controled part of Nicosia ... I could watch the comings and goings. If you go to Kathodon, get the lamb.",Kathodon
30,"like the song ... ""Somebody that i used to know .. "" ..I went a few times at Kathodon restaurant. On the first I got exited as it was something different in Nicosia. After a couple of visits you will found out that it's not so Wow after all ..The decoration and overall place look it's very nice and that's a must to help you plan a visit. If you go at night time, make sure to were your earplugs, no offence to the singer (there is a live music), but the music it's too loud while trying to eat. For the food we tried once again the Meze. At my opinion I think it could be better if they avoid the oily and hard to digest foods.Anyway, my opinion now is that it's an average restaurant worth to visit.",Kathodon
50,"A must culinary experience you need to have while in old Nicosia town. With original greek cuisine with a touch of cyprus, its an experience you need to enjoy. Recommend reservation. Love it!",Kathodon
40,typical Greek tavern with satisfying and tasty portions. some days with live music. very friendly stuff.,Kathodon
30,"I think they should really rethink their menu, really average food if not less...If it wasnt for the location i think they dont have anything special for people tocome for. Service is slow and i dont think its value for money either, probably not a choicefor me again",Kathodon
30,Good food but overpriced for what you get in return. Sorry to say but I dont think will be going there again...,Kathodon
40,"kathodon is a typical Greek taverna. The food is good as well the portions. The owner was there every time I visit and he runs the place smoothly. We are returning customers, as well as other friends that we know.",Kathodon
50,You have to try the Meze. Real quality food with great variety. Recipes are out of the ordinary making every dish an unexpected but pleasant surprise. A definite must for anyone visiting Ledras street in Nicosia.,Kathodon
40,"The place is nicely decorated and service was very good. For main courses we had the recommended traditional ones which were available on the day, owen cooked lamb and chicken & mushroom pancake with cream. They were excellent at a very good price. However, starters were good (chese fried balls and eggplant salad), but fish roe were disappointing. Also, I had a glass of red wine which was not good at all and the bread was dry and hardened when it cooled as if heated in the microwaves. They offered complimentary local desert and mastic. Overall it was very good and the price was really low.",Kathodon
40,"Very good greek food, large and delicious portions...Very good atmosphere, staff are polite and very efficient. They are willing to explain the menu, to recommend the meal of the day and to have a little chat with you as long as you wish... One of the best restaurants in Cyprus.",Kathodon
20,"I really don't understand how this place can be one of the top restaurants in Nicosia. I would classify this restaurant more of a tourist trap, mainly because of its location. Its location is really good, at the end of Ledras str.The food is mediocre (we tried their meze menu) and honestly there is nothing special about it. The quality of the ingredients is average. The food is based on Greek cuisine (not Cypriot).Atmosphere is ok, you really feel that you are in a tavern, and it has live music every night.However, the biggest problem of this restaurant is its service. Been there on a Thursday night(not so busy) and the waitresses were not able to serve all the tables on time. There was only one lady that was trying to do whatever was possible but the rest of restaurant's team was well below average.",Kathodon
40,"Its a family favorite for years and they never let you down. Try the meatballs, the pork chops. Most dishes are great and tasty. They are also fresh and light. Only problem is their chicken souvlaki it always felt dry. If you go on weekends you get live solo singer who also sings quite loudly some nights. but book in advance and avoid weekends if you dont like crowded places.",Kathodon
40,"Great place for lunch and dinner. Sunday brunch too. Greek food, tasty and tasteful. Friendly and efficient service. Reserve a table well in advance as the restaurant is almost always full.",Kathodon
50,I tasted meat mezze - meals were very good quality and rich tastes!! Not to mention the tranquility and hospitality of the boss:))),Kathodon
40,"We went there for lunch on Sunday. The place was packed, which is almost always a good sign. The portions were huge and cheap and the service was good, even though our waiter did not speak much English. The menu says that they ""don't serve impatient and nervous people,"" but nonetheless the food arrived pretty fast. I really loved their enormous juicy pork chops and the cheese balls. The lamb liver was also good. The meatballs in tomato sauce not so much.",Kathodon
40,Lovely casual Greek restaurant with decent Greek food. Worth a visit if you are walking around the old town.,Kathodon
40,"We have visited Kathodon last month after a couple of years of absence. We liked the service, food was tasty ( much better than our last visit). try the tenderloin steak with the fresh salads with it.",Kathodon
10,"We live in Cyprus nd visit Nicosia often. Had a pint n half here and was €8! Very expensive. When I asked why they said ""It's our tourist rates"". Not impressed and wouldn't go back. Use the small bar opposite for a fair price.",Kathodon
40,Tried this restaurant twice after looking for typical food in the center of Nicosia. The single plates were huge and very tasty (we tried oven baked sea bream and kleftiko). The next time we tried the meat mezze and it was amazing with so many tasty dishes that we ate far too much. Pricewise it was quite cheap for the amount of food served. The waiters were very nice and helpful!,Kathodon
50,A great place to enjoy Cyprus food and people!The place is right next to the green line in the old city of Nicosia. The service is just wonderful and the food is very autentic and yummy! If you ever find yourself in Nicosia I highly recommend you visit that place and try the kanaluni!,Kathodon
40,I have visited the place several times and I will visit it many mores to come. It serves good Greek meze always with the company of live music. Good service and quick. I prefer visiting the restaurant during the winter as I find the inner houce very warm and welcome but also sitting outside during the summer is also nice.,Kathodon
40,"It is a traditional Greek ""meze"" restaurant located on the main street in the old center of Nicosia. The service was attentive and friendly, and the food was fresh and tasty. We especially liked the ""horta"" (steamed or boiled greens), tzatziki, giant beans, and zucchini fritters. There were many different kinds of meat dishes, too. In nice weather it's a good location to sit outside and watch local people and tourists walk by. We ate there four times during a two-week stay.",Kathodon
50,The owner has a wonderful sense of humour and will take time to chat with his clients. He takes care to keep everyone happy.He did a wonderful job with his original decoration of the restaurant where you take your time to read everything ....The menu is that of a typical greek tavern but the taste is excellent !,Kathodon
20,"Food quality is below average, was not exactly fresh or tasty. service is acceptable, location is good, perhaps a good place for a drink in a nice area of Ledra.",Kathodon
40,A good tavern in the center of Nicosia. We ordered some meat plates and home wine.overall the food was good but I think that they have to reduce the prices.4 people 90 euro for actually nothing too special.,Kathodon
50,"Recently I took some friends for lunch at this restaurant located near the green line in Nicosia. The staff was extremely friendly and the service excellent. The food was beyond our expectations, beautifuly presented and tasty. Highly recommended if you happen to be in Nicosia. In the evenings they also have live music!!!",Kathodon
50,"I really like the place, at the end of Ledra street, just before the check point and the occupied area of Nicosia (the only divided capital in Europe)! The food is always delicious and the owner and staff are very welcome! Always busy place for so many reasons! A lovely place to go with friends or family!",Kathodon
50,We were warmly welcomed by all staff that served us especially Jiorgo. He recommended the excellent fish mezze and ouzo to drink with it. Unfortunately we could not finish it due to so much food being given to us!! Restaurant full with locals which is always a good sign.,Kathodon
40,"It's always a good sign when a taverna is busy with locals. We just managed to get a table at 1030 on a Saturday night. The maître d' or owner (we weren't sure which) was very friendly and happy to talk us through the menu. It's also a good sign when you are discouraged from over-ordering; I always feel more warmly about a place which has its clients' interests at heart and which resists the temptation to grab all the money it can.The food was good. Straightforward, well prepared taverna food. We particularly enjoyed the afelia (pork in red wine with coriander) and seftalia (offal sausages). The latter was a recommendation and well worth trying - I would definitely re-order if visiting again.Pricing was equally fair, with the bill for dinner for two coming in at less than €30.No hesitation in recommending this place to someone looking for a taverna meal and we would certainly go back again if we were looking for a safe bet.",Kathodon
50,"After a beautiful wedding 15 minutes away, my wedding party and I arrived to a warm and congratulatory reception at Kathadon! Nothing was too much trouble and the staff were attentive, jovial and accommodating. They even popped a 'Just Married' sign at the head of our table! The food and drink was delicious, plentiful and first class and the singer was perfect for our event and a great addition to the restaurant. I even got up and sang a song with one of my guests and enjoyed smashing a plate too! We all loved it; we were moved by the story of the owner and captivated by the messages and photos inside. A wonderful place! Thank you, Kathadon - although we live in London and were only in Cyprus for two and a half weeks, places like Kathadon make us feel that we can't wait to go back!!",Kathodon
40,"My family and I had agreed to meet from both sides of the island in central Nicosia for a chat and a catch up over a meal. We walked around looking for somewhere less on the beaten track on the assumption that such an eatery might be 'better'. However we quickly learned that on a Sunday at 17:00, lots of places were either closed, or not open yet, In the end we sat down at Kathodon, which is about as close to the border crossing on the Main Street as it is possible to get. With a sense of 'could we have done better' we sat outside, and were engaged in a very friendly way by the staff. The four of us agreed on a fish mezze and a meat mezze and we discovered that our choice was the gift that just keeps on giving. The quality of the food and dips that arrived on a seemingly never ending basis was amazing and we left the place waddling, rather than walking! The toilets inside we're the cleanest I have ever experienced in an eatery of this sort and the menu is humorously written. We'd all definitely eat there again.",Kathodon
40,"Service was nice, portions were good, pricing fair. The food quality was very good. A typical Greek tavern that respects its customers.",Kathodon
50,"Excellent food & flavor so delicious , service specialy with Elias I advice to visit it's great restaurant",Kathodon
50,"a typical friendly Mediterranean atmosphere in the middle of Nicosia. The decor of the restaurant sets the scene, the people who run the place are just lovely, friendly and so helpful. There was live Greek music when we were there. We asked for meze... and the food kept coming and coming and coming - until we told them to stop cos we could not have anymore. it was all amazingly good. it was a fantastic night, and the highlight of my visit to the city",Kathodon
40,The food is not something special i mean for the prices the food is not so good very expensive the only i like much is the fetta with susame,Kathodon
50,"This restaurant is a must go for any visitor to Nicosia....After strolling around old Nicosia this is the place to relax and enjoy a splendid meal.I liked the note on the menu saying that they do not serve customers who are on a hurry...!The food is just exquisite, and plentiful for what you pay..great value and great taste...",Kathodon
50,"Just a few metres from the Turkish border in the heart of Nicosia is the best traditional Greek restaurant I have ever visited. Kathodon was recommended to us by Ahmed, who works at the nearby Centrum Hotel, and it was the perfect suggestion for my wife and I. Right after we grabbed our seats, we were greeted by our waiter George, who made us feel at home instantly. It was actually our first dinner out during our visit to Cyprus so we were ready for anything. I was taken aback and immediately impressed when George simply asked, ""Are you very hungry?"" and after we nodded, he just snatched up our menus and confidently said, ""I'll take care of it"" and made a bee line back to the kitchen. I felt like I was at George's house as he took care of us and explained what each dish was and its traditional connection to the Greek Cypriot culture. The other servers were also very informative and inviting. The chef came to our table later on to check on our food and of course, it was incredible.PROS:- great location right in the middle of Nicosia and easy to walk to- excellent wait staff, including my main man George, who took great care of us- terrific atmosphere- food was delicious as you could tell it was valued by the locals- great prices for amazing value- Former US president Bill Klinton (sic) visited a few years back and there is a framed photo of this momentous occasion inside the restaurantCONS:- None. This place was fabulous. Best restaurant we visited during our seven days in CyprusWHAT WE ORDERED (a feast for two 'hungry' people):- Nepo Megalo small plate (2.20 Euro)- Melitzano Salata small plate (3.50 Euro)- Mpougiournti small plate (5 Euro)- Kolokythakia Tra small plate (4.50 Euros)- Kommatia small plate (4.20 Euros)- Ofion Kleftiko entree (10 Euros) **highly recommend this, roasted lamb comes in a parchment paper bag with steamed potatoes and spices with lemon**- craft of Kanata white wine (8.20 Euro)- (2) espresso (6 Euro)- Total: 43.60 Euro",Kathodon
40,"It is a very good restaurant, with excellent greek food and kind atmosphere. The service is great and I was very confort there. Thank you for your service!",Kathodon
40,"Visited our first night in Cyprus after being away for over 5 years. It was an adequate meal but by no means overwhelming. Service was excellent, portions of meze for 2 were just fine, pricing was fair enough. The downside for us was the quality of meat served - all cuts seemed quite tough - from the pork souvlaki, the pork chop itself was mostly fat, the lamb liver was ...well liver...no chicken on offer tonight. The portion of olives served was minimal as well. (I think we had 4 in total for all the dishes) - I like olives....That said the house red wine was excellent. 19 euro per person (no desert but offered a digestive which was good )",Kathodon
50,we were at here at lunch time. Really liked the place. Waitress Marina helped us with the menu. we had a very nice meal.And a good time spent)),Kathodon
40,"Have eaten here several times and the quality is always great. The staff are okay but a few don't speak great English. Of course this isn't expected but it's worth noting if you wouldn't be comfortable with this. I disagree that the food is overpriced - the portions are very reasonable and compared to most Nicosia restaurants, it is cheaper. The drinks are also cheap, especially compared to the up to €4 charged for a soft drink in some Nicosia hotels. I would also like to recommend the Moussaka dish to anyone looking for a great dish without wanting to head straight in to the deep end of trying the weird world of Greek cuisine.",Kathodon
50,"this place is full of atmosphere and great food. the owner has taken a lot of tender loving care over the décor and the food is Greek/Anatolian in flavour. mouthwatering dishes kept arriving on our table, a feast for the eyes and stomach. the grilled pork chop was the tenderest I have ever tasted. There is only one musician playing guitar but he had a wide Greek repertoire and is not overbearing so you can still converse with your friends, which was nice. Well done, would gladly go again.",Kathodon
40,"It's one of our favorite places to eat in old Nicosia. It's a great place but a bit overpriced, keeping in mind the current financial situation.",Kathodon
40,"Good restaurant that kept its reputation for many years as it has its own unique character, combines both food and good music.",Kathodon
30,"It used to be one of my favourites for Greek/local food. Over time it has become slack on service, food is OK, bit on the greasy side but grilled choices are still good. My main complaint is that it is overpriced for what you are getting. When a place becomes popular with tourist they seem to think that there standards can come down. Its a nice location, just watch the world go by, I would still go for a drink but with a wider choice of places to eat its not on the top of my list.",Kathodon
50,"Recommended by a friend, we tried this restaurant and were not disappointed. Excellent choice of authentic local dishes, good sized portions, attentive staff, unobtrusive live music, reasonable prices, a first class restaurant experience.",Kathodon
50,"We will continue visiting the place as the food is always amazing ! Delicious Cyprus & Greek plates, really authentic and tasty food, in a very pleasant atmosphere with Harris and his quitar in Greek live music. Try spagetti with shrimps, fried cuttlefish, kleftiko, or take the meze, too much food but worthwhile.Good service and reasonable prices. Sakis the owner friendly and polite as always. Highly reccomended !!!",Kathodon
50,Great menuFriendly StaffV.good portionsPurely Greek(Must try the Mastiha Liquor)A bit expensive compared to other restaurants,Kathodon
40,"The restaurant was located just in front of the boundary between South and North Cyprus. The restaurant was full of the tourists, but our original expectation to the meals were not so high because of its very good location. However, the tastes of fried calamari and tarama dip were actually good even for us who are used to having those typical Greek food, and the prices of them were more reasonable than that in Limassol. Although the quality of wine we had tried was poor. This restaurant is good to visit.",Kathodon
40,"A pleasant environment to finish a stroll in the old part of Nicosia (Ledras - Faneromenis - Onasagorou streets). The food is good and fresh, the prices are reasonable, so is the service, humour and music. Everything is just right!",Kathodon
40,"It is great place to eat good, fresh food. The meals are big and tasty. They have a great orange juice made from fresh fruits. Service could be better, but I can't make any complains.",Kathodon
40,"We had a short break in Nicosia;after checking in our hotel we wandered about and decided to have lunch at the Kathodon; it's virtually adjacent to the Ledra Crossing Point-you can't miss it. We enjoyed it so much, we ate here every evening. Good food-reasonable prices. One evening we saw a waiter deliver a take away to the Police hut at the Crossing Point-must be good if the locals like it.",Kathodon
40,A very untouristic setup in a tourist passage 100m before the crossing. Recommended. Good regional drinks at reasonable prices.,Kathodon
50,"Walking up Ledra Street, the main pedestrian drag in Old Nicosia, is like walking up main street,anytown, Europe. McDonald's, KFC, Chain Italians, ice cream joints....but keep going till 100 metres before the checkpoint and your patience will be rewarded, Here is that rarity in Cyprus - a real mainland Greek restaurant/ meze house.There are specialities from across Greece - try the Cretan smoked pork and the crisp rissoles filled with tender aubergine.The taramasalata is thick and pungent - and best of all there's retsina from Thessalonika, rather than the iffy wines of Cyprus, to drink.We sat next to some authentically corpulent,bead-fiddling locals, and the (head?) waiter was both cheerful and helpful - they have fixed meze menus but it's worth picking and choosing from the extensive list. We didn't try the main dishes but my bet is they'll be pretty good too.On the walls inside, there are acres of photos of celebs who've visited. You may not recognise many of them, but you can't mistake President Bill Clinton, looking as if he'd eaten and drunk quite well!All in all a great find in a part of town that's mostly given over to visitors - the other rated restaurants tend to be out in the affluent suburbs.",Kathodon
50,"This is really worth a visit reasonably priced excellent choice of varied menu and staff who are more than willing to help. At the time of the visit a duet were playing with lovely background music, this is a very nice place to try",Kathodon
50,"I've been wanting to go to this place for meze for some time and my visit didn't disappoint me. The menu offers delicious dishes you don't come across very often, dishes that take time to prepare and you need to be skilled to make them nice. I absolutely recommend it.We went there on a Sunday and even with a last minute's notice, we were able to arrange a table ahead and have it set for us when we arrived. Excellent service, very friendly staff and delicious food. What more can you ask for?The offer 'dish of the day' which is usually one of the specially prepared traditional dishes. Do ask your waiter about it!",Kathodon
50,Two visits in two nights probably says it all. Super Greek food be it mezze or kebabs or grilled meat or moussaka. Each meal that we ordered was large but the price was very reasonable. Really enjoyed the mixed pork kebab and seftalie sausages.The restaurant is at the northern end of Ledra Street and is popular with locals. Musical entertainment as well every night.Well worth a visit if you are in Nicosia.,Kathodon
50,"Service here might seem a little slow but hey it doesn't hurt to wait for fresh well prepared food. Prices in Euros were good, we had main meal for three for only £28.00, including bread and drinks. Superb atmosphere loads of locals and cheerful happy waiters, waitresses. Good view out to the Main Street which links North and South Cyprus, you can even sit outside and absorb even more atmosphere out under cover. Comfortable and fun.",Kathodon
50,"very nice place with greek live music and tasty food.very friendly staff.clean, in very good location",Kathodon
50,"We visited Kathodon (On the way, in Greek) on the first cold December night in Nicosia. As the place was absolutely full, we sat outside, with heating provided by ""patio heaters"", but we never complained! We enjoyed enormously whatever we ordered, from appetizers to salad to ""soutzoukakia the Smyrna way"" to meat covered with yogurt, listening throughout to the gentle live music transmitted from inside, and sipping the wonderful red house wine. All in all, Kathodon to excellence.",Kathodon
50,"Perfect place to go with friends, wonderful music, unique location at the end of Lydra ...Smiling and helpful everyone who works there ...Τhe food delicious and fresh, I suggest you go to eat and drink ... Have wonderful Cypriot wine and zivana. Οffered by the shop Shots mastycha.We'll be back with my friends soon",Kathodon
40,"OK, it is on touristy Ledras Street but we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was quite calm (8pm in late October) so there was no need to book. The waiters were friendly, chatty and efficient. I was told that they had Kleftiko as dish of the day, and Kleftiko it was. After an enjoyable starter of hot and spicy melted cheese and pitta bread, the lamb and potatoes arrived, wrapped in parchment paper. It was absolutely delicious! My wife had the moussaka which is on the regular menu. She found it a bit dry and wasn't too impressed. We didn't order a dessert as we had been eating far too much during our holiday. The waiter then brought us a complimentary glass of Mastiha liqueur and explained the legend of the shrubs shedding tears on Chios, which was nice.For what it's worth, the next day, our hotel receptionist recommended this restaurant as her first choice in the area.",Kathodon
30,"Enjoyed mezzes and moussaka, local red wine. Competent cooking with friendly service, complimentary little glass of hooch (I guess ouzo) at the finish. Buzzing with many guests, local and foreign.",Kathodon
30,"An average restaurant amongst many on Ledral street as you approach the 'green line' which divides Nicosia. My wife's squid was fine, but my lamb kebab was a disaster: very tough and no flavour. The service is 'not really interested', as is illustrated by the fact that they never enquired were things okay.",Kathodon
40,"Well established restaurant right on the border crossing. Food is very good and plenty. We had the mezze and it was a lot of dips and grilled meats. Very enjoyable. Service is also very good, friendly and efficient.",Kathodon
50,"I liked the food- It is greek meze/dishes and it was delicious.It is better to go and sit there when the weather is nice, so you can sit outside. The tables are in the end of Ledras pedestrian street. You can combine it with a walk in the old city. The night there is a guy with a guitar singing ight old greek songs.",Kathodon
30,not much service when busyfood overcookedwaiters did not ask if we needed anything they were too busy serving others,Kathodon
50,"That's good tavern with Greek specialities. They have cyprus meals, greek and europian, so you can choose whatever you like. Prices is reasonable. Service isn't good, they are slow and you have to wait a lot to give order or get bill. But this is not a big problem if you are with friends there :)",Kathodon
30,"We went with friends to this restaurant and had to really struggle to get waiter attention, who were also rude. The highlight was when a friend went to find the owner after we had asked for the bill to five different waiters and waited for 30' mins and nothing happened and his answer was 'this is not so important'! We vowed never to go back! The food was OK but nothing special, there are much better places.",Kathodon
50,This was our most preferred restaurant in Nicosia city centre; and we went there 3 times in 2 days! It offered a large variety of food at reasonable prices. Staff was extremely friendly and gave us good recommendations. It is always fully booked. Therefore you better make reservation in advance!,Kathodon
50,"By far the best local food and tastes that we tried and repeated a few times.everytime we tried something different and everytime we were amazed by howdelicious it all was, really good home cooking from A to Z.Service was excellent, everytime a different waiter and guess what.they all somehow spoke a very GOOD english and always served uswith a SMILE.if we go back (soon) we know where we will be going a few times for a treat andI mean it, a real TREAT.A must...try it for yourself.food service and price unmatched anywhere, my word for it.",Kathodon
40,"I went there a while ago we ordered only appetizers they were pretty tasty. The atmposphere was okay, i would recommend it, but i think its quite on the pricy side.",Kathodon
50,Kathodon is my favorite restaurant in Nicosia. They have very good greek food in good prices. You can eat dinner with dessert and jug of wine for less than 20$ per person.Service is good.Main part of tables are situated outside near boardwalk so you have to be used to people passing by.,Kathodon
50,"We nearly didn't try this restaurant as it looked like a typical tourist place - glossy menu displayed outside , a bit brash looking and situated right next to the crossing to north Nicosia on Ledra Street but we were hungry and very hot and there were a few interesting veg dishes listed. Anyway, we had a most pleasant surprise as it turned out to serve tasty traditional village dishes, cooked really well and all delivered with friendly attention. We were able to find out about how things were cooked/made and exactly what they were and on trying three desserts between two of us just because they sounded interesting, one of them was provided on the house - a really nice touch.",Kathodon
40,The food here is really good and service is very friendly. The position of this restaurant is excellent at the end of Ledra Street which has some very good shops. Take some time to view the interior walls which have some very interesting photos on. The toilets are very clean and amusing!!!! A must visit restaurant.,Kathodon
50,"Went here a few days ago and evenat 11.00 at night the place was full of locals. The food was really fresh and tasty, service was friendly and there was a chilled, relaxed atmosphere.Would definitely recommend x",Kathodon
50,We went there after our visit to Ledras street and after listening to our Cypriot friends reccomendations! We enjoyed it a lot and we would have gone back if we had more days to spend in Nicosia!,Kathodon
30,"The food is ok.. Plenty of cypriot dishes to choose, quality ok. However the best part is the location... The tavern is located at the end of ledra street a very busy road so you could walk up the street which is full of restaurants and shops and then sit there to enjoy a nice cypriot dish",Kathodon
40,"At the end of Ledras street, in the hard of old town and just two steps from the occupied area with nice outdoor sitting, styling inside with decoration that reminds Greek Islands. The food perfect, tasty and reasonable prices. We will go again.",Kathodon
50,Excellent food every time from a varied menu. Waiters explain the items and make recommendations so we tried dishes we've never heard of before and loved every one. Good wine. Good value for money. Would definitely go back.,Kathodon
50,"My husband and I visited this restaurant yesterday for lunch. We had great food, served with a genuine smile. We were initially offered a meze but this was too much for us so went with the waiters suggestions which were original and delicious. We loved every mouthful. The waiter was kind enough to share his recipes with me. I will do my best to replicate them. We will definately go back even though it is quite a distance from our house in Pissouri. Certainly worth the visit. Thank you",Kathodon
40,"We were visiting Cyprus with a group, and escaped for an evening. This place is Greek as opposed to Greek Cypriot, and people will answer in Greek if you speak Greek - something nobody else in Cyprus ever did. The food is authentic, service is good, and people watching is above average. Plus, you're within spitting distance of the demarcation line, which adds to the excitement - unless you're from Berlin.",Kathodon
50,A lovely restaurant located at the end of ledras cobbled street where you can enjoy Greek meze and ouzo :) friendly staff always ready to help and a friendly owner. If you go at night time there is also Greek music. I highly recommend this restaurant !!,Kathodon
40,"The tavern is at the end of Ledra street before the occupied part. The food is traditional greek with the local specialties. In general is clean, fresh and tasty.",Kathodon
50,"I really love this restaurant because the food they serve is Cypriot traditional with a hint of Greek cuisine. All is always fresh and homemade. Service is fast and staff friendly. Kathodon is located directly in the centre of the town, at the end of Ledra street. Its easy to have nice lunch there and relax after shopping or sightseeing. Definitely my favourite place! We will come again.",Kathodon
50,What a lovely restaurant - the service was really good and the meze had some really authentic dishes you don't often get - I thought it was great. It is a busy location but is a great spot for people watching in Ledra Street - I would definitely go back again,Kathodon
40,"We got there around 8:30 pm on a Saturday. There were only a handful of tables taken outside, the rest on the outside and all of the inside was empty. We got there and asked for a table for 3 (myself, wife & young child). The waiter informed us all of the tables were reserved. He looks around and set us up a table near the grill area outside, taking chairs from other tables of people not using all of their chairs. We watched this occur for everyone that came up for the next almost 2 hours, some sitting near the alley or at the closed restaurant next door. However, the tables inside and out that weren't filled, were never used in that entire time. We left while this was still happening, I get the feeling those tables were never filled that night at all, but there was such a big deal about them being reserved. We watched as a larger group of maybe 6 people actually left b/c they were told this same thing. Doesn't make any sense to me, maybe an attempt to get people to start using reservations?On to the review of the food. Once we were seated, after the show of treating us special to get a table, the service was good. The food was very tasty and quite a bit was served for the price. The food was prepared perfectly and was very enjoyable. This restaurant is located inside the walls, very near where you cross over to the north.",Kathodon
50,"Excellent Greek meze food (especially the grilled octopus, fried vegetables and appetizers). Prices are reasonable, but not on the cheap side. Occasionally there's live Greek music. The location is ideal for a break from shopping and sightseeing. It's also really popular with the locals and sometimes you'll find that all the tables are taken.",Kathodon
50,the best restaurant with good meze and Greek music....enjoy and fun .personnel very friendly .....clean and above all prices very reasonable........,Kathodon
50,"A pleasant location at the end of Ledra street, a small terrace with a freaking statue of a Greek national guard standing by the entrance of the restaurant. Not knowing what to choose from the rich menu, we decided to have a mezze, expecting the parade of meat dishes we usually have in Cypriot restaurants. We were pleasantly surprised when a succession of delicious cheese based dishes (nothing to do with the traditional grilled khalloumi) was followed by sophisticated tasty meat dishes (by far the best I have eaten in Cyprus). The waiters were really nice they named every dish they served us. The dishes arrived gradually to the table not all at the same time.Will certainly go back there when visiting Cyprus the next time.",Kathodon
50,"We ate here twice during a recent visit, once at lunch time and once in the evening. The food and service were excellent and we highly recommend it.",Kathodon
30,"The menu also says ""we don't serve nervous people and people in a hurry.""Probably a Psychiatrist that opened a restaurant I thought but then I realized the personel were the nervous people and people in a hurry. Other things that remind Athens are the sort of tasty and presentable food with a grill smell in the street to attract people and the digestion problems you get afterwards.",Kathodon
50,An original Greek tavern with AMAZING Greek mezes (small portions of many plates)We ordered meze for two! You have to try Tzatziki and kolokithokeftedes!!! The price was very good too! With about 15€ per person you can eat everything! 5* Bravo guys,Kathodon
50,"I walked past this place during my exploration of Nicosia and probably would have avoided it (thinking its a tourist trap) but a friend recommended it so I went later last night. I went around 8pm and got the last single table. Within minutes the place was full and the atmosphere was great! Noisy, lively and exciting. The menu (in English too) was extensive and amusingly written. There was live Cypriot music too which was very atmospheric. I wanted Cypriot mezze and I wasn't disappointed. I left FULL and satisfied and although I had been dining alone, I had a great deal of fun. The staff were friendly and the quality of the food was excellent. Don't avoid this place. Visit, enjoy and fill up!",Kathodon
50,"I was very impressed by the earlier Reviews on the Kathodon, and decided to visit it yesterday with my family; I arrived there early to make reservation, and luckily found the Restaurant empty; however, this didn’t last long as in few minutes; the restaurant was full. The menu was packed with a huge variety of mainly Cypriot and partially International cuisine. As it was our first visit; we decided to try most dishes by ordering a Meze; it was a great pleasant experience; a superior quality; each dish was a unique taste making it stand out in comparison with the traditional meze served in most Taverns. The service was excellent; and unlike most Taverns serving all dishes in almost one shot; dishes were served gradually; we enjoyed every dish tremendously. We recommend the Meze for first time visitors; this will not make their selection task easier the next time, as they will order the whole Meze again.",Kathodon
50,"We found this restaurant taking a walking tour to the old city of Nicosia. There are just a few on Ledras street looking like a traditional tavern. They offered as a menu in english and we have found some funny restaurant's comments to the dishes listed, for example ""Greek traditional salad (without cabbage of course...)"", Tsatziki dip (do not go for a date after), Spicy Feta dip (in other words the crazy one!) and finally about ouzo : (1st brings apetite, 2nd health, 3rd brings joy, 4th happiness, 5th conversation, 6th big arguments, 7th clash and the 8th the police). The meze was one of the best among we have tried, the Cyprian white wine was fruity and refreshing. After a couple of days we have returned back and the waiters recognized us. It is professional. So at the last day of our business trip we went for a 3rd time for a lamb and again everything was excellent. The prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend.",Kathodon
40,"This is the nearest you can get to good Greek/Cypriot food on Ledras. Had a very good meal, half litre of wine was average; price was very reasonable; music and local liquor Mastic was very welcome. Staff were very helpful and good fun. Altogether a pleasant meal.",Kathodon
50,"To sum it up: Good food! Good atmosphere! Good service! And at a good price!. Have been there 2 times the last 2 weeks, and it was all perfect. And both nights (mondays) there was good live music. Good artists with guitar singing greek ballads.",Kathodon
50,"Great service, excellence in taste of food, nice place and very delicious foods. I would definitely go again soon and recomend it in many people as well.",Kathodon
50,"When owner Mr Stakhis warmly welcomed us into his restaurant we were already taken by the vibrant atmosphere of his clients, there was certainly a good vibe. The walls of this place speak of history, pride and respect for what makes a restaurant a place where food maintains its traditional role of bringing families together at the table for a great authentic Greek Cypriot meal. Try everything, especially the Mezes.",Kathodon
40,"We were invited to go there by friends. I didn't think much of the place, but after my experience I would go again,and I would recomend it. The food is very nice, they have some traditional greek meze that you don't eat every day. Very nice house wine. Very good service. The staff and the owners are very polite! There is live music, but not the kind of music that makes your ears go deaf and you can't listen to what people are saying. Nice greek music, easy to listen to, while you eat your tasty meze and drink your wine. I found the quantities of meze they bring quite reasonable. Their tyrokafteri is yummi! Plus, I would say that the price is close to reasonable, considering we ate and drank very well, and listened to music. I would definitely go again!",Kathodon
50,"We went to Nicosia for the day and after spending 30 minutes wandering around the Turkish side of the capital and taking in the dirty sites we crossed back across the dead zone to the lovely clean Greek Cypriot side of the city!We then managed to find our way into a local jewellers who we asked for the best place to eat Greek Cypriot in the city and she immediately pointed us next door but one to the lovely lively friendly super clean restaurant which is Kathodon!!!We sat down and from the beginning to the end of our Greek Cypriot Meze experience we were unbelievably satisfied and full to the brim with beautifully cooked food with a carafe of local sweet white wine, our meal for the 6 of us was recommended by the waiter who showed us to our table, as another tripadvisor member mentioned let the waiters decide for you, an amazing idea which pulled of tremendously for us!!!All in all beautiful food, beautiful atmosphere and also the waiters were superb describing each dish and the owner also came out to speak with us and also gave us a drink each on the house as we explained to him how beautiful his food and restaurant were!!!Get to Nicosia and get to Kathodon!!!!!",Kathodon
50,"Went there for dinner a few weeks ago. The Moussaka and wine were quite excellent! The staff was very polite! The price was reasonable. Great ambience and greek live-music. We could even sit outside late, due to heaters, they put up. All in all a very good experience.",Kathodon
40,"We ate here twice, for lunch. Our meals both time were great but the second visit the waiter suggested what we eat. He made a great selection: cuccini ball (zucchini) were big balls of freshly grated zucchini & herbs deep fried; spicy hot feta & cheese which was like a hot dip and really cheesy; soutzoukabia from smyrna which is red pepper & tomato with sausage (my favorite); and lamb skewers. All washed down with local wine.It was all fantastic. We sat outside and watched the parade of people making the border crossing from the occupied north and the Republic in the south.kathodon@primetel.com.cy",Kathodon
40,"This was a nice place to have an early dinner with a friend. The ouzo was very good. The salad was fresh. The waiters were very helpful. One of them helped us with the food choice. We wanted sea food so he helped us pick octopus, calamari and a fresh grilled fish. The amount was perfect because he helped with the portion sizes. We sat outside in the pedestrian street, about 10 meters from the Turkish check-point. Very peculiar site indeed. At the end of the night, they helped by calling a taxi. We did not sit inside but I took pictures and it was truly a feast for the eyes. Good Greek food (as the owner says in the menu) from Asia Minor. Oh, the menu also says ""we don't serve nervous people and people in a hurry."" Good to know...",Kathodon
50,"I visited this wonderful restaurant last week with my family and friends. All were enchanted by the service, the traditional and tasty food and the wonderful Greek music. The atmosphere is unmatched. The staff was very polite, considering the fact that our children were kind of … naughty :). The food can only be described in two words - just perfect. We will definitely visit this place again. Recently we’ve organized a surprise birthday party at Kathodon for one of our colleagues. The entire staff helped us with organization and additional ideas for the surprise party. In short - I'm fascinated by this restaurant.",Kathodon
20,"I visited Kathodon few days ago with family, we were trying to contact the waiters to order but noone gave attention to us. Finally when we ordered food nobody took order for drinks, we almost finished our dinner when finally a waiter came to take order for our drinks.The food was below average, and the service filthy.I don't know if this happened because the restaurant was full, but this is unacceptable.",Kathodon
40,"With good Greek food (not Cypriot) on good location - pedestrian street, no cars going by - and correct prices",Kathodon
30,The food was just ok without any special taste. There are many more greek restaurants in Nicosia that are far better.,Kathodon
40,Kathodon on Greek means going someware in this situation going to the end of the last divided city of Europe Nicosia. It is a small greek style restaurant at the end of Ledras Str in Old Nicosia. a gread place to rest and eat after a long day of sightseeng and shopping in the center of Nicosia.,Kathodon
30,"Even though the location is fantastic right by the border at the end of Ledras, the food quality varies. The best time to go is early evening, or lunch if its not too hot. Sit outside. More reviews here www.cypriotandproud.com",Kathodon
30,"Quite a small place, although bigger than it used to be. Tables and chairs are too crowded for comfort. The food is interesting. The atmosphere is great. People are paying more attention to the music than the food - it is for me one of those places where you get good music but average food.",Kathodon
20,I've been to this restaurant twice...the first time I found a hair in my salad...the 2nd time I gave this place a shot I was utterly dissapointed. I visited with my Greek husband who had the kokoretsi...he said it was not edible...it was that bad... I had a salad and the cheese crocquettes...they were average. nd then the bill came and we said to ourselves 'never again!' It's a nice place to sit with a beer and watch people passing by but there are other restaurants with much better food to eat in.,Kathodon
30,"The Place is very Nice and situated at Ledra Street Nicosia. If you visit it you can see both tourists and local people. In my visit i was very dissapointed. The food was just average. Just to explain. You order meze which in Cyprus include: salads,starters,main plates and a desert .The 90% that the restaurant offers are just starters and they avoid to bring you the main couses which is the real food. At the service there is a trick too. They serve the plates as slowly as they can. First starter at 15 minutes, second plate at half an hour etc. For this reason your stomach is fed slowly with starters, and the customer don't compalint about not receiving the main dishes.If you are really hungry thin again.Just my 2 cents!",Kathodon
50,It's a Greek fusion cuisine which I truly love. Right next to the old Green Line and now Checkpoint between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. It's a must to visit this restaurant with really nice music on the radio and sth different in your mouth to taste.,Kathodon
50,A very nice restaurant located at the end of Ledra street. staff is friendly and the food is extremely good. Definitely go again on my next visit in Nicosia!! Thank you for a wonderful dinner,Kathodon
50,The staff were a great compliment to the meal. We ordered the Meze for each of us. Each dish was thoroughly described as it arrived at our table. No knowing what to expect and everything just kept getting better our waiter warned us about eating to much pita bread and not to eat too fast. Sitting outside was a bonus as you get to see the true personality of the locals.,Kathodon
10,"As a cypriot local I didn't like the food at all. It's a greek fusion cuisine, the portions were small, default taste, fries were frozen before, and the whole food was a joke. We left unsatissfied and paid an uneven amount of money for the food we unfortunately ate.I would prepare a meal on my own, in my house 100 times better than that.Also the waiters, were at least careless, hasty, and a bit rude. It's a shame that place is in a turistic venue.",Kathodon
50,the food is very nice and the bring a lot of food! its nicer to visit it in summer to sit on the front side of the restaurant,Kathodon
50,I visited whilst on a business trip this week. The best Meze I have had for a long time. We sat outside with the patio heaters listening tom the locals singing away to live music. An excellent evening out!,Kathodon
50,"The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is great!! There is also excellent traditional music and the restaurant is packed with locals. If you are in Nicosia you must pay this restaurant a visit for a wonderful, relaxing and enjoyable evening. Don't forget to make a reservation especially in summer as it'll be impossible to find a table!",Kathodon
50,"The restaurant is based on the exceptional personality of the owner, which is impregnated with greek principles, traditional receipts very often originating from ""lost countries""...

40,"We ate here at the recommendation of a native of Nicosia and it was fantastic. Very friendly staff, who even forced a free dessert on us! We had a shared starter of tzatziki, pittas and halloumi, two bottles of water, a small beer and three mains. The total amount came to €40, which seemed excellent given the size of portions and quality of food, especially given the central location of it.",Kathodon
