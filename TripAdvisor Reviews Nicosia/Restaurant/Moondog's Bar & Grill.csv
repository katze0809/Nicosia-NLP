20,"Good sized burger served with poor salt and pepper and rather dry, asked for HP sauce to boost taste and the waiter came back to announce ‚Äúno HP sauce‚Äù without any hint of suggesting something. The table did not have salt and pepper or any other sauce (ketchup/mayonnaise/mustard)..Most likely ‚Äúchef‚Äù thinks his burgers are fine as is.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,Been here a few times and burgers usually fresh and tasty and they offer a huge variety of n nicely chilled beers.,Moondog's Bar & Grill

Loved the music and watching old photos on the screen. We did nt eat but the food and portions looked amazing. All the staff were really chatted and attentive.

And the burgers although they are not low fat, they are super tasty, especially the moondogs burger with cheese and bacon.It does get very packed in there so I would advise if you are going the later part of the week to book a table in the evening as it gets very busy.You will have a great time there. Just make sure to take the right company.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
20,"We had been there before, mainly in the summer because they have a great variety of beers. The food is so so. Yesterday we were looking for a warm place for a drink with the current cold weather. We asked to sit in the non smoking area inside. It was probably colder then their outside, smoking area where they have heaters. All the doors were wide open as staff were doing their evening preparations. When we commented our comments were laughed away. what a way to run a business!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"It had a wide selection of gourmet burgers, beers and a decent snack selection, but it's pricey, you can get better food for half the price in other places if you're on a budget",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,I think the place made a good brand especially for the variety of the beers. The service is getting worst every time. Waiters just pass through to order and do not give the appropriate importance on the order. My beer last night came with the cap imagining that i have the strength of 2 persons or a bottle opener with me.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Probably one of the best places in Nicosia. The dishes are amazing, including a combination of gorgeous burgers and a variety of beers from all around the world. I highly recommend it, especially during football events...",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Visited restaurant for first time during Christmas period.For our good luck we arrived without reservation but we manage to have a table in non-smoking area.Menu is big with many ""American"" style dishes. We had the Big Jack burger the chicken enchiladas and the pulled pork tacos.All were tasty in large portions. We Combine our lunch with appropriate beer and we enjoy a lot. For desert we share the Nutella oreo burger!!Only negative for the place is the service that is too slow. Whenever we ask for a waiter the answer was to give him two minutes!! Also the food served with a big delay (more than 35 minutes).",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"Some friends we decided to have a get toogether before christmas. The first impresion was a other american cheap restaurant. Threafter, the seats were unconfortable, and the movements were very dificult. The food wss good but not special, it was so bowring that I do not remember it. The plus of the restaurant was the staff, very friendly and quick , excellent service.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Yesterday after work around 6 we went to Moondog's with some gests from Spain for an early dinner and drinks.I called before and asked for a table and they told me it was ok but we should leave before 9 which I accepted.The table they gave us at first was in a corner next to the kitchen and a an open door.It was freezing.We asked for another table..they gave us one next to the front door but there was a heater so we said ok.But no they moved the heater closed to another table...Again we complained and finally we got a better spot.I want to pointout that many tables with better location were empty until we left.The food was as expected, the portions more than enough the service very good(apart from the sitting arrangements) until we asked for a final shot...We asked for zivania for our gests....they did not have any(really???)We asked for Jack Daniels the same responce without any effort to give us an alternative...As I said if we were regulars we would have been treated in a better way given a better table(we left and many were still empty).Unfortunately for them we had decided to have a big company party in February there, but now we are searchinh for another place!",Moondog's Bar & Grill

10,"I have been here quite a few times over the years and my experience has been quite pleasant overall. But today we were treated so badly I left quite overwhelmed. Service was slow, food arrived late and it was cold. But my problem was with the treatment received from the manager. Instead of him apologizing, I (the customer) was told off. He said the food was not late, it was perfect and there was no way it was cold. In other words that I was simply lying. All that to my face. He said it was a full house so I should have no expectations of being served within half an hour, cause that was a ridiculous claim from my side. I have never experienced such treatment from a restaurant manager anywhere in the world or in my life. And I travel quite a lot. This was my last visit to this place and you need to understand customer service in 2019 is as important as quality of food.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
20,Excellent range of beers. Very bad service. Very slow and uninformed waiters. Quality of food is very mediocre. Good for after work drinks.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"I really love the food there, the burgers are absolutely amazing and they have the biggest beer selection on the island for sure. Great place to watch the football games with a giant projector screen in the back. I will definitely go back a gain for more beer and burgers. The only thing I didn't like were the nachos, tasted like store bought nachos with cheese on top.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

40,A good ambience busy bar. With a vast selection of beers and coctails and finger and bar food. Getting busy therefore a reservation is recommended.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"This is the second time that I have been to Moondog's. The first time I gave this establishment 5 stars but was dissatisfied recently. The decor and overall appearance is really nice. A sports fan will really appreciate the combination of beer and sports tv. The beer menu is massive. Even though the restraunt was somewhat empty, the servers were slow and nearly non existent. The most problematic concern was that the nachos I ordered was cold. With no customers and a full staff, this should never happen. The prices are rather pricey and cold nachos should never happen. The flat bread was superb. I can only imagine if the venue was full what kind of service and quality one might receive.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Best burger in cypres thx for this good food . When I come back to cypres I will come to your restaurant again,Moondog's Bar & Grill

20,"Good food overshadowed by the lack of profesionalism of the staff. The guy who greeted us clearly did no want us to sit outside although it wasnt too busy even after we left. We were forced to ask a lady to take our order because noone showed up at our table, the lady then went to call someone else because she couldnt take our order. The guy who actually took our order did not speak any greek was impatient and was unwilling to answer our questions regarding the menu. Why set someone to take orders in a restaurant / bar that does not speak the native language?",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Nice place for football - beer lovers. many screens including one of the largest in Nicosia. Satisfying menu for every customer, nice burgers",Moondog's Bar & Grill

In additional to that they have a super massive beer list. There is an endless beer catalogue with every beer you can imagine.They host a burger week every year as well with some limited edition burger dishes.Price are ok for what you get. I think is better to make a reservation if you are planning to go on a busy night (football night for example).I am a frequent visitor at this place and i had no bad experiences or bad service so far.

40,"Our meal here was fantastic - special children's options included a mini burger and chicken tenders, which had been freshly cooked. My chicken kebab was lightly spiced and had a good helping of house coleslaw and fries, whilst my husband was served an enormous burger, which he said was one of the best that he had had. There is a huge range of beers available, but limited wine. The bar was filled with locals enjoying a football match on the screens dotted around - very noisy for a family meal but totally in keeping with the concept.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

40,"Last minute decided to go we have not been before. Parking is little difficult. Could find parking and had to walk, if its not raining ok. The decor great. Our waiter very helpful in helping us with the menu. The food again very tasty. The only comment i would make regarding the food is that for such a large chop the caramelized onions was not enough. My only complaint was once we finished we sad around for 10 minutes without anyone asking us if we needed anything else. It took several tries to get the attention of a waiter and in the end we had to get up and go to the bar to ask for the bill. I did notice that we where not the only table that had the same problem.

We had burger which where huge but really good. The only thing, but this is almost everywhere in Cyprus like this I have the feeling, is that they are not very attentive and we sat there long times without drinks. They never did ask if we want something else. And since it is always crowded you need to be patient to catch someone for drinks...",Moondog's Bar & Grill

When we arrived they lied to us that they couldn‚Äôt find the reservation and that they had mistaken my name. When I told them that it‚Äôs not important under which name the reservation is, just give us the table we reserved they gave us another table outside (not inside) and they told us they would have come back to us and give us our table. After 20 minutes I complained again to the waiter as nobody seemed to give us any attention, he finally offered us a table inside and told me that because there was a football match they had given our table to someone else and that they hadn‚Äôt left yet. So don‚Äôt be assured that you will find your table that you have reserved. Very unreliable and unprofessional!! And they even lied to us that they couldn‚Äôt find our reservation and that it was under a different name! Pathetic!!!",Moondog's Bar & Grill

40,"Moondogs looks like any typical bar from the outside, we were not sure it was actually open but go straight in past the outdoor seating to the very welcome coolness of the indoor bar area. A delight to enter from the blistering afternoon July heat of Nicosia!Quite an American diner/sports bar type of place with lots of burger and sausage options on the menu but a reasonable amount of healthier options too. There's a whole menu dedicated to different beers.Sizeable portions - the triple slider burger would have fed a family of 5! Excellent value and service with a smile.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Don‚Äôt be put off by all the TV screens (I nearly was as it‚Äôs the football World Cup). The food is really great (Have the Pork Chop!). The staff are helpful and keen to make your night fun. Surprisingly good back bar with Scotches ranging from entry level to 15yr Glengoyne and Bowmore Darkest (Lagavulin 16 is of course there too).

Asked for a piece of butter and HEAR THIS THE ANSWER: I WILL LOOK IN THE KITCHEN IF I CAN FIND.When waiter became really rude he cancelled in front of us and before he meets his manager our order and returned the menus of our table!Honestly, this restaurant can be compared only with junk food chains.

I liked that there was a bar that organizes such a nice event.. it was a great opportunity to taste new beers and ales. Buuut, there's unfortunately a but. We visited again, we tried at least a day after my work. We were stopped at the entrance and the man asked if we had a reservation. We answered no and he told us that they need a reservation. Although the bar was empty... I understand that maybe there wasn't a table available but not even a seat at the bar?",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Moondog's virtue is a beer menu larger than the food menu and an American feel to the atmosphere. The food is satisfactory and the portions adequate. If you are accustomed to Roadhouse Bars, and want to find a piece of America, I recommend this restaurant. A little hard to find but a parking lot is next to the front door. Parking can be difficult downtown.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

30,"I visited Moondogs many times during last year and I had no issues with the service or with the food. My last visit though was disappointing. The food was below average, and an example would be that the bread holding our burgers was cold(not properly defrosted). The meat platter was very poor, If that meat platter was meant to be for 4 persons as described in the menu, then something is definately wrong with the portion and with what you are going to pay for. Other than that, great atmosphere, nice music, and it still remains the best place to visit to watch sports in Nicosia. I am going to give this place another chance in the near future.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

MUST: this is one of the few places in Cyprus that has happy hour 5 - 8 Monday - Friday.Bonus tip: If you want to watch a sport that you would usually not find a showing in Cyprus this place will accommodate from NFL, Rugby, e.t,c just call before and confirm",Moondog's Bar & Grill

50,One of my favorite burger places in Nicosia. Is a must go if you like burgers. The selection is massive and the cooking and taste are exceptional. In additional to that they have a super massive beer list. There is an endless beer catalogue with every beer you can imagine.They host a burger week every year as well with some limited edition burger dishes.Price are ok for what you get.

30,"After a year or so, I decided to give this place another shot. Everyone kept saying that their burgers are the best, I disagreed but I had no recent tasting of this place so I went there on Burgerfest. As I expected, meat was tasteless, blue cheese was just a tiny slice added just to justify the name. Potatoes are frozen, and sauces just cover the fast foodiness of everything.

30,"I've been to Moondog's twice in the past couple months. The environment is nice and there's a great beer selection. Wait staff has been attentive at both occasions.The food however is not great. It is typical ""american style"" bar food but not well prepared. The nachos we had the last time were quite bad, guacamole was bland and didn't taste like it was house-made, salsa was bland too, cheese tasted more plasticky than it did cheesy and the nachos were soggy. We had some zucchini fritters too which were ok taste-wise but quite oily. Main dishes are the typical protein-carb-veg you encounter at this type of establishment (TGI Fridays, Applebees and the like), looked quite anemic and prepared without much desire to deliver food that is above standard.Overall, I would definitely recommend Moondog's for a beer or a drink in Nicosia, but I'd suggest eating something at home first.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

Overall a very nice experience, and I will definitely come back!",Moondog's Bar & Grill

If you are more of a salad person, try the rocket salad with the stake.Environment is nice, with large monitors for football and sport lovers. Carefully decorated, it provides a pub atmosphere inviting you to taste the beers!Service is not so good and this is a drawback that management does not seem to be aware of, or doesn't care to address. This time for us, I was subjected to a full beer spilt all over me (just saved the mobile phones.....).If it wasn't for the food we wouldn't have gone there again.Choose your reason for going there.....",Moondog's Bar & Grill

50,"A true representative of its name, Moondog's is just like a Bar & Grill should be. With its laid back atmosphere, the dominance of wood in the decoration and furniture, signs on the walls, a pool table, high tables and stools, the place is shout-out to classic American style bars.But that doesn't mean the food is cheap, or filthy. On the contrary!! Neatly served on wooden cutting boards, their burgers are a paradise to taste! Even though every single one I tried was delicious, the one that stands out is the Guinness Burger. It is the epitome of burger-ship, a taste that will have you returning again in the future!Accompany that with one of the numerous chilled beers they have, grab a football match on one of the many screens (or the hidden backyard projector - great during summery nights), or simply enjoy the rocky sounds flooding the place and you are in for a memorable time!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"It is not on one of the main streets and doesn't attract you immediately. But the music and ambiance surrounds you immediately when you enter. The meal menu is on one page and consists of mainly burgers; but they are delicious. The beer menu, however, is a booklet and comprehensive. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about beers and made excellent recommendations.There is rock music playing. The decoration also has the theme of rock groups. The design of the toilets are very nice. The washbasins and urinals are made of beer barrels.If you like beer and rock music, you must visit this place in Cyprus. There is also a DJ on Friday nights.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

40,"Huge range of beers and food. The place is warm and cosy. I found the Blue Cheese burger being more tasteful than their signature burger but I also added caramelised onions and a slice of bacon. The vegetables were delicious too. The meat was very good still not the best I ever had but I guess my standards are a bit high as I'm a big burger lover. Medium to well done didn't convince us, as it didn't have any colour of red in the meat . It looked like well done. Nevertheless, it was a great experience.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

40,The place is decent. Huge issue: the working hours are wrong: it starts at 12:30 and not 10:00. It caused us too long to wait!The cheeseburger was no more than OK and I expected more than that from a place that have so many burgers on the menu.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
20,"This review is to trigger an alarm to the owner's as it is a very nice place for beer and food and it will be a shame if they loose the quality.I am visiting Moondog's frequently with friends and family, for beer or lunch, at noon or at night.

50,"Over in Cyprus on holiday and arranged to meet a friend in Moondogs to watch the game. Arrived and parked in the car park opposite for ‚Ç¨2.50 for all day, my friend had booked a table for us so we were shown to our table. Surprised at the size of the bar as it goes back further than it looks from the road. As I was driving I ordered a Diet Coke, but was amazed at the amount of beers that were available to drink. I ordered the chicken Kebab and my friend ordered the Lamb chop, the food arrived in good time and was hot. The lamb chop was massive and was cooked as per how my friend asked for it to be cooked. My chicken kebab (skewers) chips, salad and pitta bread was very nice and well flavoured. Looking around at other people's food the portions are big and everyone else cleaned their plates which was a good sign.Staff were also attentive without being over powering.A special mention for the gents toilets with the beer barrels as urinals and sinks...great ideaIf you are in Nicosia and want to watch a game I would recommend Moondogs without hesitation, especially an Arsenal game",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"Great staff, brilliant beer selection,But unfortunately average food :( We shared a platter and a wild chicken plate. , pork was Dry, wings where bland, and the wild chicken was well made, but the sauce was plane and lacking any character but at-least the sausage and the rings on the platter where good !I believe the Kitchen staff need some motivating and better training!.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,The menu has a great selection of burgers and platters that can be shared when with friends. Excellent atmosphere and great service.

30,"Been there last night. The staff was very friendly and overall the service was excellent. Unfortunately the food was not up to my expectations. I ordered the moondogs burger. Even thought the burger was fine the fries were not. It was like they fried them again. Anyway as far as the price is concerned, food was reasonably charged but i cannot say the same for the drinks.

30,"This was our 1st visit to Moondog's, along with friends who have been there before and recommended it for its burgers and atmosphere.Well, they were spot on for the food. The red hot chilli burger was fantastic and cooked exactly as it should do! The selection of beers was wide and the whole setting very enjoyable.The service however did not so justice to the place as we had to ask 5 different waiters more than 1 time each, for our drinks to be served. So much so that the food arrived before our drinks! This is the main reason of marking down an otherwise very nice experience.We will be going back, if only to check if this was a one off.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

The dish with wings ,ribs, and sausage was fresh ant tasty, completeted with fresh salad.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
20,"Well, I used to like this place. Large selection of beer and nice food. But we went there yesterday noon for the burger week. We were seated outside and it was soon hot. There were only 2 fans blowing at specific tables (a total of over 10 tables). When we asked if we could be moved inside nobody bothered to check the availability.The menu clearly said that the burgers were all medium to well done unless requested otherwise. Well ours (4 burgers) were all well done to really well done and the veggie burger was almost raw...There was also a competition for a trip and tickets to a concert but the waiter didn't bother to bring us the coupon to complete and take part.Overall the food was medium and the waiters' attitude a bit rude to be honest.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Very tasty burgers, for me this is the best burger I have tasted in Nicosia so far. A great variety of beers. Do not forget to taste the grilled vegetables as a side order for your burger and you will love them.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

50,"Fantastic place, me and my wife love it. An original American style sports bar with Excellent menu and an endless selection of favorite and craft beers . The food in particular is creative enough to differentiate from the generic takes on favorite classics but yet simple enough to avoid alienating tastes .i particularly recommend their seafood Risotto , or any from their wide choice of burgers. Also a personal favorite lunch choice is the Rockarolla Salad, pair that with a chilled blonde beer from the hundred's available and you are good o go for the rest of a challenging day. Being a casual dinner with the family, an after work drink with colleagues or a champions league night with the lads , this place is a staple in our choices and never disappoints.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

30,I am the kind of person who really digs beer bars and Moondog's is one of those that has a big list and a decent food menu but it is above all a sports bar and that ain't for me. I guess if you are a sports fanatic and like good beer this is the place to be in Nicosia but if all you want to do is relax and drink some wonderful IPA's this ain't that. Very noisy because of its popularity on a daily basis.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,A bit overrated. It is actually a pub that serves good food and a bit expensive drinks. Difficult to book when there is a match on.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,The food was good however in our large group we had wrong orders and undercooked and overcooked food. it was busy as football was on so perhaps the reason why service was not up to standard.

50,"very close to city center, the place is often fully reserved. Offers wide variety of drinks and food.Jorge and another female staff of the restaurants are the best ones.

50,"Great food, great service from the staff, an amazing selection of beers either on tap or bottled beers. Highly recomended for either a business lunch or meeting friends and colleagues after work. Live music on a regular basis. Need to book a head i would say it gets busy.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,Had a great lunch woth family and friends. Burgers have great quality and portions are big enough. If you have 3 or more kiddies make sure to order the mini burgers starter (6mini burgers and fries) instead of individual ones!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Went there with my wife and my little son. The people were very friendly and helpful.We ordered a platter of potatoes among others and i like the sauces that came with.We also ordered the grilled manouri salad, we didnt like the grilled vegetables mixed wit the fresh.Overall the food was great and the price logical.It's a place that i'll visit again for sure.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Went for a relaxing evening out with friends, who had already been to Moondog's. Loved the burgers and selection of beer. What I loved the most though was the service. Not many places in Cyprus show they know about customer service, and here they do. One of the burgers was over-cooked (not to the punter's liking) and they replaced it, apologised repeatedly and treated our friend to a free dessert! That's how you turn-around a mistake. Other establishments in Cyprus please take note.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Been there a while ago, after a long day at work, looking somewhere to have a decent meal and a cold beer with my colleague . I ordered the MOONDOG‚ÄôS BURGER and i enjoyed every bite of it. As it come to beverage i struggled to choose a beer since they have a huge selection of imported beers from all over the world. For sure i will go back to have the Moondog experience again.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"We booked and went on a busy Friday night and expected to be kept waiting, we were sat dwn with a menu and a drink very quickly, we ordered a platter for 4 as a starter and t was amazing, amongst other things,beautfully cooked kebabs, wings and ribs, we were stuffed! Our burgers came, all cooked to perfection, we (4 working guys) all struggled to get through them, if they weren't so good we would have given up, all through the food we were kept topped up with beers, of which they have an amazing selection, when eventually",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Very popular place, so make sure you book if you're a party of more than 4... Food is great...portions are quite large.... Personnel are very friendly.... Music is good too (just be careful you don't go on a night when the local football team are playing, as it's a sports bar.. And the music stops while the football is on :( )",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"if you want a juicy, big, american burger this is the place to go. Value for money, great food, excellent pub atmoshere, hip, great location, near parking, recommended for birthday partys, reunions etc",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Am definitely going back. Good atmosphere. Service very polite. Varied menu which made choosing tough. Opted for pork chop. Beautifully cooked, succulent and v tasty. Oh, and huge! Great selection of beers from around the world, inc some Belgian classics. And the single malt collection had a lot to keep you interested. All that and the blues playing in the background.Good shizzle",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,Very nice quality and quantity of food. A lot of choises of burgers. Tried the American one. Polite personel. Good service.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,First time here and I left the place with good impressions. Food is good (definitely cannot say that this is the best) but we enjoyed it very much. Beef quesadillas as a starter was nice but beef was a bit chewy. Chicken Fajitas & Chicken Granada were also good. Chicken Fajitas was better than the other one. Portions were good and the beers we had super! Prices are reasonable but imported beers can't be consider a good value especially if you are planning to spend the evening there and consume a couple of bottles. The personnel was friendly and service quick. Atmosphere is cosy and relaxing especially if you choose to sit inside. I would definitely go back to try more things from the menu!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"We be been here twice with my husband and son. The first time we have ordered burgers and those were nicely presented and fine in taste. The second time it was on a Sunday. I do not know, may be the chef was on leave. I have ordered a steak with mashed potatoes. I think that was one of the worst steaks I ever had. No taste at all, just meat. The potatoes were also tasteless just mashed potatoes. As for the salad that was a few greens with 5 small overripe tomatoes. And that plate cost ‚Ç¨19. My son ordered barbecue spare ribs, but the quantity was too small. The atmosphere though is good. So if you go there have a burgers.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"My wife, my son 4 years old and i went here last saturday. We ordered big jack dady burger,griled calamari and mini nuggets for my son. Burger was veryy very tasty. My son enjoyed the atmosphere also. This was second time that had been here. The best burger in the island.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Loved the sausage platter. That was a treat! And the beer we had had cherry flavour and tasted awsome too. :),Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,The burgers here are really good but there is very little service. Very late to come to take order and then to bring food and drinks. Its a pity as the food is very good and atmosphere is nice.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Fantastic place! You can enjoy a wide range of beer, tasteful burgers while watching soccer. I recommend visit Moondog's with family or friends or even for special occasions!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Moondog's Bar & Grill is a nice place.The quality of foods (specially burgers) is high and totally worth the money.Drinks might not be cheap but there is a large variety of things to drink and the service is so good that it can be forgiven.Avoid if there is a football match and you are not a football fan however.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Visited Moondogs for the second time and it was even better than the first. Loved the friendly service and the drinks and food were great. Crowd was nice and the atmosphere really cozy. Maybe the best bar/restaurant in town,Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"The food is ok, average in terms of bar / pub food. Service was ok although the food took some time. Overall Ok but nothing special.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Its just perfect. Staff friendly and environment very nice and western. The foods are in big portions and with good prices. If you want to eat american/western food you must come here,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"I had my first drink in 1974, and this is far and away the best bar of it's kind I've visited anywhere throughout the World. We were made to feel so welcome by the very attentive staff. The quality of bar food was high, with enormous portions at reasonable prices. We watched Ireland beat France in the RWC and it's a measure of the quality of this venue that I enjoyed it just as much as when I saw an earlier game at Wembley Stadium. This is the Wembley for televised sport in Cyprus.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,Tasty burgers. A vast variety of beers. Lovely ambiance. Friendly staff. Pricy compared to similar pubs.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,quantity and portions are good but price wise and quality wise its not compared to others in town. tried this place twice and twice dissapointed. seems to be famous with many so its likely to get invited there at some point in time.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Have tried many dishes and they are all excellent!!!! The burgers are the highlight though. As far as the beer goes... you will have a hard time to chose!!! Not a bad problem to have. Highly highly recommended !!!!!!! Certainly will visit again!!!!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,I was there with a group of friends for a farewell drink and snacks so didn't have a whole meal but drinks were cold and service was great!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Before to order we considered it as expensive but at the end deserved the money! The same quality and portion I 've experienced it in Vegas at Caesar palace. Next time I will visit the place for dine in. Recommended for sure!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"A very nice sporta pub to watch sport events at excellent environment. Not as casual as one thinks but not porschy at all, which is good for watching sports. Nice food as well and good prices",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"Comparing with other ""burger-oriented"" restaurants in Nicosia, Moondog's was rather a disappointment... Poor relation between quality-price, even though the quantity was ok.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"First I will start off with the atmosphere. Loved it! Good music! Good bar atmosphere. Second, the food... meh. Could have been so much better. The food didn't taste fresh except for the grilled vegetables. We ordered the rib-eyes which were very bland. No seasoning and doubt it was put on a grill (no grill marks) but it was cooked perfectly at medium rare. We ordered it with pepper sauce. The sauce did not not taste fresh or ""home made"". Tastes like something that was opened from a jar or can. Ordered the chicken wings as a starter. They were okay except for the hot sauce. Tasted like the hot sauce had sugar in it. No, we probably will not be going back to this restaurant. To sum it up, taste like something a fast food service restaurant would serve. For the price... it was overpriced for the taste of food. We look for restaurants that serve all fresh, quality food.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Perfect food, variety of different kind of beer, great atmosphier, one of the best places not only in Nicosia but even in Cyprus. Very good place to spend with friends.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
10,their is a lot places in nicosia is better than this place i try it before with a friends and it was a big mistake to go their the food was cold the service it was good but expensive for this food and drinks,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"One of the best places in Nicosia. The quality of the food is exceptional and with mind-blowing variety of beers to choose from there is not much that could go wrong. The starters are huge and tasty, and their burgers are THE burgers. Love their new additions to the menu, the Guinness Burger is simply mouth watering. The staff is friendly and helpful and the prices are reasonable. One little suggestion is to change the buns they use for their burgers. Those cheap McDonalds buns you buy from the bakery are not suitable for such a guality burger. Nevertheless going there is a must. Definitely recommended.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,whenever I visit moondog I have a huge problem; i can never decide which beer to order. their vast variety from across the globe is so overwhelming and covers all sorts of tastes whether you wish a brown or blonde or a fruit beer they will have you covered.. The food is also great and complements the beers perfectly,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Was nice, tasty, good atmosphere. the best curly French fries ever. The service was hospitable, good music, hamburger and fun beer.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"I‚Äô ve been talking a lot of times about quality, and how quality creates brands. I know you all have been at least once to a bar. What was the overall quality you received? and what actually did you expect before you visit them?I have recently visited a Moondog‚Äôs Bar & Grill in Nicosia and I wanted to share my experience with you. My personal expectations are not high when visiting a bar, I am actually expecting to get an average customer service, where at the same time I would love to get something more than the average.Customer experience is the most important part in the process of building a valuable brand. What I have been experienced at Moondog‚Äôs was over and above my expectations.Starting from the staff who are polite, smiley and kind with people and moving on to the owner Marios, who really leads the team and they manage all together provide a high standard quality of service. We have been well explained and informed about the menu, we almost knew what to expect in our plates, and as we wanted to have some beers as well we asked them what kind of beers do they offer. Well, Marios (the owner) gave us a detailed description of the types of beers, no no no‚Ä¶ he actually educated us on the types and the differences of each one, we actually felt like becoming experts on beers!Let‚Äôs see each point of customer‚Äôs experience offered by Moondog‚Äôs.The first approachWe have been nicely welcomed, felt at home from the very first moment until the time we have been seated. The environment of the bar, the smile and welcoming approach of the staff, and the personal approach from the owner took place from the very first moment.Ordering the foodWe have been explained on every detail of the cooking procedure of each item on the menu we asked for, so we know what to expect. But what do you think? That was not even the truth.. we have been served an even higher quality and taste than what we actually expect. Again over our expectations.Ordering the beersWe asked about the beers. The answer was simple. Marios said ‚Äúwe only have 110 available beers for you‚Äù. Imagine, we got confused immediately, until the next moment where Marios started explaining about the types and asked us with which type of beer we would like to go for. Then he started questions about the alcohol volume and he finally guided us through the night, explaining why he brings the different beers in that sequence, which was again over my expectations.PeoplePeople in Moondog‚Äôs are well educated to provide a high quality service to their customers. They make you feel at home, and they serve you nicely and polite. They did nothing to make us feel unsatisfied. Everything was perfect.LeadershipI think all the above are taking place because of the leadership skills of the owner. Marios respects the staff, and he is actually involved in the service experience, and on serving customers. They all work as a team, and I felt that there is a special relationship between the owner and the staff.The resultAll my experience with Moondog‚Äôs Bar & Grill was such, that from the very first moment I felt so nice in that place, I have been served and treated nicely, I have been guided and helped on all my decisions on my order and at the end I got my present. A nice cap which I am already using as I have no problem showing that brand to the people.Actually not only that, I am constantly talking to everyone about that place, and I see that people are more than willing to visit it at least once to try.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"A group of friends and I visited this pub last night to watch the football game and to try the burgers. The food was indeed as good as we have heard (juicy meat, fresh ingredients, big portions) and the prices very reasonable.. The service was relatively quick, given the fact that it was a very busy night. I would like to visit it again to try more of the dishes.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"The guys at Moondog's really know what they are doing. They put their heart and soul and finally created a place that we, sports and beer fanatics-possibly alcoholics, can finally call home. Its the music, the huge beer/whiskey etc menu, the food menu that covers every unhealthy craving (or not) you might have, the TV screens showing sports from all over the world, the pool table, the hardcore bartenders and the burgers...oh...you have to try those burgers!!! Thanks guys!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"From my point of view BEST place in Nicosia: great friendly atmosphere, most probably best burgers on the island, huge variety of beers from all around the world, perfect service and all of that is followed by brilliant choice of music!Highly recommended to go out with friends! Love that place, will come back for sure soon :)",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,By far the best Bar Restaurant in town. Great food with excellent service at very reasonable prices. Very impressed !! Highly recommended for day and night. Certainly will visit again and try more of the great variety of food and drinks.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"I visited Moondog's with my husband Atmosphere and decoration are great. It has a huge selection of beers. The night we've been there was live music. Service and staff were very good. Food was quality. Prices were reasonable.The only negative was that,I ordered a burger with no tomato and it came with tomato.The other food selections we made luckily were okay!We had a nice time! Recommended!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,From the moment we arrived the staff has been very friendly. The menu offered many choices at reasonable prices and the order was served correctly and pretty fast. This is a place I would visit again as I would like to try most items on the menu!,Moondog's Bar & Grill

50,"Fantastic burgers, we had 5 different burgers at Moondog's and everyone was happy! The atmosphere we fun and very suitable for a burger place. Definitely recommendable!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Many people thing of pubs as a place forbidden for children. This pub is friendly for children and infants. We visit the place to enjoy the best Burger in the city accompanied with a cold beer. The pub has a very good selection of beers that you cannot buy at a supermarket. Each beer is offered in the correct glass/chalice etc. We have an 1 year old boy that has a good time each time we go. They offer 3 meals for children and the people there are very friendly and come to play with him. They also have high chairs.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Went there on a Friday night, the place has a great vibe it was really busy, but the service was really fast and staff very friendly.My partner and I both had a salad each they were huge and very tasty. I had the Japanese Sea and my partner had a Roca Rolla Beef salad. They have a live bad on some days and the music playing in the background was great. Would definitely be back to try loads of other yummy things on their menu. Along with a large bottle of water we paid 25 Euros.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

40,"very good choice of varied foods, large portions, great selection of imported beers, shows all major sports events around the world",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"This place is basically one of a kind. It offers an incredible variety of beers that I haven't seen anywhere else on the island, along with excellent food. If you feel like having steak/burgers or something along those lines, with a beer and to listen to live music or watch a football game, then this is the place to check out.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Had a lovely evening during burger week! A wide selection of burgers (delicious) and beers! Very friendly service too..Highly recommended!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"Although one of the busiest places in town at the moment, the night we went it was half empty.The food was good, good burgers but nothing special, but the staff could not be bothered to come back to the table to see if you needed another drink and when they did, they took 15 minutes to bring them.They really need to up their service.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Great food ar great prices. Drinks a bit more expensive, as expected at these places. Good service too. Highly recommended.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Very good quality pub food, burgers, souvlaki, salads lots to choose from. Friendly bunch of waiters as though we have been going for years and it was my first visit. Rock music in the background old and new that got our heads nodding. Great place for watching sports with screens all around. Would definitely go again.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"I am a regular at Moondogs and it never disappoints. When you need a cold beer and finger food this is the perfect place. I tried their platters many times but everyone kept saying I should try their burgers. I went there during the Burger Week as I thought there is no better week to try their burger! I decided to go during lunch time when its less crowded and I would get the chance to enjoy a burger as it should be enjoyed, medium! That is where the 4 stars come in. I ordered the Thunderstruck, 3 patties with bacon, egg and onion rings. Unfortunately it was not medium cooked but well done, even though we strictly asked for all our burgers to be medium cooked. My first burger experience in Moondogs was not what I expected, the meal was very good but not the way I asked for, the meat was so cooked that it lost its beef flavor and aromas. I will return again but only for the platters and the great variety of cold beers!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Objectively speaking, I cannot think of a place in Cyprus with better sports viewing experience (both in terms of options, set up, atmosphere etc). Very good bar food, big portions, huge selection of beers, good service, and very unique decoration/ambiance, especially for people who appreciate American sports and rock music. Some great live performances by local rock bands as well. Even though biased in a number of ways, for what it's worth I believe people will not regret visiting this place.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"it was the first place i've been to cyprus for dinner following a six-month journey to eastern europe and middle east with my bike. it was there where i met for the first time my true eternal love, christy deaf from glascow.it was there where we danced until the live band left.. so i will never forget this place anyway. by the way, the food and service were great.especially the tastefull burgers and the cool cocktails!the only thing i could suggest is some beer brands from scotland! :) keep up the good work lads!!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"I often go to Moondog's on my weekends, especially if there is a match on, as they have many screens, play English commentary and the place is great.A really exhaustive beer menu, with good draught and many, many bottle options, especially from Belgium.I love coming here, they make you feel right at home.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,Went for the champions league final. Wide variety of beers to choose from as well as food although food was quite on the greasy side for me. Salad I ordered had too much dressing on (the name was roco loco beef if I remember correctly) and sausages we ordered were dripping with oil.Although the beef in the salad was cooked perfectly.They had projectors showing the football but was not HD which kind of ruined the experience.Other than that the service(waiters) was perfect.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,"Visited the place for a sport event night and I can honestly say that this place has a real pub atmosphere, fantastic beer selection and good service. I visited the place on other occasions as well and they play great music. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for their food quality. Average at the most. We had wings and burger which is highly promoted from the establishment. Visit the place for drinks, atmosphere and to have a good time but skip the food.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,I have seen this bar at the top of trip advisor and decided to visit.I went for lunch with my family and quiet enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection of food. I at least I had a decent burger that was made with fresh mincemeat and not frozen as most bars do.Waiters were friendly polite and helpfulThe selection of local and beer alone will keep me going there to try each and everyone.A lot of detail has gone in to the design and atmosphere of the bar.The only downside were the toilets. I won't say they where dirty because with the low light it was difficult to see but they don't reflect the rest of the bar. One small toilet for either men and women at a bar is not enough. Walls where damaged and you can see the neglect. Most customers where using the handicap toilet instead which says a lot.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"I really was between a rating of 4/5-5/5 but decided to give it a 5 because the atmosphere in this restaurant prevails. I would have given it a 4.5/5 rating if that was available.5/5 for the atmosphere and the arrangement of the tables and the bar indoors and outdoors as well as the service. There are many TV screens inside and outside, a very big one outside which is ideal for watching sports with friends. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere inviting.4/5 for food and the pricing. There are not so many non-alcoholic drinks to choose from and most platters and some drinks are overpriced.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Moondog's is a great place with an easy-going and friendly environment. I really enjoy the various live band events it hosts from time to time. It has a big variety of food and beer - I recommend the burgers with twister fries and the buffalo wings.,Moondog's Bar & Grill

50,"We wanted to check the fast rising restaurant; and we checked all reviews and the menu; we were not sure it would be as good for lunch as for dinner with all the entertainment and nice ambiance at night.We made the reservation; the nice surprises started at the entrance; beautiful house very nicely decorated; warm reception, and very relaxing and elegant outdoor seating.The service was superb with a great smile; the menu was full of great variety; but we were ready to order as we checked the menu before coming to the restaurant; although the menu was changed a bit. The orders started to arrive very fast; we were very surprised with the huge portions; each starter could have been enough for lunch.We enjoyed the delicious Bavarian Platter, the Nachos, and the great curly Potatoes, all coming with a generous variety of sauces. The entrees; the grilled Salmon and the Fillet Steak were also Tasty and cooked to our liking; the Grilled Vegetables and the Fried Rice were so delicious.Prices are very low compared to the quantity and quality of food; we couldn't try the Dessert as we were already full.We will certainly revisit this great restaurant to try the rest of the dishes, but we will not be able to resist reordering the Bavarian Sausages and the Curley Potatoes.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"This my second time that i have been at moondogs, and i was very lucky because i taste a dish from their new menu. Both me and my wife ordered the guiness burger as we are fans of the quiness beer. It was really amazing!!! The burger was very juicy and at a real medium well cooked.

You can sit on the bar, a stool or at the restaurant like area behind the bar especially if you are not there to watch sports. Outside is ok(for smokers should be great). Food is average. Safest choice is the Beef Burger. I would expect more from appetizers. Good collection of imported beers but very high prices.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Really a perfect place. Perfect ambiance, atmosphere, high quality beers and probably the best food in all pubs in Cyprus. My wife ordered a rib-eye steak medium and it was the first time in a pub that it was cooked perfect just like she likes. I ordered chicken kebab. Just delicious!! It was marinated and very juicy. Overall is a great experience for each one to visit Moondogs grill bar for each case( birthdays, anniversaries e.t.c)",Moondog's Bar & Grill
20,"Having seen the no.1 rating on TripAdvisor my wife and I set out for a birthday meal with great expectations. What a disappointment! Ambiance - excellent, Beer - very good. Food ... my wife asked for her Salmon portion to be cooked medium, it came overcooked. I asked for the Phily Cheese Steak, which is (usually) a wrap with Steak, Cheese, Caramelised Onions, and Bell Peppers, and is delicious. What was delivered had a nice piece of Steak, no sign of Cheese or Peppers that I could see, fried onions and cabbage and carrots, in a Ciabatta. Awful.I did not try the Burger, but I have to say the best I've had in Cyprus is at the Good Food Co. on 28th October in Makedonitissa, about half the price of Moondog's, but no beer!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
20,"We went there tonight for my husband's birthday. I had read all of the glowing 5-star reviews and thought this has got to be good. The wait staff were ok, but could have smiled more. My husband's Philly cheese-steak sandwhich was not very warm, had hardly any cheese and included shredded cabbage and carrot, which is not expected. I ordered the maple, mustard glaze salmon fillet, and I asked for it to be medium. The portion they gave me was overcooked and the grilled vegetables were obviously fried. The place screams 'franchise' and I cannot imagine how this place will last. Marzano's is so much better!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,One of the best places in town! Amazing food! Must try moondogs burger and philly cheese steak! More than 100 beers to try! Screens all over the place to watch anything you want! Friendly people! Keep up the good work guys!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Living in nicosia I have found that great pubs and bars are hard to come by, so I was pleasantly surprised when I visited moon dogs.recommended by a buddy of mine, It was one of the best pubs I have been too in cyprus.

50,"Been here quite a few times now, and have never been disappointed.Great beers, great food, and plenty sport on TV.I cannot fault anything here - if anything, the food is too generous - don't over order, because they really give a big portion (I couldn't finish one of the burgers, and I've seen and heard others w/ the same ""problem"")Recommend the mexican fajitas - really the ideal sized meal w/ the beer.Also, have often wanted to watch rugby, or nfl etc, and they will happily find a TV and put it on.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Great atmosphere with good music and the best burgers in town! ps.ask from Mario the owner to get you a shot of homemade zivavia you will love it!,Moondog's Bar & Grill

50,"Very nice American Bar, big selection of beers and very tasty food. Helpful service and friendly staff. I like the pool room with a nice decoration.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,I went here with friends on karnavalia night.The place is casual with nice choices of rock music playing and the food was surprisingly good.Great selection of beer.I will visit again soon.The only issue we had was the cleanness of the bathfoom but hopefully it was an isolated incident.,Moondog's Bar & Grill

50,Great place for every time of the day. Enjoy the selection of beers and maybe the best Burger ever. Great Service and good people working. Moondog's win the Stoli award of the most original Pub in Cyprus You must visit this place,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Very nice food and quality. Great and quick service, definitely coming backs soon......................",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"I go to Moondog‚Äôs at least a few times per month, and with good reason. Firstly the food, both quality-wise and quantity-wise, is awesome. And although a lot of people here have mentioned this, I will repeat it: The burgers are a must try!!! And there is also a huge selection of beers from all over the world.Then, there‚Äôs the sports bar element. The place is set up nicely as a sports bar. There are large TVs and projectors all over the place so you have an unobstructed view of the game wherever you are seated. If you happen to go during the summer, make sure you check out the huge projector in the back yard.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it is obvious that the people running the place love what they do. As the title of my review says, Moondog‚Äôs is more than just a bar. And that is because it doesn‚Äôt play it safe by just trying to be a great bar (which it is). Instead, the people there are always active and keep the agenda diversified by organizing many great events. From live band performances to themed parties and, more recently, a beer tasting event and a Christmas charity event. And I think that it is important to mention that the staff is always friendly and treat customers with respect, making them feel like home. It‚Äôs no accident that Moondog‚Äôs has just received the Original Pub Award at the 2014 Stoli Original Bar & Club Awards.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"A great bar for hanging out with friends, watch any kind of sports' events, food etc. I usually visit this place once a week. It has a great atmosphere, large selection of beers and delicious food (especially burgers!)! The staff and managers are always kind and treat you like a good friend! Highly recommended for any occasion.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Great place, great food, a big variety of beers and wines, quick service, polite waiters with a big smile on their faces everytime! You can watch all the football matches or play pool in such a pleasant environment! Loved it since the day 1.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,I'm a regular @ MD whenever I want to watch my sports or hang out with friends for beer & pool along with timeless rock music . Excellent choice for true American Burgers (must try!) as well as other great food choices! Last but not least....heaven for Beer Lovers!!!! If possible try going when live bands are hosted there.....Awesome experience!!!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Sports bar, rock bar, whatever you are after you can find it here.Cool place at the heart of Nicosia, inspiring decoration with sport and rock music memorabilia, great food, amazing beer selection, warm welcoming and good service, plenty of screens to watch any sport you fancy, pool table, excellent playlists as well as live rock music bands every now and then, complete the scene for the coolest bar in the capital.Great job guys, keep going.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"My hosts from Cyprus took me to this superb restaurant the food was well presented and was hot and very tasty ,tasted the local Cyprus wine not a great taste but it was ok , my ribs just fell off the bone would recommend to anyone to visit this bar",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"We tried this place because it was ranked 3 in Nicosia on Tripadviser, and we weren't disappointed. We have visited several times now. The atmosphere is friendly - a pub which does excellent food. My wife would certainly recommend the mussels - a half portion is a large plate of half a kilo in a thick white wine sauce, or the whole kalamari. I have the home made burger - it is also very good.The main attraction though, has to be the large selection of bottled beers which are served in their own authentic glasses - just like in Belgium. They may be a little more expensive than local beers, but well worth it for something a little special in the heart of Nicosia.The staff are very friendly. Quiet at lunch time in the week, but very busy at weekends in the evening so reserve a table at least the day before.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Nice ""sports bar"" where you can enjoy good food and also enjoy some sports games. There is a huge list of beers which can satisfy almost everyone. The d√©cor may need some improvement but overall the atmosphere is nice.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"A new restaurant in the town make the difference in food, atmosphere, service and drinks. You will love the variety tastes of burgers, the tasty chicken kebab and the juice spear rips. If you like to try a new flavor of beer this is the place you should be. In combination with very good music, friendly staff and warm atmosphere you can also watch the football match you want. With pleasant company you can have great time and definitely want to go again!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Moondogs is a personal favourite place of mine :) I'm here almost every Saturday for their delicious brunch with my friends - i love their home-made jams and marmalades!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Beautiful decoration, delicious food, more than enough to satisfy your hunger, absolutely perfect service, wherever you look, you see screens! I just love Moondong's!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"We visited Moondogs due to Tripadvisor's critics and we didn't regret it at all. We found friendly people there (both staff and clientele), nice beer selection, good drinks quality, and very good bar food. Music was great also. We were 4 and ordered 3 starters, 2 main dishes and 6 beers (pints) and we payed 80 euros, which was really OK for the quality and the portions provided. Moondogs is higly recommended if you want to have an easy breakout, a nice rock music evening, or to see your favorite sports event.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"I just had the best American Burger with bacon, cheddar cheese and twisted potatoes.Nice place with good atmosphere and good food . The service was perfect, love the blonde waitress and the rasta barman.The barman forgot to panch the nachos we ordered.After all they brought us the nachos, at the end of the night shuffle and Apple pie came to our table.When we ask for the bill the barman says the nachos and the deserts were on the house, and when I ask way? The barman said the nachos I paid for because I made a mistake, and the deserts are on the house for the mistake i have made.Funny place with a good people working there.Moondogs is a place for whiskeys, beer lovers and sports lovers.Love it.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,I really love that place. Nice atmosphere yummy food and a huge selection of beers and whiskey. I love the live music nights :),Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Truly impressive selection of beers, Scotch, and cocktails. The service is infinitely better than any of the other places I've to in Nicosia. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and even gave me a pint on the house! Love the fact that it's an American-themed bar, feels like a home away from home! Portions are very generous and totally worth the price both for quality and quantity.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"I have never been to a place to feel like home in my life.The staff of the bar and the managers they don't trite you like a customer but us a friend.Moondog's is the bar to relax listens to nice music and choose beers (105)from around the world.I always come here to watch my favorite team APOEL.Good work guys, keep rocking",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Let's be systematic.1 Atmosphere - Friendly beyond reason. Seeing the mighty Zilla Project here plays a big part of how pleasant the night was with the great music that went on for hours, the spontaneous jamming that happened later on, the gorgeous good souled people who let go and just danced until the late hours of the night. The place gives a big nod to great musicians, has an impressive layout of great bottles of the good stuff, and an ideal setting for both hanging out, drinking and eating. On top of all this, you get an outdoor area too. There's also a sweetness to the color of the lights - makes the whole place feel very intimate and personal at the same time as well.2 Food, Drinks & ServiceBest burgers on the island, and an impressive selection of the traditional stuff too. It's kind of impressive that a place like this does food at such high quality - we're talking food cooked by pros, and served as if you're in some trendy bar in central Berlin. Impressive, stylish and bold - in presentation, but also in taste. The service is swift and professional, but care was taken to make sure the employees are not your regular part-time robots. They actually enjoy what they do, and are a big part of what makes the atmosphere so friendly and enjoyable.3 The OwnersWhat can I tell you, it's these two great guys who made sure that this bar can welcome anything from a family to a death-metal fan group at the same time. They're guys with a great vibe about them, great sense of honesty and respect, and it is OBVIOUS that they love running their bar. They went out of their way to make sure everyone was having a good time, by having a good time themselves as well as supervising the whole evening.4 ConclusionI've seen my fair share of places to go to, especially after living in London and other big European cities, but...If you're looking for a place to have good simple food, accompanied with great music and a very laid back, yet animating and satisfying vibe - this is the place. I'd take someone on a date here, I'd bring a bunch of friends to hang out, and I'd bring my own parents for a bunch of drinks here. Seriously - I recommend it from the heart, and if you're looking for something different or new to make a regular place, or even if you're just passing through town and you want a place with its own personality and a bar you can rely on - Moondog's is the place to be. I hope that the love of owners of a place like this will one day crush these miserable and overly predictable 'chain' bars and 'cafe' places. Cafe Roman Emperor, and Hard Rock Cafe (read POP)? Take a break! The place for real thinking people, driven by passion is here.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"It's probably the best burger I have tried in Nicosia in both quality and quantity!! The price was ok, 20euro for double burger and a beer! Really good service and very nice American-ish environment! Highly recommended!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Propably the best burger in Nicosia. Combine that with a vast selection of beers and a signifigant amount of screens showing sports... Game On!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"First of all, I've been here before but it was for a beer tasting event and I really wanted to try the regular menu and beers.The beer selection is great and extensive, but the food was amazing.The starter platters were delicious, but the Moondog's burger is seriously the best burger I've ever tasted in Cyprus. It literally melts in your mouth, unless you are one of those people that likes their meat well-done ofcourse. Then I am sorry, but I can't guarantee the same experience.All in all, a nice place to hangout with friends, enjoy your meal and have a nice chat over beer.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
20,Expencive beer and the food didn't taste nice. Cats were walking between the tables. But on the other hand servics was nice.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Big, juicy with cheese, bacon and caramelized onions moondogs burger is one of the best burgers I had. Good beer with plenty of choice, nice and friendly staff. Parking just opposite makes it a great place to have a meal with no fuss. Easy going, relaxed environment and with kids menu. Pool table also there. I will certainly re-visit.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"We stopped over early for some grilled souvlaki and a steak sandwich. Nice quality souvlaki and great draft beer selections. Good, attentive staff and a nice American Rock and Roll ambiance make it a good place for all, especially if you happen to not be a late nighter.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,They told me about the place so i decided to give it a visit. The food was very good and the prices ok!!I ordered two burgers and i have been more that satisfied. The burgers are handmade and really burgers you can see the meat inside and understand what you are eating.Moreover the atmosphere and the place it fits great the menu. Hope to be there very soon.Ps. you have to make a reservation a couple of days before you visit,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"This might be my new favourite spot in town! We came here for an early dinner, between 7-8.This modern American kitchen has it going. We firstly ordered the Grilled Manouri Salad, not shy in cheese, colours and flavours. It was on point, light, great appetite teaser, tasty and healthy.Main courses were steak for hubby and Seafood Spaghetti for me. OMG. Huge portions, fantastic taste, perfectly cooked. Amazing!Thumbs up to the Kitchen! Special point for the friendly staff.WILL BE BACK!(can‚Äôt wait to try their brunch)",Moondog's Bar & Grill

10,Good music and food was fine. However service was slow but the worst thing was that they allow smoking inside- despite Cyprus law banning smoking. Our evening was ruined and we had to leave early because of the number of people smoking inside. Take some responsibility and follow the law and ask people to walk 5 metres and smoke outside instead of polluting the lungs of others,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,Great atmosphere with character. The food is very nice and there is a big selection for the beer lovers. One of the best bars in town,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Had dinner one night. Good service and friendly staff. Great selection of beers and food (burgers, salads, steaks). Good prices too (from 8Eu - 14Eu). Will visit again",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,just went to the 1st beer tasting festival in Cyprus and had a blast! More than a hundred beers to choose from. Learned a few more things about beer to! Highly recommended. Great job and keep it up!!!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"We went on the 3rd and last night of the beer tasting event that was held here.Although it was crowded, we had a very good time. The beer selection was very good (over 100 different beers).The staff did their best to keep up with so many people there. They were serving rolls and burgers all the time and there was a sausage cooking stand.The live music was excellent and it helped set the mood for a very good time there.Although it was our first time there, it will certainly not be the last. We plan to go there soon, so we can try the regular menu and beer selection.Can't wait for the next beer tasting event, though !!!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"On September 2014 I visited Moondogs with my colleagues for afternoon drinks. As I walked in, it felt nice and cosy with the warm lighting and the wood/rustic decoration! We sat in the beautiful yard. Looking at the menu I discovered a huge selection of beers, ciders, cocktails and malt whiskeys, all very reasonably priced.How about these prices cut them in half? Yes we were on happy hour time!!! 17:00-20:00!!! Our cold beers were accompanied with fantastic music. Since then, my colleagues and I choose this place for our Happy Hour drinks after work! Cheers to Happy Hour!PS: Try Moondog‚Äôs combo with your drinks! Highly recommended!PS2: Plenty of parking space opposite Moondogs",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"I've only been in the place once and I believe it was a Sunday evening during a very hot August in Nicosia. We were very hungry and decided to get the sausage platter as well as a burger each. The platter was pretty good, and the burger was solid, although not the best I've had. They have a great selection of beers and most items on the menu looks very appealing. I would definitely go back, but, probably not on a big sporting event, I just like the food :)",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"My favorite place when i want great food or having fun!!! I have been there after work for their happy hour (which is something i recommend) where you get a draft of KEO for 2 euros and watch sports events (last time was showing Lenox - Tyson fight, classic ). I went there for their live bands shows and the vibe was excellent. The food is great and i recommend their burgers which is to die for. Staff is very friendly and are ready to satisfy all your needs but what i was really amazed was the great selection of beers. If you looking for a place to relax, have something to eat or have good time with friends, look no more!!!!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,Great place with excellent food. Very good service from friendly staff and all at reasonable prices. Great atmosphere with beautiful wood trimming throughout the bar. Has plenty of TV's to watch your favorite sport and excellent variety of beers. Easy parking.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"On the way home, we were looking a place for dinner. so we check from tripadvisor :) Was it ok going there with my little girl who is only 1.5 year old? the answer is yes :)) she enjoyed the place. (there was highchair for her and the waitresses were always smiling ) we were sitting outside, I like the food. we will go moondog`s again to try burgers.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Love this place! For their food, the positive vibes, the huge tv screens, the ambiance, the one of a kind decor, the music, the excellent service, the cool location... you name it.. They have it.

We often choose Moondog's to watch sport events. The backyard with the HD projector is my favourite spot to watch soccer games!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
30,When we arrived it was quiet and the bar staff were chatty and fun. It's a lively place and filled quickly and we moved outside to eat. Recommended the burger and asked for medium rare. When it arrived the burger was cold in the middle (raw) and by this time the place was going like a fair and no staff were really interested so I ate the edges of it! Bit disappointing after all the hype about the food there but the chef must have short shifted the burger on the grill! Staff apologetic when they saw what was left and offered some fresh fruit to follow which they didn't charge for but I thought they could have taken the burger off the bill.Still it's a fun place and I'll give it a go again - try harder next time kitchen!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,We visit very often for food and drink. Very friendly staff. The food is great and value for money(choose one of their burger and you ll understand) . The big yard is the perfect place to watch sports and enjoy your meal and drinks. A must place to visit!,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Every time I've gone to Moondogs I've known I was in for a good night! Whether it's the live music or DJs (check listings), the fantastic selection of drinks - whiskey being my choice, top-quality American-style and Mediterranean food, or just hanging out with friends watching a wide range of sporting events, I've always left feeling happy. It can get quite busy at times so book a table if you want a seat - but the outdoor space is fantastic and there's plenty of standing room to mix with friends.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"The food was great, the barwoman made me a cocktail I asked for which was not on the menu and the waitresses were always smiling and very helpful. I especially liked the back garden. I don't believe there is another place in Nicosia like Moondogs. The decor is combination of wood, sports and rock and the music was good.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

40,"Cool place, great music, nice for sport events and for a drink and pool. I really like the service and the atmosphere. If they fix the food quality it could be a cool allday round bar.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"We visited a few times in July 2014 to watch football games..The food is very good, especially the burgers and the sandwiches. The prices for the food are pretty good, however I find the drinks a little bit overpriced.It needs however more work to give the bar a more sports' bar feel..",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"excellent friendly staff and service, great atmosphere ideal place to watch sports due to the many tvs which are all around you! Food there is excellent and the prices are ok. Beer is 4 euros if i am not mistaken. Great place!!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Back in June I had the pleasure of visiting Nicosia for the first time. Even though I am American and would normally not go to an American style sports bar while away, I found myself at Moondogs. I didn't pick the venue but boy am I glad that we went. The staff was friendly. The beers were cold and the variety of beer was amazing. Further we watched the Germany / Ghana game in the cool breeze of the back patio (it was night). I will definitely be back next time that I go to Nicosia.(and the sports memorabilia is fantastic!)",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,I have visited 3 times and I must admit I was happy with the environment the variety of Beers and the good food menu. Friendly and willing stuff.I have tried salads and also a variety they offer for 4 persons when we visited with another couple and I must admit I enjoy it very much. Also I tried their burger which was very very good.I will recommend it for food and drink (beer) and their nice cocktails.,Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"nice relaxing sports bar that offers great quality steak (and i'm usually picky about steak) and buffalo burgers. after trying out various places, i can safely say that Moondogs offers the best burgers in town! went there 3 times so far and would definitely go again",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"Went to Moondog's for the first time totally by chance....and I was SO positively surprised. This is one of the best Rock/Sports bars I've ever been to (and believe me I've tried more than a few throughout the world). This is truly a world class venue.Just couldn't believe the most unique place in Nicosia was not aggressively advertised and never reached my ears. While I did notice some small problems with service, it didn't bother me one bit because the people there were genuine, polite and never defensive with my comments (twice). But the place is SO unique that small problems here and there just go unnoticed.It's obvious that the owners and managers of this place know their Rock music. This is evident from the music they play (from Pearl Jam, Led Zeppelin, Chris Cornell etc) to the overall attitude of the place and the live music events they organise from time to time. And then there's sports. My friends who have studied and lived in the US, always visit Moondog's to watch the American Football games (NFL). I had no idea about the specific sport myself, but it helped me realise that this place covers pretty much ANY sport as long as you ask for it. Perfect viewing experience, numerous TVs, great sound, great burgers, huge variety of beers (60-70 different brands).....what else can one ask forThe most impressive element of this place however, it's the unique decor. In addition to the multiple big-screen televisions, projectors (including a mega-screen of 210 inches) they have some of the most rare and unique rock and sports memorabilia I've ever seen. Being a collector myself, I can tell you that some of the items they have on display must cost over 5,000 Eur per item. Not sure everyone appreciates what they see, but I'm sure true music and sports fans can understand the value of these items. To give you an example, they have on display authentic, framed pictures (or jerseys etc) with original signatures from people like Muhammad Ali, the Beatles, U2, Michael Tyson, Larry Fitzgerald, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Metallica, Scottie Pippen, Drazen Petrovic etc...just to name a few...I don't write reviews for places all that often, but Moondog's totally deserves my vote. SO happy to have found this place....officially my new hang out",Moondog's Bar & Grill
40,"Moondogs is a laid back venue which combines good food at a consistently good quality, friendly service and reasonable prices.A sports bar that is friendly to women as well, ideal for a casual night out, happy hour drinks after work and Sports of all kinds (even open for the Super Bowl final!).The Managers are always there to secure that everything is ok and they are always willing to accommodate your food and sports requests.Love their beer selection, music and the cozy atmosphere!",Moondog's Bar & Grill
50,"We have visited Moondogs for dinner and drinks on 3 or 4 occasions both the indoors and outdoors seating areas. The music was good not too loud but enjoyable. Staff very friendly and polite. Well worth a visit especially for the huge variety of beers and drinks. Moreover we ordered burgers, chicken wings, pasta and nachos and the quality and quantity was excellent and most important the food & drinks were reasonably priced. The place also has lots of big TVs and a huge outdoor HD projector showing sports all day so no matter where you sit you can easily watch a game. Great place . We'd definitely come back.",Moondog's Bar & Grill

Whether you feel like an after work beer with some delicious nachos or a late dinner there is a huge variety of food to pick from and its all super tasty and reasonably priced. The combination of friendly staff and big plasma TV screens for all sports lovers is an added bonus! Highly recommend a visit!",Moondog's Bar & Grill

Huge variety of beers with normal pricing i must say. You can go with casual dressing but what i really liked is that whenever i went there i saw also many people that went for food/drink and not only to watch a specific game (incl women). The only cons i found is the service which it wasnt bad, but it could be better....Overall i recommend it",Moondog's Bar & Grill

Food quality is excellent, their Burgers are excellent and I the Mussels which were so good everyone shared so we ordered more. They have a great beer selection and prices are what you would expect from a Nicosia pub, bottled beers range from ‚Ç¨3 - ‚Ç¨6 and KEO draught is $3.90One small complaint is service, there was none. all the waiters were doing were bringing items to the tables, no clearing, no checking and no recommendations. We were always searching for our waitress and on several occasions had to leave our table to get napkins or plates. If this area is fixed it will be a great place to go out.",Moondog's Bar & Grill
