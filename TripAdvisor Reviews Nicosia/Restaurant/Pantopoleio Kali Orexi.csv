40,"I recomend the place, is a restaurante with Good service and quality Food; with a Good environment inside the restaurant.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Saturday lunch with family. Arrived early before it got too crowded. Very nice and helpful staff. 5-6 choices for the dish if the day and a quite enriched menu.All dishes were tasty, portions quite satisfactory. I didn’t like the beetroot puree that is served with the sea bass. Maybe its because of my taste-like range. I dont know.....",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"A very contemporary feel to this restaurant , where the decor is modern and the dishes often have a fusion feel to them. My tuna steak was exemplary - and our mix of starters were all of the highest standard. It's not a rom antic restaurant, but it is great for eating and for discussion. I will return",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"The restaurant is big, not fussy, plenty of space, feel comfortable. The food is delicious and tasty. the people there are very helpful, pleasant and no delay on service.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,We have been many times to Pantopolio and standard never varies. A bit expensive though but their food is appreciated. Keep it this way.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"We ordered glasses of Petrites white and Vassilikon red plus a bottle of water. Then we had a Rokka salad which was extremely good. Then we had Lavraki, Sifias and a Pork Chop cooked in a delightful sauce. Service was rather slow and the Sifias was not so good. To finish with we had a Couple of Mastiha - very nice and thanks. Cost was €67.94",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I always visit Pantopoleio when I am in Nicosia. Friendly staff/service and solidly good Greek/Meditteranean food. They recently moved from the city center to a suburb, but nothing is really far away in Nicosia. It is a much larger place now with a contemporary design and always packed with people, so better make a reservation. Their menu is concise which I like because it means that their ingredients are fresh, and there are always dishes of the day. I am not much into pork but their pork chop is fantastic. Many years ago I got hooked on their orange creme (portokalokrema) desert. No visit is complete without it.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Second visit for lunch within the last few weeks. Food and service were perfect both times. Highly recommended!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Delicious food cooked with fresh ingredients and attentive service. Greek and cypriot dishes but not as predictable as at some places. Keen to go back.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"I ate here for dinner in September 2019. The restaurant has outdoor seating and I took advantage of that. I walked to the restaurant from the hotel across the street. The staff was attentive and informative.The food is Mediterranean, European, Greek, and vegetarian friendly. I ordered the penne pasta with village sausage and that was excellent and filling. I had a couple of glasses of wine with my meal and the waiter also let me taste what he thought was an excellent white wine. In short, the staff treated me very well and the food was excellent.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"We arrived early for Cypriot eating out, namely 7:30 pm so had no trouble getting a table, The place, though capacious, was filling up by 9 pm, mid week so very popular. The salads were superb, I had the fish which for me, was little underdone, but my friends had meat and found the beef and the pork superb. Their chips looked good but my roast vegetables were perfect. The quality was, overall good, but I thought not up to the price we paid. Its strongest points are being able to sit out and the very attentive staff.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Very nice and pleasant restaurant!!!The waitress was very polite... Brizolakia Tou Kambou witch is pork chops with jacket potato was the dish I select. I did not regret it!! It was wonderful.. The menu had a lot of choices and you wanted to try them all. We taste nearly all the day specialities witch reminded me of my mother’s cooking. All the dishes were specially made!! Congratulations!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I loved this place, not only because of the very nice environment, but also because of the food. The food is really delicious. We ordered from the specialities of the day and tastes were really very good (especially Brizolakia tou kampou). 100% recommended!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"The Pantopoleio team, is a one of a kind team. The chef with his creations and the well mannered and trained staff transfer the restaurant to a mast have eating experience. Highly recommended",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Agreed chef makes this food slightly different. However, it is superb meat served on a wonderful terrace. Great fun with good service.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"Great terrace, good service. The menu is not very adventurous or exciting (minimal fish selection, mostly pork or chicken as main courses. Cypriot and Greek cuisine has more to offer. Many friends rate the restaurant highly; we were less impressed with the food choice though what we had was good if unimaginative.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Wonderfull pleace delıcıous food frıendly welcomeıng People work there we wıll defınetly Come back in our cyprus trip,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,I liked the atmosphere from the first minute I walked inside the restaurant. It's modern and airy. Better location than before. Staff are very polite and attentive and food was really good! I loved the veggie 'keftedes'!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Good atmosphere, always busy , {lots of business lunches}, a bit overpriced. Menu has a good variety plus 'plats de jour'. Good quality, well presented, friendly staff.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,Simple decoration: you feel like you are in a modern cafeteria...! The food was tasty however the presentation needs some improvement. The pork was really tender and tasty but little on the sweet side due to the sauce. I liked the desert cheese cake with Kadayif... the service was excellent and very polite waiters. The prices were average: plates around 10 eur. I recommend the place. To visit.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
20,"Went to this new opening with the remembrance of the previous set up which was by the way good. Very disappointed. Food below average and most of the dishes came cold, the place was lacking warmth. The guys who own the place should look to what originally made the place popular and revisit their new venture.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"The lease ran out in the old location so they moved close to the American Embassy. It’s a larger space, with large frontage to the road which makes it feel spacious and minimal but slightly impersonal and empty. It’s the same chef, so the food was still very good. Definitely worth coming to but perhaps not on a romantic date",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"This place is a modern Greek tavern with nice food, based mainly on meat dishes. Not much variety but tasty choices available. The big hall makes the place little noisy. Good choice for dinner with friends.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,The place is a nice place to enjoy lunch or dinner with family and friends.The menu does not have a lot of options to choose from but they have special dishes everyday.The food actually was interesting and delicious from the start until the end.It was a wonderful experience :),Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"A wonderful experience from beginning to end. Super high quality of the products, perfect cooking and a flawless and friendly service. One of my favourite places to eat at in Nicosia. As a frequent patron I was glad to see that the noise issue was resolved. Overall, an excellent place for any food lover. I will be back!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Although a bit noisy inside, we liked the food and the service was not bad. I can tell, it is not a cheap choice and the dishes did not disappoint.I highly recommend their Graviera with sesame seeds and honey, and I can still remember the Melintzanosalata (aubergine salad). I mostly had salads that evening while my friends had meat dishes –pork chop and steak. Average portions and mentioned average tastes. On the whole, though we enjoyed our dinner outing.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
20,"I visited the restaurant as a friend wanted to celebrate her birthday over there! I always wanted to go and it was my first time in the new place in Egkomi! The enveloped graviera cheese was delicious, the zucchini balls were just ok, we ordered two salads that never came. As for the main dishes i ordered mini hamburgers that were not tasty and portion was small, the pork chops were fine and the portion good! Appart from the food that i was not excited, the loud noise in the restaurant was so annoying! We left with a headache!! I dont know if would go again!!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"It had relocated to being opposite the ‘Altius’ hotel. We arrived at 12.35 and ordered a bottle of Shiraz 2017 by Vlassides which was served quickly. We then ordered as well. The Graviera cheese served hot and tasty came well. Then we had had to wait well over 45 minutes and the sea bass was well presented and tasty, the pork chop was huge but rather fatty and the chips were not well presented and the chicken lemonata was OK but not really excellent. The service was very slow and we complained - they responded by offering coffee and a rather nice cream with oranges - very nice. Total bill was €71.50 for 3 persons but the meal was almost 2 hours and 15 mins.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
10,"I am really sorry, but I will not visit the Restaurant anymore because it is so noisy, even when not all tables are taken and you cannot have a decent conversation with your company.Although we complained about the terrible accustic some time ago nothing changed . Pity!!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
20,"The rocket salad consisted of limp green leaves drowned in oil and sun-dried tomatoes that were inedibly tough. Very disappointing. The spicy cheese (tirokafteri) spread had been kept in the fridge so long that it needed to be cut with a knife. Very disappointing. Pork chop was tough and oily. Very disappointing. The service was very good though! However, I will not visit again if the sound situation is not solved. It is impossible to have a conversation because of the noise. The decor leaves a lot to be desired too... A lot of tables and chairs thrown hickeldy-pickeldy in a large plain space.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
20,"The food was good however it took too long,it was unacceptable as it came after an hour and a half and there wasn’t even that much people .",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"I went there twice in a period of 3 weeks. The first time I would give it a 5 but the second time a 3.5. Service is very good and there are some top dishes: graviera fakelomeni (cheese in a pastry with honey and sesame seeds) and the aubergine salad. But the steak and pork chop were average....overall though, a very good place.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Great food and deserts. Traditional dishes but with gourmet touches. Excellent Polite service! try the dish of the day,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Pantopolio is a very nice restaurant which I use very often both for business lunches and at night with friends. Very tasty food at reasonable prices , very good value !",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Best restaurant in Nicosia. Great food, Contemporary Greek cuisine, always with an interesting twist. A delight to eat there, always busy, must reserve for both lunch and dinner.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Exceptional service, Excellent food. Everything was fresh and just cooked. If you sit inside is a bit noisy.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"The place is quit nicely decorated. We sat outside. The starters (shared) were good, but the main dishes average. The main issue was with the attitude of the employees there, which was somewhat rude and not attentive, since we asked several times if the chicken burger we were given which did not resemble at all either a chicken or a burger (a lump of minced chicken with rice) was a chicken burger and they told us that it was a chicken burger without any further explanation or being interested in finding out how they could improve the dish/if we were happy. Not just one but all of the staff members acted dismissively, and when we tried to split the bill at the end of the meal, again gave attitude and told us it was not ""cool"" to split the bill.Overall average.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"We went there for dinner.We ordered starters ,main and deserts.I would return for the deserts which were amazing!I liked also the pseftokeftedes very much (meatballs without meat).Everybody was happy with the meal.The atmoshere was nice and the service very good and friendly.Its not a cheap restaurant .It was a nice experience!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I visited this restaurant with work colleagues, two of whom were local to Nicosia and recommended this place. The food was magnificent, fresh and very good quality, varied, and very good value (to my eyes, being used to Nordic prices). The restaurant was very loud though (as it is a popular place to go, evidently), so if you are looking for a quiet evening, keep this in mind.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Good service, nice wine, food wise, quality ingredients , the bread was a bit dry, the asparagus with scrambled egg a bit wet and not seasoned. The tiny portion of mushrooms okayish. Three Black Angus steaks and a pork chop excellent.The potato dish was lacking any flavour.Overall nothing special about this place.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,The food and service are excellent. Desserts are really special. A wonderful place to go with friends and family but not a place to go for a quiet dinner and lunch. It gets noisy.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"The only deterrent of this restaurant was the noise outside. Apart from that ,the local specialities were truly exquisite, the service outstanding and deserts very good. What I liked about the menu was it wasn’t over saturated with a million different things to choose from. A limited selection but very good.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Great and quality food made with fresh ingredients! Also has food of the day which is also very tasty! Service is really polite!! Highly recommended.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Went there with a group of friends for lunch on a Saturday. We ordered a salad and 2 starters and a few main dishes. We got a couple of steaks (ribeye) at €25 each, a couple of calamari on rice with spinach, and a couple of macaroni/pasta dishes. Had a bottle of wine and water to accompany. Food was good, above average but not exceptional. The cost was on the high side, coming to about €175, ie more than €23+ per person for ok dishes. Service was slightly slow, but the place was packed, so that was partly justified. A decent place, but definitely on the expensive side.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"This restaurant is a favorite with the locals for tasty, native food and value. The menue is limited to some specialities, service is extraordinary kind.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"This is a great restaurant in the business district and just out of the tourist and shopping areas of town.I had lunch here with some business colleagues. The lunchtime clientele are mainly local businessmen.Food choices are excellent, they have everything from a simple moussaka to steaks and fish. I had a halloumi starter in apricot which was delicious, followed by the best moussaka I have had in Cyprus.Highly recommended and worth going out of your way to eat here if you are in Nicosia.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Excellent food Service could be slow when on peak Excellent staff Fantastic environment Great cuisine and special dishes. The elite of Nicosia is eating here too.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"I've visited for the first time the restaurant during the Christmas holidays. All the starters we had were very good. Unfortunately I had a pork chop that it was covered with fresh cream in order to look gourmet, although it was nothing more than just a very good piece of meat that could be perfect if cooked in a simpler way. Very greasy because of the cream which added nothing to the dish.Not all the times a piece of meet if dunked in cream becomes gourmet",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I went to Pantopoleio with my family during the Christmas holidays and I am pretty sure that it was one of the best restaurants I've been. First of all, the atmosphere is so relaxing, warm and friendly. Looking at the place from outside, it seemed like a small place, but once we got inside and people started to arrive afterwards, it was amazing how this place was so comfortable, maybe it was the arrangement of the tables. Secondly, the service was excellent, very friendly and willing to help straight away. Most importantly, the food was delicious. We had some starters first, they were simply amazing. Then for our main dishes we got the ""dish of the day"" and it was actually jaw dropping, amazing. I never imagined it could be that good. Once we finished we were full but there was nothing left in the plates. It was an amazing experience and we had a great time there, so i would definetly recommend it to anyone. It suits anyone going with friends, family or even for business. Prices are also very good for what this restaurant offers. 5 stars for sure.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Very good greek cuisine, very popular restaurant. Food quality is always very good, as well as service",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Fantastic food. Great service from our waiter Andreas. Amazing deserts chocolate creme Brûlée. Relaxed atmosphere. Sat outside with heaters which was very comfortable. Will for sure become a regular..,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,One of the greatest place I ever been there before. Very tasty food and excellent service. Nicosia is perfect.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"We have visited the restaurant after a little research on Internet. The place is very well decorated and the service quick and very helpful.The plates are very delicious, we order chicken with feta cheese and squid with rice.The prices are not cheap but for the place and the food I believe it is fair.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,My friend in Nicosia brought us here for dinner. Excellent meal in this busy and beautiful restaurant - we were lucky to get a table and the food and service did not disappoint. We had a variety of dishes and they were all good. Lamb chops and pork etc. Daily specials and delicious Cypriot food - recommended.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Went yesterday for lunch with my parents and daughter. The whole experience did not start very well since we did not made a reservation and the waiter decided to explain to me that they had 120 bookings for lunch -which I couldn't care less- and that it would be difficult to accommodate us. In any case they did find a table for us and the waitress (black curly hair) was extremely good which turned the whole experience to positive. The food was ok, the prices reasonable and the portions quite generous.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"One of the best choices for lunch or dinner in Nicosia center, Pantopoleio offers simple Greek cuisine, in a beautiful casual environment. Both pork chop with commandaria sauce and ribeye steak were tender and delicious. Rocket salad with fennel was interesting and starters were all good. Service was friendly and fast.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Simple decorated restaurant Located in Nicosia. One page menu with several different daily platters. The food was tasty and the service was quick and correct. The waiter was pleasant and helpful. I recommend.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Went with 2 old friends for dinner, service was excellent , waiters go beyond norm to explain suggest and help with selections and are very quick to respond. Food is excellent and very different from your standard greek food, nice gourmet twists. All in all a lovely evening.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"A group of five of us had dinner last night. We all chose different meals, from fish, stuffed kalamari, pork chops, meatballs in yogurt sauce and steak. We also ordered a delicious Greek salad, mushrooms cooked in Cumandaria wine and greens.We all liked the taste of our food with the exception of the meatballs with the yogurt sauce, the person who ordered it was not quite impressed. Everything else was absolutely delicious.The service was outstanding, very professional, but friendly at the same time.The atmosphere was very pleasant, but a bit noisy, but of course the place outside was packed. You better make reservations ahead of time.I would go back happily.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Congratulations to the owner/manager as they have managed to find a great balance in this casual yet cool restaurant. The menu is split between new flavours with interesting twists and more traditional food as well. The waiters although casually dressed in Jeans strike the perfect balance between friendly and professional. In particular, the young waitress who served us was excellent.There are a lot of specials of the day, almost as many as the actual menu. The décor is nice with white being the primary look. It attracts both celebrities and “ordinary” people.Everything we had was tasty and the masticha liquer at the end was a nice touch as well as changing of beer glasses to get cold ones after first few beers! Menu was reasonably priced and all staff were polite and made you feel welcome.All and all defiantly worth a visit. Booking is essential. We went on Thursday night and was full. Its open for lunch as well but it’s more of a rush and a business feel to it.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"Nothing special in any of our visits. Average food, limited choices, more sweets on the menu than food, good service. Does not match the ... reputation it has got.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Here you can find rather an unusual menu compared to other Cypriot Restaurants there is often new dishes to be tried the place is very popular and it is recommended to book the Service is good and the prices moderate i will personally like to define the place as a charming Bistro,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Situated in the centre of Nicosia, with a beautiful outside area. Even though there is not a very wide variety of dishes, everything we tried was very tasty and well presented. Excellent service, extremely polite. A parking area is available next to the restaurant. Good value for money. Make sure you make a reservation before going because it is usually full!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I was take to this restaurant for lunch by a business colleague on the 1st of June while in Nicosia for 1 night. It was superb, good food , excellent service and very nice atmosphere . We sat inside because it was rather hot however within 30 minutes the whole place was buzzing it was full inside and outside. The gentleman who's managing the restaurant was always around chatting with his guests and making sure they were happy. I must admit Cypriots are switched on when it comes to service. Overall I enjoyed this restaurant very much and will certainly visit again on my next trip.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"This Greek restaurant is suitable for family, business, couples and solo if one wishes. Excellent quality Greek dishes with a twist that takes them to the next level. The service is of very high standards and the owner is close to the customers. A must visit!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"The food was delicious, nice salads and tender meat. There are also vegetarian options. Friendly service, buzzing atmosphere, hip retro-modern decor. Recommended!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"After a few visits, I would summarize this place as a convenient spot at the outskirts of town center, a variety of daily specials to supplement the standard menu, excellent and helpful service, very organized staff, very good portions, various rich tastes (even the daily menu has a variety of dishes) and prices in the upper normal range; all together make an undoubtedly successful culinary experience.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"I had read here about this place and we tried 3 times to visit it as a couple. It was really imposible! They just never make a reservation for two!I've tried it three times,i even called three days ago and they told me that there was nothing available(on Wednesday evening)!Of course both times we were 5 or 6 we did not have a broblem finding a free table a few hours ago! Anyways, both times the food and the service was good,but nothing memorable. Last time we were 5 people,we got 4 plates(not the ""special ones"", chicken,meatballs,etc),1 salad, 3 starters and 2 (very disappointing) desserts,we drank 2 bottles of a common cypriot white wine and we paid..28 Euros per person! Oh,yes! Not a gourmet,not a tavern,the place is something in between. It is very expensive,with no character. There are definetely many different better choices if you want to go out in Nicosia! Especially if you are willing to spend 55 euro as a couple!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,I was invited from two businessmen to that restaurant I was surprised from the quality of food and the friendly way of the staffDecoration of it is very simple and it gives more impression. Its quality is not from the furniture or decoration but from the taste of same food you may try it hundreds time beforeI recommend if you are in Nicosia it is nice to try. Also it is not expensive,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"An excellent find on a walkabout in central Nicosia.The food was excellent, we had: crushed feta and meatballs to start; and pork belly and chicken skewers for main course.Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for the customer centric staff.It was easy to see why this restaurant was packed, whilst others a stones throw away were sitting empty on a Friday lunch sitting.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,One of the Best tavern in Cyprus i ve ever visited! This is very cozy Greek Modern Tavern with big variety of great delicious dishes and fantastic service! Must Visit!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Nice and beautifull place. Staff is helpfull and polite. The food is expensive comparing with other places, but you can find some ""big fish"" visiting this place. For three adults and one kid payed nearly hundered euro, without filling the stomack up to end, as usually happens at other taverns.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Pantopoleio always has daily specials, which finish early as they are very good. But the a la carte menu is excellent as well, with classical dishes alongside a few with interesting twists. Everything is fresh and home made, and you can find meat dishes as well as vegetarian options (we go there often with my vegetarian sister in law). The restaurant itself is very welcoming indoors, and it has a great terrace when the weather is nice. They bring a small glass of masticha drink at the end, always a welcome digestive! A place we always come back to!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Amazing greek dishes, top service and genuine friendliness, I can't wait to revisit!!! And don't forge to order the lemon creme for dessert",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,I am a very choosy person but the food of this restaurant was above my expectations! Very selective dishes for very demanding customers and I can't hide that I am one of them. Prices are average but I believe you pay what you get!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Quick service, nice food. Really enjoyed one of the 'dishes of the day'! Although the restaurant was full the service was very good. Highly recommend.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Pantopoleio really stands out because of the great food. Traditional dishes prepared very creatively, with excellent quality ingredients and presented always in most a delightful way. Very good service from people who love what they do, good wine selection, prices on the high side, deservedly so. Only issue, always crowded, occasionally noisy.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"What is immediately noticeable is the casual yet sophisticated unintrusive style of the well mannered staff, who upon receiving you start laying a few tidbits of olives and hot peppers and excellent village bread on the table (just as in a traditional taverna), and continue explaining the unusual but novel dishes (no printed menu, everything is chalked on the main wall, serving both as a giant blackboard and a design feature. Frequent changes in the choices guarantee all fresh seasonal produce, but limit quantity so be prepared to go earlier than later).The place itself doesn't boast loud decor or fancy tables and chairs, but sticks to an atmosphere that is reminiscent of old day tavernas only it's freshly coated in white contrasting to the dark black and warm grays of floor and shelving. In general its a cosy taverna setting.Wines are few and decent enough, the food exceptionally well prepared if you like and know Greek cuisine. Overall, an excellent choice between kitchen, ambience and price.I have been already several times, always on the spur of the moment and without having reserved beforehand (but early enough, before the night rush) and noticed the standard always remained high.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Visited the place for a birthday dinner during our vacation in Cyprus and were very satisfied. Modern, creative yet sophisticated ambiente. The staff vere very attentive. Seafood pasta and beef liver were both perfectly cooked and, for us, a very welcome change from the standard ""authentic Cyprus"" tourist cuisine. Gorgeous deserts.From a look at the menu I'd say they mostly do modern interpretations of traditional Cyprus dishes. Not a cheap place, but certainly worth the money.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Lovely and lively place. Good Greek food prepared with care and good ingredients. Simple menu that changes seasonally. Central but also in a quiet location with ample parking.The crowd here is loyal and regular and the staff friendly and responsiveGood for kids as well,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"We went there for business lunch. Attentive staff, food well cooked. Traditional local dishes, nice ambience. A pleasant surprise in the center of Nicosia. Although mostly business people, a mixed crowd, students as well as retired ladies meeting for lunch drinking wine. We ll be returning definitely to try to test more dishes from the menu.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Always excellent cuisine High standards service and food Friendly and nice decoration as very friendly personnel Clean and nice design,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Excellent food, quality is consistent! I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant -but make sure you have a table outside -as it can be extremely noisy inside, due to the acoustics /choice of materials... Reserve well in advance!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Excellent food, Cypriot and Greek cuisine, very tasty starters and big main dishes portions. Nice desserts as well, the orange pie to be recommended and service very good, polite waiters!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Fresh, wholesome food, excellent service in a warm, friendly environment. Suitable for all seasons! The one place where vegetables are not over cooked! Enjoy!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"very nice set up, excellent service , good food and nice atmosphere, always busy book table before going",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,We were guests at this restaurant as we have been two or three times before. The food has been very good every time and the service has always been excellent. I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to someone who is looking for an authentic Cypriot restaurant with elegance and excellent service. The complimentary Masticha after the meal is a very nice touch.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,We are visiting this restaurant quite frequently. It is consistently very very good. Both in terms of service and quality of food. These days that sitting outside is simply magic because of the weather the restaurant is simply perfect for a casual and relaxing dinner. Highly recommend it.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,Worthy restaurant with Mediterranean cuisine.Excellent service and staff ready to explain and serve you.Tasty dishes.Portions large enough to satisfy the customer. As regards pricing the main dishes are reasonably priced.First dishes expensive.Wine list is short but includes top local etiquettes.Some dust is coming from the nearby parking.Crusher run floor surface in the yard is a problem for ladies.We are going to visit again this place.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,I love this place for lunch. The only serious problem is that the place is so popular that often we cannot find a table for lunch. Excellent food and service. Highly recommended.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"We have been to this restaurant a few times in the last three years and it was always excellent. They cater for the whole family so we had no problem with young children (4 and 7 years). The cheesecake was simply devine! Having lived in several countries in Europe, this cheesecake is up there amongst the top ones!It is also well situated, in a street off a main road not far from the Solomou bus station. So no problem with parking. Service was fast and pleasant. Booking might be a good idea as it gets really busy after 8:30.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"We went for dinner on a Saturday night. Even though the place was very busy, the service was polite, friendly and attentive. The salad with halloumi was fresh and tasty and the meatballs with yoghurt sauce were nice and juicy. The pork chop with fries and the pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes were both cook to perfection and delicious. The penne with sausage was too dry. The lemon tiramisu was refreshing, but did not impress my taste buds. We liked the house wine and the complimentary mastic liqueur served at the end of the meal. Even though in some dishes there is place for improvement, I was impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
20,"Good service, nice atmosphere, food was ok. Small portions, over cooked chicken kebab, nothing special for what is charged.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Excellent quality of food, authentic taste, at an overpriced approach. Coffee and desert could be at least offered on a complimentary basis rather than charged.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi

40,This is where local political and financial people hang out for lunch. Its a nice place with fresh food and the menu is always interesting. Price was its ok not on the cheap side. Make sure to book a table so you won't get disappointed. It can also get windy and dusty if you sit outside.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"One of the bests example of how Cypriot-Mediterranean food can be developed into exciting and modern dishes, coupled with excellent service and reasonable prices Pantopoleio should not be missed if dining in Nicosia.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi

50,Very few restaurants in Cyprus that offer local cuisine where the focus is on QUALITY rather than QUANTITY. Everything they make is great. Always use what is in season so the menu changes frequently. The service is good. Recommend it mainly for business lunch but also good for family.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,excellent modern mediterranean /greek cuisine..food quality never failed us and service is always a pleasure because the personnel are more than just polite waiters...best place in Nicosia..my favourite!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"We arrived about 1 pm on a Tuesday with no reservation. The place was empty. We were shown to a table outside as we were told this was all that was available. Sure enough, by 2pm it was full. Very popular for business lunch.Food was excellent, we had squid special and the courgette tart which was amazing. Very friendly service considering how busy it was.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,This was my 4th visit to this place and I have to admit it gets better every time. It is not your stereo-type Greek-Cypriot cuisine but there's always a touch in its menus that make them that much more interesting.Its salads are unbeatable and there are lots of lovely dishes. If you like liver than try the beef liver on the grill; fantastic.Great choice of wines too and professional service,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Although the place is situated in the heart of busy Nicosia, the owner manages to keep it light and qiuet. Every dish we ordered was cooked with care and knowledge of the materials used. Traditional cheeses are served nicely with a twist. All plates have character but, without overdoing it. All in all, everything was delicious! I definitely recommend this great place!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Super good, great service - pasta with meatballs are super, as are the meat dishes - great selection of starters. Greek cuisine with a twist. Highly recommended.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
20,"Everything was awful except the service. High prices for very small portions, nothing special about the taste or the presentation of the plates.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"The restaurant seem famous among administration people in Nicosia for lunch at least so reservation is a must. Closed to Cyprus museum and Leventis Art Gallery, for tourists. Looks modern, it's pretty clean and the food was amazing. Look beside the menu for the daily specials as they are the Crown Jewels. Moussaka was amazing, salads, desserts, everything was delicious all four times I haven been there... Service is great, by the way and prices extremely reasonable.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I have visited this place several times so far, and can not find something bad, or something not good so that will keep me away of this place. On the opposite side, everything is great, food is delicious and the service is always good.Ill visit again and i advice for the people that haven't visited this place to do so!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,I really enjoy Pantopoleio especially for lunch with business associates. It offers a wide variety of home cooked dishes but also other great greek dishes.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,The food is Greekish with an international flavour. Consistently good it attracts mainly locals for business lunches. Good and speedy service. A good choice.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,We always visit here on our frequent trips to see my parents. The welcome is genuine and friendly from a close knit team of waiters who care passionately about their food. The dishes are variants of Cypriot recipes with fresh ingredients. Outside seating is great in dry weather. THE OCTOPUS IS OUTSTANDING!!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Nice restaurant with really good food.We visited the restaurant with friends (10 people in total) and everybody left satisfied.I personally tested halloumi and graviera (starters), pork chops & chicken souvlaki (main courses) and mastiha macarons (desert) and everything was tasty.The decor is Greek style and the area is nice as even though in the heart of Nicosia it is really quiet, plus there is plenty of parking around so you don't worry where to park.Just for your information the map shows it at wrong location.The address is the same Vasileos Pavlou but at a different location. Next to the old GSP stadium, opposite of the ministry of finance.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"We visited this cute Greek style restaurant for the second time this summer. The food is consistently at high level, well cooked and served fresh. Very polite staff and ready to help you . Nice atmosphere. Highly recommend it.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Glad to see a renewed menu. This simple, modern restaurant is a taverna with a twist. Much loved by locals, and especially enjoyable in summer, with outdoor seating in the evenings. The service is always outstanding!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,This lovely place serves mostly Greek food and it's absolutely delicious. The service is always attentive and the staff very helpful. The prices are reasonable and you can't beat the Greek-taverna ambiance. Recommended!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Being there several times and its consistenly good. The place serves modern greek cusine based on traditional dishes, special note to the service which is professional. A few minutes walk from the city wall but its worth a visit. You will see a few tourists here so if you like mingling with the locals look not further.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I've been coming to Cyprus for years as I have a lot of family here and have been to scores of restaurants. This one is one of the very best.We sat outside in the evening air. It's really on its own in a residential and business area so actually very easy to drive to and park. Watch out the location on TripAdvisor as it was wrong as on 15 June (reported). The correct address is Vasileos Pavlou 7, 1096 Nicosia near the Ministry of Economics and runs off Grigoriou Afxentiou.It's a relaxed, friendly and easy going place with great service. The waiters are super helpful and happy to help with any recommendations. The food is all local with a nod towards a modern twist here or there. The food is perfect - some of the very best I've had here in my several decades of coming to Cyprus. It's meat dishes are beautiful and there is also a good selection of vegetarian dishes.Love love love this restaurant!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I actually delayed my trip to Larnaca just so I could try the food as recommended by a Cypriot blogger. The cooking here is modern Greek with Cypriot touches -- my grilled chicken stuffed with halloumi cheese really showcased the cuisine in this corner of the Mediterranean. Food aside, I imagine it's the atmosphere that draws the crowds. On my weekday visit, the place was packed with officer folk and ladies who lunch. It felt like any bustling, yuppie cafe from Los Angeles to Melbourne, Singapore and everything in the between. Oh, and really nice servers, too, which is always welcome.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"A very nice restaurant hiding behind the old GSP parking space.The menu is short, with limited options, but you are likely to find something you like. I tried the pork chop, which was well cooked and well spiced.The waiters are very friendly, and they were very understanding when we complaint about a dish. In fact, they deducted it from the bill, which was more than we could ask for.Nice food, nice service, nice atmosphere, nice place.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"The food is fresh, prices are reasonable, and waiters are very friendly and rapid. I will go there every day for business lunch:)",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,+++ Super tasty food! +++ reasonable prices! +++ relax and cozy atmosphere! +++ superb service! + next to free parking (Old GSP stadium) + nice yard in the summer,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Excellent food and rich menu for all taste buds. The staff is extremely helpful, positive and eager to satisfy the customer's needs. The food quality and freshness of ingredient cannot be underestimated. Wine list is also very good . Value for money! I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Enjoyed Pantopoleio ever since it opened. And the quality of the food has stayed the same all this time: fresh and high quality ingredients, beautifully prepared, and with authentic Greek flavors. The staff is Greek, attentive, knowledgeable and efficient. And the portokalocrema is to die for!!!! A must for anybody who likes Greek food.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,Its a regular business lunch choice. Food is geeat especially the daily menu. But its very heavy on the stomach each time. It doesnt stop us visiting it over and over again.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Whenever I have a chance to go for business lunch in Nicosia I choose this restaurant, the food is homemade, fresh and realy nice! I usually go for daily menu like salad and fish. The atmosphere is very nice, if it's not too hot it's nice to sit outside. The place gets very busy during lunch but it creates nice atmosphere.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Visited the restaurant for lunch just today.The location is excellent and the outside seating area is great when the weather is good. The inside is a bit small but evenly arranged so that it doesn't feel packed. I am not suire what happens when the outside is not available but i must say what i experienced.Service is excellent. We had no problems or delays ordering or receiving our dishes.Starters look interesting. We chose two of them and a salad. I must say that even though the portions are quite big, the prices for the starters are quite expensive. When only 2 for lunch i suppose there should be an option to order half portions of starters.I got some traditional meatballs with yoghurt sauce and my friend the grilled sea bass.He enjoyed the fish. My dish was a bit flat. I expected more from a traditional meatballs dish. More seasoning, some spice maybe...We also shared the halva with ice cream dessert which was really good.It's a good experience, a bit expensive for what it is so i wouldn't go there quite often for lunch during work breaks.I definately recommend it.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,Nice place with good decorations. The inside is not big and therefore very- very loudly! The tastes were good but not so special that make go again. The portions are very good and fair.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"Is a nice place to go especially if you sit outside. The food is ok, but nothing special. Friendly environment, good staff. I visited the places 3 times and still the same impressions.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,Went here for lunch after a long drive. Left full and happy. Tried the pork chop and stuffed burger ( which was not stuffed but tasty!) Desserts ate great!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Very good service, nice surroundings especially the garden , tasty dishes and the most exquisite portokallokrema (orange taste cream). You definitely need to make a reservation before going there.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"I come here very often for business lunches and i always look forward to the lunch. The place is nice and simple, always fool and food is great! Service is one of the best in Cyprus - very fast, friendly and attentive",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"We went for dinner one lovely evening and generally i was impressed by the quality of service. The waiter's recommendations were very genuine, he wasn't just trying to sell, the way he described each plate made it very clear what each should order. And he was right, the food was delicious! For desert we wanted to order the creme brulee but we also mentioned that we wanted something refreshing so he suggested that we should order the orange cream pie and he was so right! It was the perfect desert for a hot summer night!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,I was in Nicosia for business and out by myself this night. As a typical American I walked up at 730p only to be turned away and told to come back at 830. I was glad I waited. The Greek salad was the best I've ever had! Te rest if the meal was excellent and the Mustika offered at the end of the meal was a perfect was to finish! I would highly recommend this place to anyone. I will be back!!!,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Whenever guests are over for business, this is the place to go. Its great, fresh and daily dishes never disappoint. Its a hidden gem in Nicosia.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"This Restaurant was recommended for making special homemade dishes; we tried to make a reservation; unfortunately the page on Trip Advisor didn’t include much information and no Telephone number to call although it stated Reservations under Dining options. Finally, we found the telephone and called to make reservation.We were lucky that we made the reservation as the Restaurant was fully booked for Saturday lunch. The reception was fine, and although the restaurant was full; the service was great and fast; the waiters were moving like in a beehive.We ordered 3 Starters and 3 Main Courses; they were all unique and delicious; the Stuffed Tomatoes were superb, and the Chicken with Spinach and Prawn Sauce was very tasty; however, the orzo was over cooked.We will certainly visit the Pantopoleio to try the rest of the great unique dishes they offer.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"We have visited that restaurant with some friends. The service was very good, well prepared food with extra touch of unique flavours. On top of that , they have offered us liquer ""masticha"" .",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
30,"First time at this restaurant for lunch. Very good decor, attention to details, nice atmosphere and kind staff. We ordered the chicken with 'moscholemono' and honey and wild rice, and a pork chop with chips and spinach. The pork chop was ok but nothing special, the portion though was very generous. I expected the chicken to be marinated with moscholemono and honey and grilled, but in reality it was boiled chicken topped with a tomato sauce, but no taste of honey or lemon. The wild rice was just untasty which was very disappointing as I love wild rice. I would really like to give it another chance as everything else was very good.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"very good food and good selection of wines. good service, warm people. nice atmosphere. a bit expensive",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,Nice atmosphere both inside and outside. Kind and efficient service. Good quality greek food. Menu now in need of some changes to reflect better the year's seasons.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"We've been to Pantopoleio multiple times since they opened a few years back. The food and service has always been outstanding. The portions are very generous. The atmosphere can get loud but should be no surprise as the place is popular since it is a great place to socialize. The decor is outstanding as well. I'll continue giving 5 stars although I don't like to if an establishment does not have draught beer, but, because Pantopoleio always completes every meal with some exceptional, gratis ice cold house mastich, they get 5 stars. Always a great time at Pantopoleio.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Went there for lunch with friends, and we really enjoyed our meal, albeit with very slow service. Our friend had a limited time, and even though we ordered early, we got our food much later than most patrons. We tried the fava, very tasty, and the ""mpoutakia"" filled chicken thighs with halloumi and bacon! I will try the recipe. Also served with salad with ""glistirida"" a very nice local touch. Overall, slightly slow service, slightly overpriced (the portion of chicken was very small for its price, four half-thighs), but nicely prepared and very polite. Would return.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"Excellent food, great atmosphere especially in the outdoor area. The menu changes twice a year, but favorite dishes are always part of it. Thomas always available to greet and serve his customers.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,This is the place to visit when you miss home-made Cypriot and Greek cuisine. Everything that we tried was made with fresh and seasonal ingredients and tasted delicious. There is an a la carte menu but also dishes of the day. The service was excellent and the members of staff were very polite and extremely helpful! The whole experience reminded us of the taverns/ouzeri in Greece! We will definitely return next time we are in Cyprus.,Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
50,"I really do like this place! I live in this town and every time I go I have a pleasant fulfilling experience. The food is really yummy and fresh. Ingredients and spices are local. Dishes are prepared according to the season's availability. The service is perfect and the owner, Thomas, is a professional. Have dinner or lunch and you will not regret it. Family, business, friends, date...all blend well in a nice loud atmosphere. Try to share dishes.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Visited it on Saturday night. Although it was a bit late (after 11 pm) kitchen was open and we were able to order. Since it is summer we had an outside seating.It is a Greek tavern with good food, good value for money and excellent service.Tip: The mastic liqueur offered courtesy of the shop at the end of the meal is great!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"Having tried all main courses except the steak which run out, best choices for us were the burger and soutzoukakia. Our starters were also very good as was the salad with halloumi. Of the two deserts we tried the yogurt mousse tart was excellent. Service was also very attentive and friendly. Will visit again.",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
40,"I always like the food here. The prices are reasonable, the waiters are friendly. Its great in the summer when you can sit outside. In the winter it can get a bit noisy inside (rather low ceiling). Plain and simple. You cant go wrong!",Pantopoleio Kali Orexi
