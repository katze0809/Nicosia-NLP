50,"Great find as we walked around Nicosia. We ordered a very tasty Meat platter which was accompanied by salad, fries, pitta and dips and they gave us a portion of tasty cous cous, and we drank wine, beer, water and a few shots of Mastiha on the house. We didn‚Äôt manage to eat everything, although we did try!Staff were excellent, friendly and gave great service and we couldn‚Äôt believe the bill only came to ‚Ç¨28! Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We ate here for lunch when visiting Nicosia for the day. It was recommended in our guidebook and I can definitely see why.We ordered a portion (a full plate with two/three skewers, a bit of salad and chips) of pork souvlaki and a portion of the lamb souvlaki. This was comfortably the best grilled meat we have eaten in Cyprus - moist and juicy, accompanied by a dipping sauce matched to the type of meat ordered. We also ordered a side dish of mushrooms, which came with the chimichurri sauce - not a match I would have thought of but it actually worked really well.Aside from the delicious and filling food, what really stood out was the level of service provided. We had our five month old daughter with us and thus is the first place in Cyprus where we have found a changing table in the bathroom. The waiter also helped us get the pram into and out of the restaurant, and the table service was attentive without being over-bearing.A worthwhile place to stop for lunch or dinner when in Nicosia",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visited for lunch during a day sightseeing in the city. Of course places are no 1 for a reason but this one exceeded all expectations. The food we had was amazing the slouvaki both I and my husband had was delicious and up there with the best we have eaten in Cyprus. The service was lovely, friendly and helpful as they offered some suggestions to us for starters etc that we really enjoyed. Make a visit if you are in the city you won't be disappointed!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The vegetarian platter was delicious, even my non-vegetarian friend said so. This Place is nr 1 for a reason üëåüèºüòã",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent, fresh food with beautiful local red wine. Fast and efficient service with a smile. Value for money as the standard is very high. Would definitely come back",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Myself and my partner - visiting the capital on a day trip from Ayia Napa - stopped by here for a late lunch after finishing at the nearby Cyprus Museum. We both shared a couple of Cokes and the vegetarian platter. I don‚Äôt think either of us fully anticipated how generously portioned or out-of-this-world tasty it would be! But oh my goodness was it delicious. Every single ingredient tastes as fresh as you could possibly imagine - the mint has to be freshly picked. Your whole mouth is so happy eating here, and it‚Äôll do wonders for your body, too. The complimentary dessert and shot of ouzo was the icing on the cake - divine. Number 1 on TripAdvisor, and for reasons that are instantly obvious, Piatsa Gourounaki is a must.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Eaten here many times and it‚Äôs consistently good. Portions are big and always fresh and well prepared. Service good.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Love the food, love the efficient, quick and attentive service, Love the location - atmospheric in the old quarter (although opposite the shops are all closed and run down). The food is excellent and generous and easy to top up with extras. The hygiene arrangements and spacing are top notch.You can't reserve so turn up early as we say many people unable to be sat or had to wait. It's really good value and highly highly recommended. We visit Cyprus regularly and always always visit this lovely place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I loved this place. Many things on the menu. You order when you enter and recieve a little buzzer when you pay for your order, the buzzer vibrates when your order is ready. Gets busy sometimes, I will go back on my next visit.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We have visited the restaurant for lunch. The staff was very friendly, the place was very clean and very cool on a very hot day. Every time we visit we get that wow feeling as if it is the first time. The food was very fresh, the meat was very tender and most of all very soft and very tasty.. I can honestly say it is the best restaurant of its kind for value for money...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Food was possibly best we've had so far in Cyprus. Big portions, sorted us for lunch and dinner! Good value. Definitely recommend!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is a basic, traditional Greek Restaurant serving tasty, good value food. Don‚Äôt order too much, the servings are very large . Just order a platter for every 3 persons it's more than enough. If you are still hungry just order some more.This is a like a fast food style restaurant but the food is great.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We choose this restaurant because it is best rated on trip advisor from restaurants in Nicosia and we were not dissapointed. We orderes chicken and lamb souvlaki and it was absolutely the best. If i ever come back to nicosia this is surely the place we will go again. The staff is also very nice. We also got some desert and local spirit on the house. Great experience!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Best Greek food in town, Delicious meals and great service , they offer platters for two and have also vegetarian options!Highly recommended",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Really delicious food and big portions. The chicken platter for two was amazing. Chicken in three different styles, tender and delicious. Definitely not for two but for three persons. They bring a sweet for free in the end. Polite staff.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Arguably the best kebab/fast food restaurant in town. Very good service and the quality is always top,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Friendly service, cool owner, top food. Classic 5/5 stars! Recommend for lunch and dinner with friends or family",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"After Booking an Excursion by Coach to see the Sights of Nicosia, and after looking around some of the places of Interests, we found that we had around an Hour and Half left before our return Pick Up from our dropping off point, and after both stating how peckish we felt,we looked around for somewhere to eat. As it was Low Season at the time of our Visit we found that many Restaurants and Eateries were closed, However this is when we came across about 3 Eateries close together, and deciding that the Piatsa Gourounaki looked the Best of them all,we paid them a Visit.We looked around once inside and noticed another level,which was up a flight of Stairs and chose a Table close by which overlooked the Serving Area.We were given some Menu,s which had quite a choice albeit more geared towards that of Kebabs and Souvlaki,s ,with choices of Chicken,Pork,Lamb,and Veal, with a Good Selection of Sauces and Sides,with both Hot and Cold Starters. After making our Choices I tried to make the Waitress aware of my Order,who although had difficulty trying to understand me despite my Broken Greek,was very Friendly and directed me towards the Counter where we had entered the Premises. I ordered no more than a Portion of Fried Potato,s with some Warm Pitta Bread for my other half , whilst I ordered the Chicken Platter for myself,which came with 2 Chicken Souvlaki Skewers, Chicken Thighs, and Chicken Kebab with Salad and also Fried Potato,s, along with an Order of 2 Diet Cokes.This came to just under 15 Euro,s and along with my Receipt I was given a Buzzer Contraption that lit up when your Order was ready to collect from the Counter. Non the Less the Food was Delicious and Fresh,whilst also of a Good Quality, and whilst being also Popular amongst its Regulars was exceptionally Clean.I did notice that some were given what looked like a Complimentary Dessert although we did not,but then again we did feel quite Stuffed and would not have been able to make the room in our Stomachs for One. Overall if you fancy a Good Lunch or even just a Snack, this is one place that I can Definitely Recommend.!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Massive portions of delicious, greek food accompanied by an extremely friendly and clean environment! Excellent and fast service! The quality of food will never disappoint you! Reasonable prices and free dessert at the end.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,It was very good. Now it' not. The quality of meat is not the best. What makes the food delicious are sauces. If you try to eat the meat without the sauces you will find that this is nothing special,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This place gives you an authentic greek experience. The hospitality is genuine and the food is amazing! I highly recommend the Graviera hot starter which is basically a cheese pastry which tastes like a piece of Heaven. Chicken Souvlaki is great as well. The best part is that you might get a free desert at the end of your meal :)Every time I visit Cyprus I come back to this place, so I definitely recommend it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you visit Nicosia, you must visit this restaurant. Big portions at a great price. That's all I have to say",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"At the time of this review, in Nicosia there are 2 restaurants. Both with excelent food. The one by eleftherias square is more like a fast food where you order and pay and you wait for you order with a buzzer on your table. The one in the old town needs reservations. I highly recoment the chicken platter.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Value for money. Piatsa gourounaki is a nice place to visit in the old city. Very kind staff, fast service, good food, there are available platters for 2 people, good portions of food and most importantly gluten free options. Highly recomended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I entered without having read any particular guide before. And this was a beautiful surprise. The service is very friendly and quick. The food is very tasty and portions are quite large. Their Cyprian salad is absolutely delicious! And this was very affordable. You will not be disappointed. Really good!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very nice and warmy place!! Helpful stuff and great food...Tasty chicken thights with mustard sauce!! The wine in can its so point!! The service amazing...Chef turn around the tables and ask if its good the food..Modern greek songs make u feel happy and fantastic..Great job people!! Keep your team up!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Really enjoyed the food in this restaurant we had a selection of starters and souvlaki Staff were happy and attentive Would love to return,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I went knowing it was the top 1 in TripAdvisor so my expectations were high, and it was even better! Huuuuge portions, delicious food and very affordable prices. Starter of eggplant dip+chicken and salad+1/2 l of water 12,8‚Ç¨!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very busy, self service. Good food reasonable price. Good location. Friendly staff. That's it really",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"You really shouldn't expect much from places like this. Everything is mass produced and people seem to like it this way. The service was good, though.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Lovely food, good prices, massive portions , very clean inside , we had meat platter and chicken platter probably should of stuck to 1 platter for 2 of us, will be going back for sure",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food is delicious, the service is fast and the atmosphere is great located in the old city. It is recommended to get there early as I don't believe you can reserve and people arriving after us could get a table. Highly recommended and we visit every time we are in the area.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is the best casual grill place in Cyprus, but is expensive for its genre but I'd still go there again. The service is good, the food is good as well and I overate",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,One of the best platter that i ate so far. This place besides that is very very beautiful inside and outside offers some of the tasty greek cuisine you will ever find in the capital. I recommend you to go there if you are in town but don‚Äôt eat before you go. The portions are big size,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"When in Nicosia, go to Piatsa for one of the best meals, service and value of anywhere in the world. Being from Nashville and loving Cyprus, Piatsa is a destination. We love this place. The owner and chef makes you feel like family. He always socializes with us and lets us know how much he appreciates our dining there. Not only that , he prepared a special Cyprus dish and presented it thefor our enjoyment. This place is special so make sure you try this awesome place. The food is impeccable and the service is excellent. A true rewarding experience.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Awesome meat + good price + nice place. Highly recommend. Plate for two was delicious. Full stomach and smile on the face after food like this :),Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Food is good, service is good. Polite and welcoming waiters. Menu always stays the same. And you can't sit 4 adults for dinner in a coffee table, get real.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Really good food, big portions, tasty meniu. Dessert is on the house, good atmosphere, inside and outside tables. Highly recommend it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,A very delicious and value for money experience. Decent for the family quick restaurant. Must visit.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Everything-from the food, complementary snacks to a service - was awesome. Totally would recommend this place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Another great dinner of a meat platter for 2 with an extra salad and drink and all under 30 for 2. The service as always excellent and food fantastic. Well recommended. !!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"Ok food, nothing you cant make at home tough. Grilled Meat with fries, nothing out of the ordinary to say it nicely. Maybe i was unlucky - my visit did not meet my expectations at all. High rating, cheap price - food 3/10",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,If you are looking for reliable Cypriot food this is your place. What it lacks in imagination it makes up for consistency. Go for meze and stick to the souvlaki. House wines are affordable and solid table wine quality. Spice it up with Ouzo over dinner and prepare to attack large portions.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent grilled souvlaki , pork plates, Greek salads Greek meme at its best. Quick and efficient service, open until late night. Downtown NICOSIA city closed to shopping , ready for lunch or dinner.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"A revisit to this eatery brand which is situated in the under-developed backstreets of the capital city. Complimentary savoury crispbread with olive oil were served as a nice kick off to this lunchtime meal. A Greek salad was ordered which was quite plentiful and extremely good - served with Greek bread.I ordered the lamb and veal kebab served on Greek pitta bread with chips and a tomato and thick yoghurt sauce. You probably could have done without the sauce. The kebabs were extremely good and hard to finish off (as plentiful) - bearing in mind that there was still some of the salad to complete. I also sampled the lamb souvlaki which was very good. By this time, one was very full, although a complimentary mehalebi/cornflower type dessert was served along with a mastiha (gum) liquor as a digestive.This is indeed a place I would not hesitate in recommending, for the simple reason, that this eatery serves quality food at exceptional value. This lunch for (two) cost around ‚Ç¨27 which actually takes some beating. The service was very friendly, prompt and overall an excellent experience!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent service, nice food, also very reasonable price. I really introduce it to every body. The quantity of the food is also satisfactory.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,A very good restaurant with basic Greek souvlaki and other meat options on a great location. The staff is very friendly and keen to serve you.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I had just arrived at the old part of Ncosia (staying there for just one day), and was looking for a cozy place to have a quick lunch before my afternoon meeting. Based on the reviews I found, I went for Piatsa Gourounaki, which was just a 5 min. walk from my hotel - and it was really worth it!The place itself is really stylish, especially for a souvlaki-based place. Nice wooden tables, comfortable chairs, with selected restaurant items (like furniture) from the past. On top of that, you can virtually learn the history of souvlaki by reading the stories on the walls.The staff was extremely kind and helpful, which was really appreciated. They even warned me that I was ordering too much and suggested that I would go slow with my order - which was right and for once more appreciated.I ordered two wrapped souvlaki, a pork one and the bacon one. In the meantime, I was offered a nice warm and at the same time refreshing starter / salad with pligouri and tzatziki, which was really tasty. Both souvlaki were big, stuffed and tasty - enough for a foodie adult like me. Before I finished, I was again offered a saganaki (fried graviera cheese with crust, honey and vinegar) which I would regret I would have missed from the menu - a dish you should definitely try.My lunch concluded with a shot and a refreshing pana cotta on the house, which was the best way to end this experience. Overall, I was one of the best tasting experiences I had lately (yes, with this humble but tasty food!) and the service was excellent. To make things even better, having spent a bit more than EUR10, all this was a great value for money.It was a lazy afternoon when I visited Piatsa Gourounaki, but still the waiter was always around the tables, asking if everything is ok, if we needed anything else etc. Even the manager dropped by my table to talk to me about a new dish they were working on; the tasty saganaki I mentioned earlier!Big thanks to the owner and staff of the place for their efforts and for treating customers in such a warm way, regardless the amount off their bill; they show that they respect customers and do the extra mile for each one of them.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I was there for lunch, they welcomed me so nicely. I took the kabab, the portion size was good and was more than enough. I got malabi and liqueur on the house. A very good value for money.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Really nice food and good prices!! the stuff working there is amazing! all the waiters are really polite, friendly and make you feel so welcome! definitely recommend!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Great restaurant for visiting with family or friends. Casual and relaxed atmosphere and very friendly staff. This is a kebab place with lot‚Äôs of yummy food, platters to share, salads, dips etc. Some vegetarian options are available. We like to visit for some casual dining any time of the week. It gets too busy during the weekend and does not take reservations so be prepared to queue for a while. The food is tasty, the prices are reasonable and the service is quick and efficient. Sure we will visit again soon.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I actually love this place, the workers are way to nice and the owner is the nicest person I've ever met. The meat itself is very good but the sauces they bring with it brings it to the next level. Definitely going back.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Lively restaurant. Nice courteous staff. Good change of food after having Cypriot souvlaki for 2 months. Don't order starters if you plan to order a whole portion of any meal. Just too much food.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"After a morning sight seeing, stopped here for lunch off the main drag (Ledra). Shared a meat platter for two, with salad and a refreshing beer. Excellent food, fantastic service and nice quiet location tucked away from the main shopping strip.Was treated to a local dessert and liqueur to finish off the meal, brilliant!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very nice restaurant, after the food they offered us a desert and a shot of Mastiha (traditional drink)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Love this place, with very good prices, amazing greek food, and perfect service. I love the fact that people who work there, love their work, they are always happy, cheerful and ready to serve you",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent service, beautiful establishment, delicious starters (cold and hot), good prices. Enjoy it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"While in Nicosia, do yourself a tremendous favor and dine in possibly one of the best restrants in the world. The value, service and gratitude is unsurpassed. We have been to Piatsa numerous times in the past and was overwhelmed in our past visits but our most recent visit underlies why the dining mecca holds it's high regard in this city. After a sixteen month last visit, not only did the owner remember us and greet us but cooked us a special dish to galvanize our adoration for this amazing restraunt. Don't walk......Run to this wonderful place and enjoy. You will not be disappointed!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I have been there a lot of times. It is a great option if you want to visit the area of the old city and you want to have good value for money food. Meat platters can be shared from 3 to 4 people. Service is always good and the personnel very kind. You might need to wait for some time to be seated but I guess it depends from the day and time of your visit.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is a basic, traditional Greek Restaurant serving tasty, good value food. Don‚Äôt be temped to order too much, the servings are very large and of excellent quality.I had the chicken platter, which comes on a lovely wooden tray with salad, dips and chips, I couldn‚Äôt eat it all.This is a little like a fast food style restaurant but don‚Äôt let this put you off, as the food is great.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Don‚Äôt be misled by the menus: the platters for two people is actually too much for four people! And the quality of the food is excellent. Plus you get a sweet and mastic snaps at the end. All for just under ‚Ç¨10 ahead including beers. Don‚Äôt miss it, there are now two locations.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"There are 2 restaurants in Nicosia old village. It seems to be good and well known for locals. We were amazed how just after the opening for dinner it was full in 20min.Staff is professional, polite.Food is Super BIG portion! So, if you are not really hungry, just order few starters.Food is delicious, fresh and tasty.Try olive paste with pita, grilled chicken and soft goat cheese with honey.Definitely come back and reckoned.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"The Restaurant is Greek as opposed to Greek Cypriot my host informed me. Either way it is excellent. We sat at a high table inside. We had hot cheese pies to start with, lovely flaky pastry, dotted with sesame seeds and a lemon and honey syrup, oozing, unctious cheese on the insideFour of us shared a meat platter, which was more than enough.Excellent pork souvlaki, chicken and finely minced lamb kebab. Fries dusted with oregano, more pork wrapped in bacon and grilled vegetables. Oh yes bread and dips tooWe were given milk puddings and a mastic digestif on the houseEven with beers the meal was very reasonably priced. The service was excellent",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food, big portions, very very friendly staff, prices are more than acceptable.. Big big recommondation!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Slightly out of the main way but amazing, high quality food and wonderful, friendly service. You can eat inside or out, but being very hot, we chose to sit inside. We came here for lunch and the Menu was extensive. We had the Meat Platter for 2 which comes with thin fries, which was enormous, very filling, flavoursome and absolutely delicious. Our daughter had the Chicken Pitta Souvlakia which was full of soft chicken and also accompanied by skinny fries. Drinks were 1 Coke, a large Keo and Still Water and the bill came to an amazing 28.80 Euros. After asking for the Bill, our lovely waitress told us to wait as she would bring dessert. Everyone who eats gets a delicious, traditional milk pudding with fresh fruits and a small glass of a traditional ""digestif"" which was also very pleasant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Well, this place gets a solid 5 dots. If it were my way (from many previous posts), it would be 10 out of 10.The food was excellent. However, watch out, they tend to give you too much. The service from the first warm greeting to the last goodnight, was nothing but perfect. The price was affordable for even a pensioner.No doubt about it. I don‚Äôt hand out this score too often but Piatsa really deserves it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The portions are generous, tasty and the service is great, the location is in old town which makes it more enjoyable",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"No matter how many times you go, irrespective of time or season you always get a very nice souvlaki experience at the right price. Both the main one and the express restaurant offer the same quality, but not the same menu.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,A great place with even better food. The locaci√≥n is magnificent and the staff is extremely friendly,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We ordered the meat platter for 2 which is surely for more than 2 people and it was value for money. The service was quick and the atmosphere nice.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Definitely worth visiting, especially if you are a meat lover... Good prices with big portions. Can be popular, so book or go out of main hours",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"A family friendly atmosphere, with casual dining, great food and good prices, get there early to avoid standing in queue waiting for a table, the staff are fun and helpful.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very hospitable and forthcoming. They adjusted the menu for us and the result was very succesful! Had the vegetarian platter with complementary salad and dessert.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you are a meat lover, this is the place to be. Everything is BBQ and test good. And it's in great location. After lunch / dinner you can walk Nicosia's shopping street.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,The place is located in a nice spot in the old city of Lefkosia (Nicosia). They do not make reservations and so you have to visit the place either a bit early during the day or after the rush hour. You can wait there of course if you want to gamble for an early departing table. The stuff is generally polite and friendly. The managers behave as they should and they usually treat you with a drink when the meal is over.Their portions are generous and the quality is good. There is a big variety to chose from and most of it is good.There is actually nothing bad to say of the place and the title says it all.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is great place with amazing food.All ingredients are fresh and meals are cooked to order. Really tasty traditional Cypriot food. There is something for everyone, no matter if you are a true meat lover or strict vegetarian of vegan.The staff are very nice and are always looking after the guests.Keep in mind that this place is a bit too popular and not always you can find space but it is totally worth the wait.Whenever you go to Nicosia, it is a must to pay this place a visit.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Went twice whilst in Nicosia and would have been more had we discovered it earlier. Fresh food cooked to order. Ordered the meat platter for two, pork best ever. Second time had lamb chops which were the most delicious, cooked to perfection. Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, excellent food - what‚Äôs not to love?",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"While out on a tour of Nicosia we were looking for somewhere to have a bite to eat. After looking for a recommended eatery, we chose this lovely restaurant.While it is lovely inside, we chose to sit outside in the good sized eating area.After ordering our drinks we perused the very inviting menu. I had the large chicken souvlaka while other members of my family had chicken souvlaka in pitta bread or other versions of souvlaka.All the food was well cooked and presented and was extremely tasty and filling. The portion sizes are very good without being too much.Coming from London, I found the prices to be very reasonable.All in all, all 5 of us were very pleased, and we range in age from 30-80's.I would have no problem in heartily recommending this restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I can only recommend this place. Everything we had was delicious. We tried some of the chiefs recommendations and it was a great choice.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Really good place that is alwas busy. Food is freshly cooked to order and very tasty with a good selections of dishes for everyone. You order at the counter and are given a buzzer to take bacj]k to your table and it lts you know when you food is ready so you can go and collect it. It's a resaurant but you are your own waiter however there are staff on hand who will give you advice about the menu and what to choose. Great idea that works really well. A must visit place if you are in Nicosia. We will return.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,As a personal opinion this place has the best pork souvlaki I have ever tried and everything else is average. However they are ahead of the competition and will always be because of the genius that told them to focus on their top quality service and great decoration of the place. Even with average quality food it‚Äôs always packed and you need to wait to eat but I highly recommend everyone that will pass by Nicosia to try them out.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I ordered the charred chicken wings while my wife went for some traditional starter dishes. Everything was delicious.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Large portions, a very busy well liked restaurant, sitting outside in the sun, watching the world go by. Good selection of grilled meats,",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We chose the meat platter as it‚Äôs the most popular choice & weren‚Äôt disappointed! Food was tasty and I can recommend the restaurant. We got here just as the lunchtime rush commenced so the service was a bit slower than expected but the staff recognised it and gave us a complementary dessert & a shot of alcohol.If you‚Äôre looking for an authentic meal, include this in your itinerary.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,4 adults and one child dined together last evening. Our selections encompassed true carnivores and some vegetarians and all walked away very satisfied indeed. There was some theatre from the waiters but this was in the spirit of great service. The food itself is prepared with love and is very plentiful too. We came as a result of a recommendation and would wholeheartedly also recommend it to couples and groups. I saw large groups being seated so I am not sure why this is negatively reflected in other reviews. Well done to you all. Great job.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Regularly eat here since they opened and never been disappointed. Food fresh & tasty and service always good!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Went yesterday with two friends. Since they open at 7 pm and we arrived earlier, we decided to drink a beer to a place near this restaurant. I must say that I was amazed on how fast the place got populated in the first minutes after they opened.The food was great. We were treated very well. The Meat Platter was delicious, however, we didn't manage to eat everything they served, so the price is fair (in my opinion).They also give you some free desert... It's not too much, yet something to be appreciated.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very good stuff, the service was excellent and the food portion was big . I highly recommend to try the chicken platter for two and definitely will visit it again with my friends",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Located in the old town. The service is perfect and the waiters very helpful and polite. The dish of meat for two is enough for 3 definitely and was tasty. The salad with tomatoes fresh and well seasoned. The prices are reasonable ... I recommend this place , nice atmosphere too. Tip: the place is almost always pack ...!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Great Greek cuisine. Nice place. Good food. It takes no reservation which is good. Service is nice. The chef circles around.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,My partner and I had lunch here in September 2019 and it was AMAZING. The service was great too. We would both thoroughly recommend if you‚Äôre in nicosia!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very nice and helpful staff, nice environment , energizing music,The food was good and the portions are big",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visited this gem based on Tripadvisor reviews and everything was excellent.The food- delicious, do try the potatoes with feta and bacon.The service- best in Cyprus for sure, attention to the detail, lots of recommendations (even told us not to order big portions), very fast.The menu- extensive=lot of options from Cypriot & Greek cousine, reasonably priced.Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Best meal so far in Cyprus, lovely choice, quick service, good staff- we trained and knew the menu ..fantastic price what more can I say apart from it's a must when in town",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Visited here two nights of our holiday, my husband used to come here 3 years ago and said we had to try it again. Couldn‚Äôt fault the service, food and atmosphere. Complimentary pudding, Mastic and couscous dishes all made the meal and for such a reasonable price. Definitely worth it‚Äôs top rating here.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Six of us chose here on a Saturday lunchtime because of it‚Äôs top TA ranking & all of us were delighted.Some drinks, two meat platters, salad & a couple of other mezes for under ‚Ç¨80. Too much for us but great quality food & good service - what‚Äôs not to love!Friendly staff, who were helpful with our menu selection & offered help with our sightseeing.Complimentary Mastixa liquor was a nice touch.Would have no hesitation recommending & returning.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Visited on a Sunday for late lunch... opens at 5:00 pm. Nice atmosphere, quick and friendly staff, value for money tasty food! I think we were lucky because it wasn‚Äôt busy when we visited but it‚Äôs a better, more Greek ... fast food!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The meat platter easily serves 1.5 to 2 people. Cooked fresh. The meat is juicy and the pita on the bottom soaks up all the juice. Not surprised it has top spot, well deserved. Place is immaculate to boot.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This place has a very relaxed atmosphere and is self service. The food is good, while leaning towards the ""fast food"" catagory. It's a bit spicy. It's definitely cheap to eat there since, with about Euros10, a person can get a large platter of food with a drink.According to my experience the food quality and quantity is reliable.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food is very delicious and typically traditional. We were sitting outside, because is summer and we liked to enjoy the summer nights on this special restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,This place is always very crowded. Choice is very good. I love that they serve their meat platters with grilled vegetables. They don't accept reservations and they are open only until 23:00,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visited this restaurant for the first time. They serve excellent Greek dishes with high quality materials, mainly meat and salads. The service was good. Most importantly all is value for money.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We stumbled upon piatsa in the first of our 8 weeks stay in Nicosia- by the end it was a weekly tradition. Our first night the chef personally came to our table, bringing new items for us to try. The manouri cheese is one of our favorites!! It is each of our favorite places- vegans and meat lovers alike. There is no doubt piatsa and chef heracleous are what we will miss most about Cyprus.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The ‚ÄúPig in Bow Tie‚Äù was fantastic from the moment we were meet at the front door until we left. The food was outstanding catering for all our needs. The service throughout was 1st class and they couldn‚Äôt do enough for you.The value for money is second to none and prices are cheap, really cheap.I rate this venue at 5*",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I'd just arrived in Lefkosia on my first ever visit to Cyprus, and in my search for a pleasant setting for dinner, where I could sit outside in the warm barmy air, I chanced upon Piatsa Gourounaki as I was exploring the area around Faneromeni Square and Faneromenis and Onasagorou Streets. The restaurant was very busy, with lots of tables spilling out onto the street and into a small laneway to the side; it also had an extremely pleasant, stylish and contemporary dining area inside. I was shown to an outside table, and enjoyed a lovely light dinner.The menu isn't huge, but it has a lovely selection on Cypriot and Greek specialities, with many offered in varying sizes. I chose chunky potato fries covered with a generous serving of a grated local cheese, and a lamb souvlaki served wrapped in a pita bread. Both were ample, served piping hot, and thoroughly delicious. Along with water, the bill came to little more than ‚Ç¨8.00; excellent value in my opinion.What I also really liked about this restaurant was the excellent service. I was presented with a menu in English; the waiting staff were pleasant and obliging. More significantly, I was well looked after as a solo diner, and I was able to enjoy my meal at a leisurely pace, without feeling hurried. The restaurant became extremely busy as I was dining, and a very long queue had gathered in the street waiting for a table. I wasn't hurried in any way; I really appreciated that. It's clearly a popular spot for locals and tourists, and I was blessed with a really enjoyable dining experience.It's on my list, if ever I return to Lefkosia, and I recommend it highly!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I visit Piatsa Gourounaki many times a year. It has amazing fresh food on both of its restaurants. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone that wants to try Greek food.No one can compete with its chicken variety option.And of course prices are perfect and the portions are great.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visit very often this restaurant, and every time the food is excellent!!! The vegetarian option is perfect!!! I appreciate that! The staff every time is excellent, smiley and funny with our children! Bravo guys!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very tasty food and affordable prices. We loved their souvlakia and variety of dips. Convenient for families with children.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"In the centre of Old Nicosia, close to Faneromenis church, this restaurant serves excellent Cypriot cuisine with friendly (& child-friendly) service. In summer, there is seating in and outside. There is no advance booking, so come and queue about 20 minutes before you expect to eat. Waiting, you might feel like the ravenous big bad wolf, calling 'little pig, little pig, let me come in!', but the wait will be well worth it. Apart from the food, the wine is excellent.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Nice place, reasonable pricing in comparison with other places in Nicosia. Friendly staff. No reservations which is a good thing. Food good but a bit oily that make it heavy...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Best souvlaki I ever tried. Friendly and professional service, excellent food. Definitely worth to visit. Highly recommended",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"First time we visited Piatsa Gourounaki, when we were walking by and it seemed very interesting. The place is great and always busy! We were surprised how the order came 1 min after the waiter took our order. I even asked if it was by accident, to which the waiter replied ‚ÄúI can take it back and bring to you in 20 mins if you wish, sir‚Äù :DUsually people even wait here in queue until a table is free to be seated.We alway last enjoy the meat or chicken choice for two and salad ‚Äútakos‚Äù",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Delicious food fresh and tasty at a very reasonable price. Personel is very friendley and accomodating. They offered us complimentary desert and drink. Available open Wifi. Definitely will be there tomorrow again. Just be preoared to wait fora seat but it is worth it üòâ,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Really delicious with big portion and affordable price. Had a mix grill menu with 5 souvlakis and a generous portion of salad, fries and bread, even got a pudding in the end. Nice place and conveniently located near the bus station and ledra street. Will return here someday",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I enjoyed a meal at Piatsa yesterday. The hotel recommended it, saying that it was authentic Cypriot food, with great service.The Chef greeted me personally and recommended a mixed grill of souvlaki with Greek salad and a terrific starter. The food was excellent, the tomatoes in the salad were wonderful.The crowd was a mix of locals and tourists. The house barrel wine was pretty decent.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Simply amazing. Fresh and crispy salads, tasty meat. That would be enough on its own, but when you see their prices you won't want to leave this place. For 20-25 euro you could have a great dinner for two, or even less if you don't drink.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Went to this restaurant a couple years again and returned to Nicosia especially so we could re-visit this restaurant! We were seated at 7:30; it was nice and busy, but not as busy as when we left at 8:45, by which time there was a queue. The hostess very kindly allowed us to to-and-fro trying to choose where we wanted to sit, and it was very nice sitting out on the terrace, where we ended up. They brought out crispy things with a little pot of olive oil for us while we were waiting for our food, and the meals themselves were absolutely delicious. My parents ordered the meat platter for two which came at around ‚Ç¨17 - incredible value considering the huge quantity and variety of meats, the grill vegetables, pitta bread, and huge pile of chips that it comes with. I myself ordered the grilled vegetables (nice and well-done, HUGE portion, good variety) with their speciality cous-cous (I have no words to describe this cous-cous, try it for yourself and you‚Äôll see what I mean...). As if we weren‚Äôt full enough already, we were then served a panna cotta desert each (at least it looked like panna cotta?) with a shot of alcohol each, both of which were on the house. The service at this restaurant is absolutely fantastic too, we didn‚Äôt catch his name but the waiter with the eyebrow ring was absolutely lovely, smiling and joking with us. Including two bottles of Keo and a large bottle of water the bill didn‚Äôt even come to ‚Ç¨34, which is incredible considering that we were essentially served a three course meal of incredible quality and quantities. I will NOT be visiting ANY OTHER restaurant in Nicosia when I next visit!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Found this place on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. We both ate well and the bill was less than ‚Ç¨20. Would recommend.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Read great reviews of this place and it did not disappoint! The souvlaki was delicious and meat was very good quality and tasty. All the food here looked really good quality and delicious. I went to the Express branch next to Eleftheria Square where you can sit outside and it is self service. The place was very busy and had a very good vibe.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is the sort of restaurant you can have a quick lunch or dinner very fast, but the quality is better than fast food! It‚Äôs the only place I‚Äôve been to in Cyprus which resembles a ‚ÄúGreek souvlaki place‚Äù. The Halloumi in pitta is great, the vegetarian platter also. Not the best pork souvlaki I had I much admit though. At the end of the meal they treat you to some dessert which is a lovely gesture. Prices are good also.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I went with my family because of all the recommendations and we were so amazed! Both the meat and vegetarian souvlaki was delicious (one platter is enough for two people). The staff were so professional and kind, and even though we told the waiter we were too full, he kindly offered a complimentary dessert. I cant recommend this place enough!Also, good value for money",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Excelent service by Christodoulos and Giorgos...best night out ever...will visit again soon...thank you x,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great souvlakia with special salad in the side i love the hunny mustard dip all fresh excellent places !!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,If it wasn't for the long wait(if you are not there early) I could probably say the best value for money place in Nicosia!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Nice extensive menu with many 1 euro starters. I opted out on a side of mushrooms, which were cooked to perfection with a great topping, french fries and a lamb kebob.Srevice was great, when i asked for the check, the waiter told me he would bring after he brings me a dessert and a liquor on the house.This place is extremely busy but i no way was anyone rushed. To the contrary, yhey want you to take your time and enjoy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We stopped for lunch, we had the vegetarian platter for 2, the food was very good. Excellent service, very friendly, we were offered a starter to welcome us and a desert and house spirit to say goodbye!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"On a hot day in Cyprus nobody can wish for a better spot to rest and eat healthy food than Piatsa Gourounaki. Excellent food is paired with excellent and very friendly service. The meats and salads are fresh and tasty and the small dessert on the house is, unlike many super-sweet desserts, quite refreshing and delicious. The waiters are attentive and fast, you really feel like eating at a friend's house.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Amazing trip to Cyprus I cannot say enough good things about the staff, the food, the cleanliness and the quality/quantity magnificent!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This place definitely more suitable for meat eaters, but vegetarians and vegans could find a variety of side dishes to do the trick. It is in the middle of the Ledra which is the main street in the touristic area of the old city.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This has been one of many returning times we have visited Piatsa Gourounaki. Excellent prompt service and food quality. No wonder it is still ranked #1 in Trip Advisor in Nicosia. Highly satisfied, will revisit it for sure!",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"We visited with my husband because of the good reviews and we weren't disappointed. Very nice atmosphere, very helpful and polite staff, great food, reasonable prices. Will visit again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We have choosen restaurant after visit occupied terratory. It is near to control gates. We have got table inside as outside was full but asked waitress.if there would be free outside we would sat over. In 5 min, we could go outside. They did not forget. We have choosen many starters for only 1 EUR per piece and meats, salads and spreads. I wanted to choose halumi, but waitress told us I could choose it all over Cyprus, I should choose their special, pasta covered cheese. It was delicious with sesame and honey. All other food were great and tasty. Flavours were in harmony and some of them was really different from other places's kitchens. Restaurant has become full within 30 minutes but the staff handles everything very professionally. Just to show their profesionalism, Some drops of rain startes to fall and staff after 1st drop, opened huge umbrellas, although I think rain is not common here, another example, I went to restroom before and there was out of soap at machine. After 30 minutes, i went back again, and it was refilled, eventhough staff handled 200 people's dinner.wow, congrats!I reccomend u to go there as prices are low, but quality is superb",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Nice Casual Place with Good Greek Food. The prices are very good with quality overwelming your plate. The portion could be larger.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Good food. Reasonable prices.Nice and friendly service. Good locations. With free dessert at the end of your meal.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We had dinner here on a Saturday night. Very busy (lots of families) but with a friendly atmosphere. The service is good but very quick, a bit too quick, almost fast food like. There were people queuing on the street waiting to be seated which made us feel like we had to rush to clear the table for the next one.But the (vegetarian) dish was very good!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food, sizeable portions, a friendly wait staff, reasonable prices, and a stellar location. Definitely deserves its reputation as one of the top places in Nicosia to eat!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very nice clean restaurant, food was excellent, only go though if you are a meat lover!!!Great variety of meat dishes and very tasty side dishes. Would recomment with no doubt. It would have been easier if you can book a table but unfortunately there are no bookings so its sometimes impossible to find a table. Shows how great the food is. The staff are nice too very helpful.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I just love the place and you will too.The food there is just amzing and delicious. I reccoment the place, low prices and delicious food its just amazing",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We stayed at a Airbnb near the old city centre of Nicosia and were looking for a nice place to eat. Piatsa Gourounaki was highly recommended by TripAdvisor, so we decided to go there for dinner.- Location -Piatsa Gourounaki is located near one of the most popular shopping/eating streets in Nicosia, named Ledra Street. I would suggest going in to the city centre on foot, although you can find some small parking areas. There is also a buss station near from where it is a 10 minutes walk to Piatsa Gourounaki.- Restaurant -The restaurant looks very inviting and nice. I think this is a restaurant where a lot of the locals are going to as well. They have plenty of places to sit outside and inside, so there will be a favourite place for everyone.- Food -The food was really good, we tried the meat platter for 2, some greek salads and pita‚Äôs. We enjoyed the food and everyone was feeling satisfied after the food was finished.- Drinks -They have beer, soda‚Äôs and wine, so something for everyone.- Service -The staff was very kind and professional. They even came to make some jokes and they answered all our questions very detailed.- Price -The price is extremely cheap for what you get. We really enjoyed the food, service and drinks. We only had to pay ‚Ç¨55,- euro for a party of 4, which is really cheap. It gives room for a large tip though, which they definitely deserved.- Conclusion -I would really recommend going here so you can have a great evening. The food is great, the staff very friendly and the overall experience really good.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"We stopped for lunch on a busy day sightseeing in Nicosia. The food was absolutely gorgeous and came quickly and the service was friendly and welcoming! We shared a halloumi starter and then each had lamb kebabs in pitta. The meat was tender and full of flavour, the pitta was light and fluffy and the sauce was spicy. With two drinks as well the bill was less than 17 euros! Totally recommend!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,With the busy tourist street of Ledras metres away I would normally avoid places like this. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt what a fantastic place for lunch. The meat platter was awesome with some of the best tasting souvlaki pork I‚Äôve ever eaten. Don‚Äôt miss this place if you cross the Nicosia border,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"We have stumbled upon this restaurant one evening when visiting Nicosia with my husband and daughter and another family of 3. The atmosphere is very cosy and welcoming, the owner is there, a strong presence making people feel welcome. Informal and friendly but with good quality food. You get some nice little bites on arrival and our meat platter was generous and delicious, but we struggled to finish it all, so make sure you are hungry. The kids were also happy with plenty of choice. Great evening, thank you.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Two years on from our first visit we found ourselves in Nicosia again and had to go back - and it's still amazing! Every single aspect wins top marks, from the polite and helpful staff (especially the guy serving outside - he's a star) to the food (tasty, clean, well presented, incredibly priced) to the bathrooms (exceptionally clean)... I don't understand why this restaurant hasn't taken over the world yet... can you please open one in Lebanon?",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Had lunch here yesterday. The food was great! Everything was prepared to the tee, simply delicious! Service was excellent and prices very reasonable. Highly recommended and would gladly return.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Nice and fast service by the staff. Great taste of the food, enjoyable atmosphere. Nothing negative to comment. And all these at low cost, maximum ‚Ç¨10 per person for enough quantity of food",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We had a lunch here and met up with a few friends. We loved the food. Definitely worth the price. We tried the veggie and grilled meat mixed plates. Both are excellent.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,One of the best local restaurant I've ever been... well done to all!! Especially to your staff.. Fantastic,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is not a traditional greek/cyprian restaurant, I would rather call it a local fast-food franchise, which has its origins from the greek/cyprian gastronomy. The place looks great and clean, the service was extra nice and helpful although there was a lot of customer in the same time. Food is very tasty and comes in an enormous size. (We could only eat the half of what we ordered. )Also we got a surprise panna cotta for free as a gift. :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"It‚Äôs like the Mc Donald‚Äôs of Greek food. Everything is prepared and cooked and served so quickly that you feel that you have to eat fast and leave. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the food is still great!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We arrived at 19:30 and thre were a lot of free tables. 30 minutes later some people were waiting for tables a few minutes. They are fast and they are good. We ordered 14 different things and some of them were there in 5 minutes some in 10, but no more. Maybe this is the only one problem here. A little bit too fast. You can have the feeling that you have to be so fast as well. But you dont! All the tastes are like in a real family run taverna somwhere in the countryside, but reasonable portions. You can chose in most cases from 3 different size. Normally the small is enough for two, and so you can taste a lot of things. It's hard to say, but it was perfect.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Cozy atmosphere,very friendly staff and tasty food ! Great value for money!! Higjly recommended!!!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Food and service always at the level. With nice treats afterward like panacota garnished with cherry and masticha liquor,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Very good and fresh food A lot of quantity even too much maybe For a really reasonable price. Service is slimy, efficient. It is a self service so it could worried you. This restaurant is n1 there is a reason :) Don‚Äôt hesitate",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"My girlfriend and I stumbled upon the place, but it was worth it! The menu was very comprehensive, and we had one heck of a time deciding what to order. The waiters assured us that the souvlaki (i.e. skewered meat) was incredibly fresh, and that was what we ordered; however, I went for the pita. On top of that, we both ordered the Greek salad, which honestly could have fed two people per serving! For a place that catered to both locals and tourists alike, we felt that the price was reasonable and for sure worth it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Piatsa gourounaki is a value for money option. Two to three people can eat with approximately 20 euros total if you share the chicken platter or the pork platter. Excellent service (200%). They also offer you a dessert at the end. Totally recomend this place. Moreover, they are not making reservations so you can always wait to be seated for about 15 minutes max.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,Quick but excellent quality of food always fresh green salat nice atmosphere and smiling faces ready to help.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you‚Äôre in Nicosia, you MUST to eat here. We visited the restaurant as a family and were immediately greeted by a lovely gentleman who seated us quickly, turned the heater on and swiftly delivered croutons to our table. We proceeded to order wine (of course) and two of the platters, the meat and the vego. This was plenty of food for the 4 of us! The food was real, fresh, light and obviously made with love. To make the night better, the owner and chef came out to our table to see if everything was okay, and we ended up sitting down to have a yarn with him, listening to the story of how he came to own this restaurant. Dessert was then delivered to us on the house (what a bloody bonus!) and digestive liquor was shared between my family and the owner! This dining experience was great memory to take away from our time in Nicosia. Couldn‚Äôt recommend more!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Service was perfect, just perfect, and the food was gorgeous! Absolutely no 1 in Nicosia! We highly recommend!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Arrived in Nicosia to see my daughter, she took us here the first night. What a great place to eat on your first night in Cyprus. Very authentic Greek food. One thing I learned on my stay though‚Ä¶the bread, the filo dough appetizers, and the pastries are killer.We had the pita with tzantziki sauce, Graviera cheese in pastry, caramelized onions and a Greek salad with feta, to start, and then four orders of the lamb/veal kabab, and an order of French fries. Whoa.Topped off with a couple carafes of red wine‚Ä¶and we were in heaven.We were too stuffed for desert but I‚Äôm sure it would have been great, too.Don‚Äôt miss this place",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We visited on Thursday night so it was busy due to Valentines! The food was as good as last time and the staff both attentive and helpful!

50,"This is a good choice for eat, something between fast food and restaurant... Different and cozy decoration, friendly and smiling service, good prices, in the heart of Old Nicosia City Center.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Our best meal in Cyprus in 10 days. I can see why this restaurant is top of the list on Tripadvisor.A bustling place with a high turnover but we were never hurried. We tried a selection of small dishes and enjoyed each one. The complimentary desserts were a bonus. The service was excellent and our waiter was very patient in explaining some dishes to us.Would definitely recommend .,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We came here for lunch in February, 2019. The place was open for service and the waiters greeted us and offered to have a look at menu before being seated.We also asked for some explanation on the dishes and were eagerly provided that. The order was taken and didn't take too much time before food started appearing.Souvlaki in wrap was excellent, so was the salad and olives ordered to it. At the end we were offered a free dessert and liqueur shot.All in all we were super satisfied with the place and the service, and the prices are more than democratic.If we are ever back to Nicosia, this would be place number one we come to eat.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The portions are huge for the price. This place is highly recommended for everyone who wants to try traditional Cypriot food.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Always fully packed, the food and service are excellent despite that. Only negative or a proof of excellence is the long waiting lines to be seated",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is where my family usually has lunch when in Nicosia. Food and drinks are at reasonable price and yummy. With a 3 option platter including a vegetarian one ( at only 8.50‚Ç¨ ) I usually share and free mini dessert, this place is definitely worth a visit. I love their choice of Greek ""entechni""/pop music! It is self service but with friendly staff frequently checking on you. It is a spotless,three level building with two main entrances only a stone throw away from popular Ermou Street and the main bus station so very well situated.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We are four people but only order two platters. I think we need two more people to finish the food! Service is good. Highly recommended.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Maby the best ""low cost"" fast food place to eat in the Center of Nicosia. Frendly staff and good services.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Traditional Greek restaurant with delicious meze, excellent food presentation, extraordinarily friendly staff, upbeat atmosphere. Perfection!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I was drawn to this restaurant by previous reviews and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Not the easiest place to find; off Ledras not far from the border crossing. It was well worth the search. Meat is the specialty and the portion sizes extremely generous, although you can choose a smaller portion. My lamb souvlaki was awesome and truly satisfying for lunch. The platters for two people or more looked huge and seemed extremely popular.It is however the great staff and the added extras that really makes this place exceptional.

50,"My daughter found this place on tripadvisor, and we tried it for a late lunch after spending hours at the Cyprus Museum (and so were hungry).What a great pick!It wasn't easy to find (crowded walking mall area of the city), and parking was difficult to find in that part of the city.The restaurant was full and loud, and it appeared many customers were locals - all good signs.We got a table under a heatlamp, which was perfect for the ladies. The waiter arrived quickly, sized us up, and when asked for recommendations he laid out a plan for lunch that was perfect - really. When I asked for more of the warm and tasty pita bread he raised an eyebrow and asked 'are you sure?'. You know what? He was right. We couldn't finish it.The food arrived quickly, in large portions, and was very tasty. A family of five (with three famished young adults) ate our fill of excellent local dishes for less than 40 Euros. The complementary shot of zivania and dessert was a nice wrap up for a perfect meal.Great recommendations and service, Constantino!",Piatsa Gourounaki

Was pleasantly surprised and was soon clear why, great service & food. The local dessert on the house and the liqueur (forgot the name) was a nice touch. The owner came to ask how things were which showed personal attention being given to guests. Definitely should be tried if visiting Ledra Street.",Piatsa Gourounaki

We were served some appetizers as soon as we sat down.Food here is great, the chefs pay attention to the smallest details. The servers are amazing, very kind and helpful without being intrusive.

Loved every moment of it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visited Piatsa Gourounaki on the 1st Sunday in December which happened to be our wedding anniversary. We were greeted by the chef (Charis) who was as friendly as we found all the many waiting staff who looked after us to be. It's attractively decorated and the tables and chairs were comfortable.We were brought a complimentary starter (with delicious olive oil) and we ordered the vegetarian platter for 2 and a half litre of white barrel wine. The wine is excellent and I can say we thought all the items of the platter were very tasty. We're not strict vegetarians but didn't miss the lack of meat. We enjoyed our first bouyiordi ever (apparently a Macedonian dish from Thessaloniki) which contained peppers, onion, aubergine, tomatoes and feta - delightfully spicy. There was also bruschetta with tomato and feta, halloumi and tomatoes in pita, nice chips, delicious roasted peppers, aubergine, courgettes and tomatoes and 3 lovely dips - melitzanosalata, tahini and coriander dip - with Greek (flat) pita bread.We thought that was that but were brought a mahlepi cr√®me pudding each and a shot of mastic licqueur - yum! Great value for money - we paid less than ‚Ç¨30 including our tip. The restaurant was very busy but the staff seemed completely in control and we enjoyed our meal very much. Lots of items on the menu to suit most tastes. We'll be back for more next time we're in Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"This is one of the places in old Nicosia that most people rave about mainly as a value for money restaurant. I visited, even though I only eat chicken and it specialises in red meat, and was quite happy with what I had. Decent food, excellent service and very good prices. The only downside is that they don't reserve, plus it does have a ""fast-food"" place atmosphere about it. So you eat and feel you have to get up and leave. Fair enough, however, as both times I visited I had to go elsewhere.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Perfect Greek traditional foodI love this place because the food is delicious and the atmosphere is very friendly. What I like the most is the meat platters that I can share with my friends, specially the chicken platter. They serve platters with 2 sauces (tzantziki and mustard), fries and grilled vegetables. The vegetables are super nice!! The cost to eat is affordable. The only disadvantage is that you cannot make a reservation so you need to go early to find a table, otherwise you will wait in line!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,We were browsing the streets when we found this restaurant and decided to try it out.We went for a meat platter for 2 and some additional sauce.The Platter is huge and has different kind of grilled meat typical of Cyprus (souvlaki) served with grilled vegetables and french fries.The souvlakis where delicious and cooked perfectly.They have a house dessert (kind of a pannacotta with a local citrus taste and a cherry reduction).Prices are quite low.Excellent service from a young and motivated team!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We were invited by our friends there as guests. We arrived there just before 7 pm and people already queued up. The staff were very polite and able to explain the food in English.We got 2 platters for four people. Size and taste were completely perfect, especially the grilled veggies were as tasty as the meat on the platter. And of course, chips were freshly cut, not frozen!If you are planning to go there make sure that you are there just before 7 pm as they don't take reservations and the queue got longer after 7:30.",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"We read that the food and service were good so we thought we would give it a try. We first stopped by for lunch only to find that they only serve dinner this time of year....oh well we had lunch elsewhere but decided to return for dinner. We tend to eat early by Greek standards so we arrived at 7:15 and the place was already hopping. Got a nice table outside and were immediately served a small plate of toasted bread and olive oil. The owner came over and introduced himself and we had a conversation about the US as he lived there for a time. Very hospitable. We ordered a few mezas and the mixed meat plate. All as they should be. Portions are not huge but sufficient. The pork was a bit dry but the roasted vegetables were very good. We had 2 large beers, a small pitcher of wine and a club soda. We were comped a dessert and after dinner drink. My only problem is that the food arrived too quickly so we were done in about an hour. The total was ‚Ç¨34....real deal for what you get. Would recommend.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,They are run by a very talented group of people..could not find any flaws..food was ready on time..it was great tasting..tried their chicken platter..best in cyprus..and to top it all very reasonable prices,Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"We went with another family on a Friday night. Thanksfully we were able to find seats for the seven of us. The waiter promptly took our orders and the waiting began. We had to ask two times in order to get our drinks, which on a hot Cyprus night were much needed. Finally water came, but not our other drinks. Our food was served and it was quite good. Unfortunately we‚Äôd only received our water until this point and we needed to hunt down our water to receive our drinks. The beer must‚Äôve been poured and had sat for quite some time as it was very warm.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Absolutely amazing place to eat.Does get extremely busy and you may have to wait a while for a table but be patient as it‚Äôs worth it. We went twice in 1 week. The first time we ordered dips and pitta and meze bits to start then the chicken sharing platter. However we were so full up after the starter we hardly ate any of the platter which was a shame as it was gorgeous. We then decided to go back again and order just the platter and we really enjoyed it.Super friendly staff, very cheap prices and absolutely yummy fresh food.Definitely would visit again.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"The front of the shop gives no indication to what lies behind the building which is where you are taken for outside dining.you are surrounded by a nostalgic feeling of days gone by. There is also a ""private dining room"" which is equally nice if you prefer a more internal atmosphere.the food is excellent and service on the ball. Oh.....almosr forgot.....there is a pleasant surprise of kive music on one day if the week.Would definitely recommend",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"A colleague took me here as he found it wandering the old town streets and was so impressed. We had a meat platter for two with a few dips for entree.

We regularly visit the place for its delicious grilled chicken thighs and chicken souvlaki served with greek pita bread, fresh salad, tzatziki and hand made chips. The place offers a variety of traditional greek cheeses, grilled to perfection (graviera, manouri and many traditional greek dips). Dishes are well-presented and prices are value for money.

Waiter one to clean the table, Waiter two for the food order, Waiter three for the drinks and Waiter four for the starters.

50,"If you're looking for delicious Greek food for a good price, this is the place for you. They have a variety of dishes worth trying, but the yoghurt lamb kebab and beef pita are they're especially tasty. We tried the eggplant and tzatziki dip as appetizers and they didn't disappoint. If you want a salad that's a bit different, the Cretan salad is worth giving a try. Overall, a place offering delicious food, and good customer service.Keep in mind they don't make reservations and around lunch time it's ridiculously busy to the point where you have to wait in line outside for a table.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We were stuck in Nicosia in the heat of the middle of the day. Our bus wasn‚Äôt for another hour. We were looking for somewhere to eat and cool down whilst we waited for our bus.This was the haven we needed. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. You find a table, sit down, choose what you want, go to the counter, order and pay for your order. You get given a bleeper with your receipt and will get bleeped to pick up your order when it‚Äôs ready. We ordered a platter which was probably too much for two of us. I watched other people‚Äôs orders arrive and they looked just as good as ours. The quality was excellent, the choice on the menu had something for everyone and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely visit again. To top it up they brought us a traditional dessert on the house. Yum",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"My husband and I, visiting Cypr√∫s from South Africa on an extended 3 month holiday, visited Nicosia for a couple of days. We downloaded the ‚ÄúChoose Your Cyprus‚Äù app which we find very useful and it had featured Piatsa Gourounaki. While exploring La√Øki Yitonia we stumbled across the restaurant and so went back for supper. We absolutely loved it! Great relaxed vibe, attentive and quick service. Chose haloumi in pita, salad and the pork souvlaki and all were very good. Excellent barrel white wine complimented the meal. Finished off with the only dessert on offer, malahembi and Mastica liqueur. The restaurant was packed with tables being turned twice over! Obviously very popular and certainly not all tourists as stated in a previous review. Would definitely visit again",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We went here because the rating was so high. They were really quick getting you inside and helping you. Felt quite rushed. Seems like this is a place that tries to feed as many tourists as possible in a day. The food was good though, although we would've liked a bit more meat on our mixed grill instead of loads of fries and bread.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Visited Piatsa Gourounaki several times, with my wife or with friends. They do not accept reservations. If you go during busy time of the night, be prepared to wait for some time.The food is tastefull and reasonable priced, so are the drinks. It is worth the wait for a free table.On the other hand there is also the piatsa gourounaki express, which is about 500 meters from the other one. The difference is that at the express you don't get table service. You go to the counter order your food and drinks, pay for them and they give you buzzer for when the food is ready.Lately, most of the time we go to the express where we always find a table the food is the same.If you are in Nicosia try either and will not be disappointed.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"On the face of it this might be a pleasant and cheerful eatery. In practice it is highly frustrating. We ordered two starters (fried mushrooms and baked cheese). One came immediately, the other not at all. When I asked for the missing dish they brought it together with the two main dishes. I said something about this and was told off: ""that is how we operate here"". Both main dishes, chicken and lamb souvlaki were dry and uninteresting. The place is clearly popular with tourists for it was very crowded, perhaps because it is not at all expensive. It is also very noisy. When we go back to the city we shall not eat there.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very relaxing ! Quick service and very good prices! Our favourite is the meat platter with kebab and vegatables,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The place is nice, good environment. Service was also fast and good. Food ordered arrived within just a few minutes. Portion was huge and we even had to take away. Ouzo and desert was complimentary. A must go if visiting Nicosia. Also very inexpensive.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Great place for vegetarians and vegans! The vegetarian plate for two is a pure delight. Very attentive staff, always smiling and making sure you get what you want.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Picked this place because of TA reviews and it was even better than we had expected. My wife asked for Gin and Tonic; they had neither and so the manager went to another restaurant to get one!! Had the sharing chicken platter and a couple of beers and we were really full. So good we had a light lunch there the next day.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This place is amazing! We have been to both of their restaurants and the service has been always great and they mostly have good personality their, they are engaging and warm. The food is of good quality as well as the prices are a reasonable. Definitely highly recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Continues to be one of the best places in the old town. The service is efficient and very friendly. No thrills, but the food is good, plentiful and at very low prices. Pleasant surroundings.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Been here with family and enjoyed every single minute of it. The food and the service is very good. Especially tje chicken kebab was magnificent. Well done!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,food to service are amazing!! If you are in Nicosia and haven‚Äôt been in this place you weren‚Äôt been in Nicosia!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Frozen chips are a no no for me in Cyprus. The service here was unfriendly and the food was poor quality.,Piatsa Gourounaki

30,Good place for fast eating. Nice to go in a group with friends or family. I would visit again.......,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excelkent service, very good food great value for money! If you want like Greek food in big portions ie souvlaki, kebab, saganaki etc then this is your place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,We went to this restaurant based on its rave reviews and the fact that it servers traditional Cypriot cuisine. We got there at about 7pm and sat outside - it was quite empty. But when we left around 830 every table was busy and there was a queue for outside seating (on a Monday night) so clearly this is a popular choice for tourists and locals alike. The service was excellent - friendly waiters happy to have a chat and very responsive. They even offered us a free dessert and digestif (Matsika) which was nice. But I did expect better food - we share a pork souvlaki (single portion) and a grilled hallumi with tzatziki and to be honest I have had similar quality Cypriot food in London ! I‚Äôd happily give them a 4 for service but the average food makes it a 3 for me.,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Been there several times and always falls short on expectations. I've decided not to go again. Not that bad but it doesn't deliver on what it promises. Doesn't even come close to a Greek souvlakeria,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The best chicken souvlaki you can taste in Nicosia... Sides are also fresh and delicious... Keep it going... ;),Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"At high times this place is packed and I mean not a single seat available. And the reason is the mouthwatering, tasty food. We've stopped by in such a busy time and ordered food to go and where warned it would take a long time. To our surprise our order was done within less than 20 minutes.The mixed grill platter with a load of grilled veggies we had was just perfect, the french fries crispy, and whatever you order, you should have it with the homemade mustard sauce (find it in the appetizer or sides section of the menu).The service was quick and friendly despite the busy hour. One of the best food we had in Cyprus.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We had an amazing lunch there. Big portions of food, which was very tasty. Excellent service and very reasonable prices. Really liked it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We recently visited Nicosia and were lucky enough to do the segway tour. We asked for recommendation for an evening meal and were shown Piatsa. Fabulous meal, great staff. Loved it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We had a fabulous meal here.The service was fantastic.We had an aubergine hot starter and a very unique hummus. Fabulous breads.We had the meat mezze plate. It was fantastic. The flavours were incredible.We were given a complimentary desert. A panacotta with berry sauce. It was fabulous. Also a free liquer.All told it was a special experience. I would definitely go back when next in Nicosia.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This Greek restaurant is in the heart of the town next to Panagia Phaneromeni Church.Food is a mixture of souvlaki, kebab potato chips, vegitables and greek pitta bread.Is tasty but is not very healthy, is heavy as is oily. Service is excellent, prices reasonable and beers were cold .",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,On our wander around the south side of Nicosia we headed for this place on tge recommendation of our good friend Trip Advisor .Plenty of cold drinks first as the daytime temperature was 44c.50CL of white wine.Light starters...then ....kerboom...meat platter for two. HUGE amount of food which most tables around us boxed and took away.Good location. Nice staff. Well priced food.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This place offers amazing food and great atmosphere. It is in the middle of the old Nicosia town and surrounded by other little cafes and restaurants. The food is simple but that is what makes it awesome. 5 stars also for the design of the place. Might wait a while to get a table since it does not take reservations but it is worth it. Totally recommended.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We've just arrived back at our hotel after eating at this amazing restaurant.I've never had an experience quite like it. Fantastic food, big serves, inexpensive and simply delicious. Lots of meat options as usual but there's a great vegetarian option which basically has everything you ever dreamed of.The service is amazing. They offered us a free dessert AND a liquor after our meal. It is inexpensive, atmospheric...I really can't say enough good things about this place. The staff are amazing.The restaurant is in a great area of the city with street music and full of life. Don't miss this place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Perfect service, amazing food (and lots of it), very affordable prices... I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone looking for a nice place to have lunch",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Visited next Nicosia today from Protaras. What a pleasure to dine at this place. The best customer service we have ever experienced. Little dessert at the end of our very tasty meat platter for 2 was most welcoming. Thank you to the owner who went out of his way to explain the food to us. He must be very proud of this place and his hard working chefs and waiters. Would highly recommend. 5 star service.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I loved the tasty, fresh, homely food, also, portions are big, like the interior. totally recommend!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"While staying in Nicosia for a week, we've been to Piatsa Gourounaki three times. Yes, this is THAT delicious :D We loved it, particularly for their mezze and souvlaki and even for me, who is vegetarian, I had the most delicious food to enjoy and that's really pleasant.

The service is amazing, you feel they would do anything to make you happy. And we were given complimentary desserts. Thank you",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I loved everything in this restaurant. The kind service, the delicious and affordable food, the interior design, the music. You must try it if you are in Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you are in Nicosia, do not miss the opportunity to eat at this fabulous restaurant. The exquisite Greek bistro is nestled in a out of the way corner just off Ledrus street. The surroundings are charming and the service is delightful. This restaurant has all the pieces put together. The ambience, the service, and the food leaves nothing to hinder your bliss but an extra notch loosening your belt. Like many Cypriot entities, a warm smile and affable ways can procure on the house goodies if you are pleasant, ( we got shots of some Cyprus Brandy on the house). Do not miss this place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Amazing restaurant with delicious mediterranean food!!I often come there with my friends or/and family to have dinner and I always get out of that place with a full belly and a smile on my face!By far one of my favourites restaurant in the island of Cyprus!I would reccommend it to anyone that want to have a taste of mediterranean cousive at an affordable price and insanely good taste!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"It's a wonderful restaurant! Nice style, friendly and attentive waiters and prices are more than fair. We had the meat platter for two for 16‚Ç¨ and couldn't finish it. You also get a free desert and schnaps. Would come back any time! 100% recommendation",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Had a big beer, sparkling water, and the ""big portion"" of the lamb and veal kebabs smothered in yogurt and tomato sauce with some grilled vegetables, plus they gave me a couple of shots of zivania for free afterwards. Delicious, super filling, and less than 20 Euro for the whole thing--didn't have to eat for another eight hours after...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Was situated near the hotel, so it was not long before we could smell dinner! Tried a meat platter and were very happy with it. Lots of good meat, and all the sides were fresh and tasty. Cannot go wrong at these prices!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food was just amazing. The staff was friendly, and we didn't have to wait long before getting served.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"What a find!This place was absolutely buzzing, mainly with locals in groups of all sizes and ages. Food was fantastic, although starters and mains served together. Over 90% of menu is either suitable for coeliacs or can be amended. Owner, waiters and chefs well clued up on Coeliac disease and fastidious in their handling of the requests and questions.A truly amazing eating experience, thoroughly recommended.We went back a second time!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The best souvlaki in cyprus! Friendly, tasty, clean, good service, low price.... In one word quality",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"perfect for a late bite of food, especially if running late from a meeting or just in off the plane. Very easy to access, great food, and also an even better price. A couple of large beers and a full meal and change in a ‚Ç¨20 - perfect.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The Piatsa Gouronaki is always full, provides otoman cuisine dressed in Greek mordern hipster vibe. Best dish the cheese melted in tomato sauce, the mustard mayonese with the meat and sweet little desert as a complimentary treat for you.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Wow! Just wow! Food is sooo good! I am so full, i just could not stop eating! Waiter offered some hot cheese as a starter, it was amazing! Then meat platter for two came. And I nearly came! :D",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Loved their chicken souvlaki pitta!So tasty and accompanied with fresh salad and delicious yogurt dressing. The aubergine side salad and choriatiki salad were also amazing. Definitely recommended for quality cheap eats!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Food is very tasty and fresh. The service is at a very high level. I recommend this place. Prices are very good for the overall satisfaction you get. I will go again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The best souvlaki. Nice atmosphere. Professional service. Always fresh food. Very good prices. If you visit Nicosia, you should definitely visit this place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I went for a walk downtown, and I was surprised for how many people were waiting to join this restaurant! I got in queue and after 5 minutes I had a table. The environment was so friendly, the staff had great attitude (friendly & professionals), excellent food and very logical prices.If you passed by, get in!If you are in Nicosia, go to find it!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Been there numerous times. Always busy! Polite service, always willing to go the extra step! The food is always fresh, well cooked and for the price, second to none! Highly recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"This is the worst greek souvlaki you can have in town. Take my word as local. Amazing stuff, poor food though. Its all about appearences here and not quality. Avoid. Many other places to have good greek or cypriot kebab.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Excellent food reasonable prices fresh and delicious. Be prepared to wait as there is no reservation. Selection of food is not rich.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I had the lamb/beef kabab with tomato sauce and sour cream on a bed of pita bread. The dish has 4 good size kababs. Tasted good. Stuff are quick and nice. All in all, a nice lunch.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"One of the best restaurants I have ever been. The waiters are very helpfull and fast, the food is delicious and the price is really low. We went for lunch and got couscous and a desert on the house. Both left with a full stomach for not even 10 euro‚Äôs.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Stumbled upon this place on a day trip to Nicosia and it turned out to be one of the best we've eaten in during our stay in Cyprus. It serves traditional food, cooked well, at amazing prices. The service is excellent, friendly and helpful without being overbearing and even though we declined a look at the dessert menu we were given panacotta on the house, followed by a liqueur. We would definitely go back but unfortunately we're heading home tomorrow.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If it is s Greek lunch in the sunshine in the old town you are looking for come here. Have a starter and a pita wrap kebab if you are alone or a platter to share if not. Sit have a read, a natter, a matixa, wine or coffee. The service is perfect, very welcoming and while catering for tourists the food quality is high and the value very good.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"After taking a relaxing tour round Nicosia on a segway, we headed to this amazing restaurant on the recommendation of our tour guide - best thing we did.Service was excellent - especially given how busy they were - people were queuing on the street to get a seat (on a Wednesday night!).We opted for the chicken platter sharer - AMAZING!!I swear this is the best food we've ever had in Cyprus, we were staying in Paphos so unfortunately had to return home. But I would travel back the hours drive purely to eat here when we next return to Cyprus!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The service was excellent, George our waiter (a Gerard Butler look-alike) was incredibly friendly and funny. The food was just out of this world, their souvflaki and tzatziki sauce is just a million dollars. I strongly recommend this place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food and service. Nice atmosphere and central location in the old part of Nicosia. The portions are big, which is typical for Cyprus. We have ordered plater chicken for two, super delicious, probably for two couples but deffinetely not for 2 persons:)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great food ! Very nice staff ! Small bill ! (Dessert and digestive offered by the house) What else ?,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"A great location and good marketing have made this place extremely popular.However, having just visited, I can only report that their success is not well deserved, as far as the quality of their food goes.Please do not buy the somewhat 'Artinsinal' looks, this is nothing more than fast-food served in a reasonably nice enviroment.I found the food (in this case, Pork Souvlakia, Politiko Kebab and Leek Sausage) to be very very bland. Amongst the plainest of this Greek- (not Cypriot) style cusine that I have had on the Island.Really, deeply unimpressive - don't be misled by appearances.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Found this place highly recommended on Trip Advisor, they weren‚Äôt wrong. Best Meat Platter ever and service couldn‚Äôt be better.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We spent a day in Nicosia and I had a list of three recommended restaurants to try. Luckily the other two were closed!From the moment we sat down this was the best meal out we had in Cyprus. We got there as it opened and within 30 minutes all the tables were taken. However that didn‚Äôt change the service one bit which was excellent throughout. We ordered the meat platter for two and started ordering mains for our daughters as well. However our waiter recommended a couple of the starters instead and said it would be enough for us all. He was absolutely right and it‚Äôs rare you will be advised to order less !The food itself was excellent. My kids can be fussy but they tried and liked both the more traditional recommended dishes and the unusual ones.Highly recommended and my youngest, very discerning, daughter named it her favourite Cypriot restaurant which is good enough for me. Would suggest booking or getting there early as when we left at 8.30 there were 10-15 people waiting to get a table, on a quiet Tuesday.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Our friend recommended this place and we really enjoyed it. We took meat platter for 2, which is very big with various selection of meat, we could barely eat it. We also took cheese in pastry, which is now my favorite food in the world. Greek draught beer finished it all. We also got some liquor and desert on the house. Very recommended to visit. Best value for price.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The best grilled food you can find in Nicosia at the best price. Self service and full service restaurants. Plenty of food and great quality.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"It was just perfect. I usually don‚Äôt leave reviews but the food and service was so so so good that they deserve it. Great food and friendly service. Although they were super busy at lunch time, you don‚Äôt feel left out as they give you all attention you need.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"One of my friend from Cyprus took me to this place. I loved everything - from food (souvlaki is amazing!), little dessert, that I found out, is given for free but you can donate some money for it to charity (amazing, right?) to environment and staff.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I had been in Cyprus for nearly a week without eating a souvlaki. It was time to get my kebab on. Checked trip advisor, found this place. Glad we did!Friendly staff ensured an immediate table, fast drinks and beetroot hummus with warm Pita bread. The kids were impressed even though they claim not to like beetroot.We then shared a mixed meat platter for two (ha! Four of us couldn't finish it) with souvlaki, kebab, barbecued vegetables, tzatziki and chips.Greek salad came with a whacking hunk o' feta sat on top of the sweet little cucumbers, dressed with some surprise capers (not sure if authentic but again, the kids approved, weirdly).Complimentary panacotta style desserts and some kind of pleasant herbal tasting digestif later, we were fortified and happy for under ‚Ç¨10 each including drinks.This place deserves its success.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very rarely does a restaurant achieve such excellence when the prices are soo reasonable...I was thoroughly entertained for nearly 2 hours whilst hogging a table as an endless wave of people turned up to feast..Luckily I drank a large quantity of local wine which eased my guilt....ALL the staff are warm and welcoming....the traditional food is simple and DELICIOUS...decent size portions too...the free dessert and shot of liquor is just an added bonus...In every city I strive to find the perfect place to hang out...and this is it...more importantly it was packed with families..tourists..students and businessmen...as everyone can afford to enjoy this oasis...The hardest part is giving up your table when you can't eat or drink anymore....,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I had already seen this restaurant on TripAdvisor before arriving in Nicosia, but my parents and I stumbled across it by complete chance. Decor is lovely, very traditional - good choice of indoor and outdoor seating. We were seated and served very swiftly, and our food came out really quickly. The food was faultless!!! My dad said it was the best restaurant he‚Äôs EVER been in!! My mum and Dad ordered the ‚Ç¨17 meat platter for two (a large selection of meats, a pile of seasoned chips, as well as pita bread and roast vegetables), it was huge and of such good quality, they loved it all - incredible value for money, especially for the city centre. I ordered a halloumi pitta (not too big, good size, nice and warm) and roast vegetables (not too oily, huge portion, well cooked), so I was very pleased, but then the owner came out and said: ‚ÄúI see you are a vegetarian, please have this couscous, free of charge‚Äù. How sweet of him!! And I think it was the best couscous I‚Äôve ever had!! Cannot recommend this place highly enough!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We had a great meal experience at the restaurant but the only bad thing about the restaurant is that it was a bid crowded. Rather than that the foods were okay.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Eating at Piatsa Gourounaki was a very cool and intense experience. It's a very busy place and popular with locals. The waiters are energetic and attentive. The food was delicious and abundant. Offering free schnapps and dessert was very cute. Only minus: french fries offered as part of otherwise local dishes (but that's so common in Cyprus).,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,In a plate or in pita bread the food was delicious. Large plates with chiken lamb or pork or in a lovely flat pita with the local sauces. Very delicious ! Great service! Nice seeting inside or out. The atmosphere is very nice. The dessert and apres meal liquore on them. Great brak from the city.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Food was delicious and excellent value for money. The waiters were very attentive and even offered a free dessert! Get the platter for two like everyone else- I dare you to finish it all! If you are in Nicosia it is a must- worth the visit!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Food was very good, prices more than ok. Baby friendly, we went with our 1 year old. The service is also very good and fast.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very friendly and modern environment, happy staff and the most amaziiing food! The prices are veeeeryy good!!! Sometimes though, if it is really full, you need to wait a little, BUT it worth it and you can guess that from the people!! Anddd they give you a free dessert in the end! Lovee it‚ù§Ô∏è",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We searched the best restaurant in Nicosia and looks like we found it. Everything was amazing, from starters to wine and main course. The portions are huge, we couldn't finish all the food we ordered, but they will pack the remaining food to take away if you want to. I definitely recommend this place. As a plus, they offer a digestion liqueur and dessert on the house :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Went for lunch with some friends. This place was originally recommended by another friend. We ordered the meat platter to have a chance to try a variety of the food.It was amazing. The chiken souvlaki marinated and tender, kebabs filled with spices that make your taste buds smile from the flavour. Definately recommend this place to everyone for lunch and dinner. The only thing I guess you need to know in advance is that you cannot make a booking and its jammed packed most of the time and for good reason so be prepared to wait for a table. Its totally worth it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,You can try local food and beverages. Prices are ok and the staff is very polite. Not big menu but tastes great.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We just strolled by and were attracted by the nice setting of the restaurant. The restaurant was packed, asked for a table and were told to come back in about 15min. When we came back, the waiter recognised us at once and showed us to our table.A mixed meat plate for two with salad was more than enough to feed the three of us. The waiter even discouraged us from ordering more and he was right. We even took some of the food home for next days lunch. The food was not only yummy, but there was a desert and digestive on the house.The staff was friendly and attentive and it is truly a place to visit again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"The location right by a construction site is not attractive, but it does mean there is no traffic passing by.We had a fresh Greek salad and a kebab in pita wrap with fries. You have to go inside to pay and get a pager which lets you know when the food is ready. It did not take long and the prices are very reasonable.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The perfect place for you lunch in Cyprus..the stuff are great..must see place..local beer and local food are delicious,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Nice friendly staff. A safe bet if you‚Äôre walking around in Nicosia looking for a place to eat. Nearly everyone there finds it from TripAdvisor. They‚Äôve done well with marketing.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"When you arrive at this restaurant, you think: it is big and busy and it doesn't look like a traditionnal tavern. You also have to be patient as you might have to wait to be seated because they don't take any bookings.But once you are seated at your table, you will forget everything. You will be welcomed by a very nice, helpful, polite staff. The food is really tasty with a nice selection of cold and warm mezes (try the aubergines and the hummus with beetroot), very moist chicken souvlaki, my lamb was also really tasty. Nice deserts and the digestifs were on the house.I'd definitely recommend this restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The stuff is very friendly and attentive. The food is amazing and I would definitely recommend to every who wants to try a good souvlaki. The price is very reasonable and at the end of your meal they treat you with a traditional dessert. The restaurant is very clean.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The staff were so friendly, even when looking at the menu before going in they weren‚Äôt pushy. The chef came out and took our order, telling us what was best. Food was tasty and there was lots of it for such a good price. Can‚Äôt recommend enough! Thank you for a lovely evening.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Staff was super cool and fast! Food was out of this world good, had the chicken and mixed big plates! Couscous appetizer(SO GOOD)! Comp desert was also yummy and our waiter also gave us a comp shot of the local desert brandy which was delicious as well! All in all great food!!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Been here every summer since 2015 and it's perfect every time. The lamb chops are thumbs up including the portion size. Love the place.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Situated in the redevelopment area near entry to Ledra Street, this first visit to this Mediterranean Restaurant was indeed most impressive and could not be faulted one bit.Visiting mid-week for lunch the restaurant had good ambience and a casual feel - greeted by very friendly and attentive staff. I had a chicken souvla which came with a plentiful amount of chips. The chicken was indeed flavoursome as no doubt it probably had been marinated and had a thyme finishing to the overall taste. This dish was served on hot Greek bread and vegetables. A salad was also ordered which comprised of shredded cabbage which I enjoyed very much which again was plentiful. I also sampled the lamb / veal kebab - again flavoursome and extremely good. A complimentary creamy based jelly was topped with some syrupy jam flavouring which was a good finish to the main meal.I can see why this restaurant has a very high ranking on TripAdvisor for the quality and quantity in respect of the food that it serves - this is well deserved and indeed it‚Äôs very difficult to find on this island. In addition to this it was also extremely reasonable to eat here and you really cannot go wrong with all the attributes that one can say about this restaurant. A real find and I will definitely be re-visiting on our next trip to the island.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Very good service and fast although the restaurant was packed.Big dishes with quality meat well cooked and nice salads. Nice live atmosphere with popular greek music.,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,Super friendly stuff. Very fresh and good food. Big portions!!! Good prices!!! Desert on the house!!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"well, its number one so we had to try it. Admittedly super friendly staff and clearly a haunt of the younger crowd. The price point was low and I suspect that's part of the attraction. The salad was good as was the vegetarian bake starter. The main event was the meat platter for two. This came with soggy oily chips. The meats were a bit tough and some of them were of the reconstituted type. Each to their own but I would not return. The quality was just not there for me.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Decided to eat here as rated number 1 on TripAdvisor and I can clearly see why!!!The food was incredible. Fresh, excellent value for money and well cooked.The service was excellent. The waiters were very attentive and helpful.We had the big plates with a mix of chicken, pork and local sausages. All were served with a large Cypriot pitta (which was beautiful), seasoned potatoes and a small salad with Tzatziki. We shared a platter of halloumi and a local cheese baked with honey and balsamic vinegar. These plates were approximately ‚Ç¨8 each with the whole meal for four coming to ‚Ç¨50 - including drinks!After the meal we were offered a complimentary desert and shot of Zavania (a local spirit made with grapes) each.I would highly recommend this restaurant! If you are in the area or passing by, definitely consider eating here!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This place is truly amazing - atmosphere, food and service. Giorgos, the waiter, was so nice that we were actually speechless. It was as if he was reading our minds. The cherry on top is, that the prices are very fair. I highly recommend this place to everybody who visits Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Lovely place with great staff. Had a wonderful lunch with a family of four and enjoyed every single bite of it. Unfortunately this place does not serve coffee, but hey, nobody is perfect.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,Excellent food. Nice staff. Cant ask for more. Hiwever it has become quite popular so expect some queing time before sitting at a table,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Didn't really want to go here tonight but very glad I did. The place is a vibrant hot spot in downtown Nicosia and if you want a table be there for 7pm when it opens as it was chocca really quickly, with good reason. The staff were actually helpful and intent on helping rather than screwing you out of the good stuff. They seem to enjoy working there as much as the customers enjoy eating. I had a starter and shared the meat platter for 2 which was plenty. The food was of an excellent standard as was the staff. The price for all this was less than ‚Ç¨30 between us for 2 starters and the meat platter. Cracking value and cracking food. A must visit if in Nicosia",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,What a great place! We were in Nicosia for the day and stopped in for lunch (3 adults and a child) - the food and service was amazing! The staff went out of their way to make us welcome. Would highly recommend!,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"What a place this is. Walked past the night before and it was heaving, so went for lunch the following day. They didn‚Äôt open until 12.30pm, so beware of the 12.00time on the website. The staff were extremely attentive and knowledgable, and the food was plentiful and absolutely delicious. We ordered a meat platter for 2 at ‚Ç¨16.50, with 2 sticks of pork souvlaki, 2 sticks of chicken souvlaki, 2 chicken kebabs, 1 lamb kebab, 2 chicken souvlaki wrapped in bacon, chips, pitta and oven baked vegetables. It was awesome, and washed down with a litre of wine cost a mere ‚Ç¨28.50, which included a free sweet and free liqueur. Fantastic food, fantastic value and fantastic service. The only small issue we had was that the chips and vegetables went cold very quickly. Could do with pre heated platters or wooden trays.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We ordered the lamb souvlaki and lamb kebab for me and for my vegetarian husband we chose the warm starter as a main dish (Mbougiournti with Mboukovo -Spicy), Greek salad, fried potatoes with oregano, mushroom with parsley sauce. All were yummy. The Mbougiournti was devine. The lamb (both dishes) was yummy. Good quality lamb. Mushroom was good because of the sauce, that parsley sauce is really good, I would spread it on any food, its super tasty. The Greek salad was fresh with capers and the feta cheese was good. We paid 22 euros. The music is energetic. The atmosphere is refreshing. You must visit. The only thing I can ask for is more vegetarian dishes as good as the Mbougiournti.I love how they structured their menu so one can order one skewer of kebab (of either chicken, pork or lamb) and one of skewer of souvlaki (of either chicken, pork or lamb). Five stars from me.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"At this price - this is undoubtedly one of the best cheap eats in the world. Superb service, whether it be waiters or the proprietor wearing a funny hat, food is world class, and very fast. We have been so many times when we visit Nicosia - it‚Äôs almost become the number 1 immediate choice to head to every time ..,",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,I suggest this place to those who want to eat typical food. The price is very good and the quality the same.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The place was buzzing as I passed by chance on my day out in Nicosia, even though the streets were quiet, so I thought it must be ok and stepped inside. What a surprise - it wasn't just ok, it was excellent. I had a delicious lunch with a nice glass of wine and they even gave me a complimentary dessert and a little digestif. Thank you!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"So, in order for me to give a 5 star to a restaurant, it must, absolutely must have all of the following :1. Good food and portions2. Great service3. Low or reasonable prices4. Clean and inspiring venue supported by good music.Well, Piatsa Gourounaki has all of the above. It serves all the traditional Greek - Cypriot dishes presented in a modern manner. The prices are very reasonable with really good portions. The service is great, fast, everyone smiles and what an amazing attitude towards kids. Even in their busiest hour, all, and i mean all members of the staff would stop for a few seconds and play with our kids or smile or say a nice word to them. Even when our children were clearly in their way.The place is very nice, traditional and modern at the same time, great music plays joyfully in the background and of course very clean.Be warned though, if you arrive at 8-8:30 at night, prepare to wait to be seated",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food and value for money..very good service, helpful and polite staff I defenetly recommend it..",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This cafe was recommended by Tripadvisor.com and it was the best choice for lunchtime. The food was just right and lager was cold and crispy. Freshly fried meat was simply perfect. Service was also flawless: during lunch we were asked 5 (!) times are we ok. And it wasn't intrusive.Thumbs up for black stylish interior and uniform.,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"It is just another fast food. People are smoking all over the place. Services are average, few things to eat. When the restaurant is crowded space to stay on your chair or to move around is scarce. I do not recommand this place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"There is a reason why this restaurant is rated No1 - it is simply the best.My wife and I ate here twice during a 5 day stopover in January.Staff are warm and friendly,the food is great and not expensive.Order the platter for two, a Greek salad, a cold beer or a small carafe of wine and enjoy.Cheers Graeme",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Tasty food, very dedicated service clean restaurant. We enjoyed this place. Unfortunately they are not serving coffee after the meal, which we received very disappointing. Had to change to an other place to get our cup of coffee.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,Excellent food....very polite staff....our order was delivered very fast...in 5-10min...we had desert on tje house,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"There is a great variety of Greek fresh food. Very good quality and very tasty .We were a group of 8 people of different ages. My father who is 78 was with us. All of us enjoyed the food. We ordered among others souvlaki chicken and pork, kebab on a platter,potatoes and Greek salad . We drank soft drinks and zivania (a traditional local alcoholic drink).At the end they offered us (free of charge) a kind of sweet as a dessert. Excellent service and cheap prices. I recommend it!!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Not the 1st time coming to this place and definitely not the last! Perfect food, atmosphere and the most polite staff you‚Äôll find in a restaurant! Try chicken souvlaki and the sausage! It taste takes me back to Salonica in my years as a studentüòä",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Amazing local dishes, mostly pork souvlaki (kebab) and potatoes, grilled dishes, salads and awesome desserts. Friendly environment and normal prices. A place to enjoy good food and beer !",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The food is simply delightful. The portions are more than enough. Piatsa Gourounaki is a must visit!!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Despite the fact that we went late to the restaurant we received pretty quickly our order and the service provided was really careful of our needs.The waitress helped immediately even for our request to bring leftovers (the food was amazing but we ordered a little bit too much).The place is friendly and quiet.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I cannot think of anyone i know who does't like a good souvlaki. Either chicken or pork, if the meat is in good quality, fresh and someone behind the swinging doors of a busy kitchen knows how to cook it, then you've got nothing to worry about your Friday night meal, Saturday or Sunday lunch or your everyday kebab cravings.Simple menu, straightforward way to order, good choices of sides, plenty of people to 'bother' if you need extended clarification of the products or any other inquries and of course always with a big smile to help you.Now the food is simply, delightful. Pork or chicken both make your appetite elevate while their honey-mustard sauce gives you a good shivers. Honestly the best honey-mustard sauce i've ever had. Period. Yummy french fries, good portion of salad while i personally could have asked for more pita, but again the portions are more than enough to fill your empty belly.The only thing i could not hang on to is the dessert which i personally don't think its the best choice to serve after such a flavourful meal. But this is subjective.Afterall, Piatsa Gourounaki is a must visit. Situated in the heart of Nicosia and now an express place serves also the busier customers within a mile of the main restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,we went there for lunch on sunday .. the restaurant is very nice and clean .. the staff are very polite .. butt the food is way too average .. ordered the mix grill ... worst pork and chicken souvlaki ever eaten .. nothing compared to a cypriot pork souvlaki ... also the fries had too much salt .. the greek salad was very nice,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I'm living in Cyprus for many years and i can say that Piatsa Gourounaki is one of the best places in Nicosia for eating and enjoying the atmosphere. I recommend it.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went here for our evening meal, the food was really good. We had the Chicken platter,salad and olives. I believe it is really good value for the money , the staff are friendly without being too in your face.top tip either try and book a table or get there close to 7 , as that is when it opens for the evening , and it gets really busy!!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Very good food. Disappointing dot to have guros as well. Service could be slow but its not bad. Nice setup especially for outside sitting. A little bit pricy.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Was visited so many times and it is highly recommended. Good environment, good service and delicious food. The phrase ‚Äúvalue for money‚Äù describes best this restaurant! Everyone wears a big, warm smile and does his utmost to ensure 100% satisfaction.",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"Our family visited Nicosia for the day- lunch at Piatsa Gourounaki. We had the chicken platter and cheese pastry. For the type of fast food dishes they serve, they do it extremely well: the food was appetising and seasoned in a balanced manner with being too salty or sweet; prices are surprisingly low for the portions that you get (especially with the platters).",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Hospitality and food was beautiful. We had the chicken platter for 2 but our teenage son helped us with this too as well as his own chicken souvlaki ! House wine was by the carafe and we had 2 small carafes throughout-the meal.We were offered a small desert on the house and a nip of local lacquer.

50,"My Greek skills are still beyond bad, so I can‚Äôt tell you what we ate, but it was delicious. The restaurant was busy but the staff was still super friendly and patient, telling us what the dishes were. We got one ‚Äúplatter‚Äù and a couple starters all to share. Would‚Äôve loved to have more people so we could try more things but as it was we were stuffed! When we finished they brought us a dessert and digestive on the house.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,tasty meal though not as good as last year. last year the food was tastier and plentiful. too oily and nothing has changed on the menu,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We sat near the entrance on a high table.Great food with a good vibrant atmosphere. Service is efficient and the ambience of the restaurant is modern.The only negative comment would be that next time we would not choose to sit next to the door as it was busy and the Hot wind kept entering with every new guest.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I love this place! If you can‚Äôt decide on what to eat and have no dietary restrictions come here! Great pork, lamb and drinks! The atmosphere at the main restaurant is awesome! And for quick service go to the location on Lidra Street, plenty of seating here!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"We absolutely love the meat platter for 2: moist delicious chicken, pork skewers, then kebab made with ground chicken and veggies, and one with ground lamb, then bacon wrapped chicken! The equally best part is the delicious baked veggies of zucchini, eggplant, red, yellow peppers....divine! Pita bread and French fries too! We talk about this restaurant when back home in Canada and can't wait to eat here again when in Cyprus! Don't go to the new ""express"". Piazza Gouranaki as they don't serve the veggies only a cabbage salad in its place...no comparison. The original location is best!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I usually write comments on hotels but I was amazed by the quality and the service in Piatsa Gourounaki and decided to write couple of nice words about this place!

50,"This is such a popular place that people were queuing up to get in before it had opened! It's fun, noisy and lively - a great ambience! The portions are huge, and made for sharing, and there are so many delicious sounding options on the menu that it's hard not to over order! One word of advice - don't order extra fries (fried potatoes) or bread, as all the dishes seem to come with fries and bread! Great attentive staff too, in spite of the fact that they are all rushed off their feet!",Piatsa Gourounaki

I finished with a very good sausage, chili pepper and onions. Personnel is very kind, the cost is unbelievably low for the food quality and quantity. Unmissable restaurant!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Super busy but great service & atmosphere. Although the platters looked fantastic value, I don‚Äôt eat certain meats so decided to order dishes separately.

40,Visited the place at least 6 times in the last 12 months. Always coming back. Lots of food for the price you pay. Well prepared meals serviced in a reasonable time from friendly staff. Only negative is that the meat is imported ( not sure about this) and is not as tasty as local meat,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,My husband and I were in Nicosia for 4 days and visited this restaurant 3 times for dinner as it was so good! The staff were incredibly friendly and the food was delicious. The chef briefly sat with us and was an absolute delight. This is a can't miss choice if you ask me. Over the course of three meals we sampled a number of items and they were all exceptional.Our favourite dish was the chicken souvlaki but the Greek salad was a close second! Check it out. You will be delighted.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Having read the reviews of this restaurant we had high expectations and they lived up to it. Great location in the centre of the city with a lovely atmosphere. The staff were really helpful and friendly and Haris came to help us decide. The spicey veg and cheese sauce starter was fab and new to us. The meat platters were generous and well cooked with cooked with lots of vegetables. Great local wine and in fact a super meal.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We visited Piatsa Gouranaki on account of it being no 1 on Tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed. The food was great and the prices were out of this world...so cheap. For two people with alcohol we only paid 15 EUR. The place does get very busy and it's a fast turnaround. They say you can't reserve so best to get there at 7 when it opens. The staff are lovely and whilst we were there the chef/owner was out mingling with the guests and he was great fun. Will probably be visiting again before I leave and taking other friends.My friend with me tried their bacon and feta dip and really liked it.,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"There are two 'Piatsa Gourounaki' restaurants, the second one is kind of self-service and you're serviced right away; the quality is exactly the same. At the main restaurant you'll have to wait 10-20 minutes to be seated, especially on weekends, but the quality and quantity of food worth it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Food was excellent. Tasty and high quality food was served from cheerful waiters. Prices were normal.,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,After seeing this place on TripAdvisor we decided to give it a go.On arrival we had to wait 25 mins for a table as it's very popular. The thing you need to be aware of is when there are two of you and a table for four is free you won't get it!!! It's like for like numbers wise.The food is quality and we had the highly recommended meat platter for two.The food is fresh and comes really quickly.Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.,Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"We went here for a late lunch whilst on a day trip to Nicosia.We had the large 300g portion of chicken souvlaki and the 300g portion of lamb souvlaki. The meals were huge served with chips, tomato, tzatziki, pita bread and onions.The chicken was seasoned, soft and delicious, however the lamb was tough and was not the best. I would not recommend the lamb.There are two locations, one, near the bus terminal, where we went, and the other off Kendra street in the old town. The later restaurant does dinner, the former lunch.Please note the location near the bus terminal is self service. Would recommend the chicken but not the lamb.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We took a chicken souvlaki plate and a Greek salad. It was more than enough for two persons. The food was brilliant! I tested different kinds of chicken one by one and was amazed by the taste of it. The sauces for the chicken were even better. No words to explain!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Food is good, service is fast, prices are fare. Meat platter with kebab and souvlaki (both pork and chicken) is a real bargain. Salads are fresh and starters are also good. Only comment is that the restaurant does not take reservations so people have to be patient after they put their names on the list kept by the guy in the entrance. A good choice in one of the most popular spots of the famous Onasagorou street.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Maybe the best meat eatery at Nicosia. Though almost always crowded, the service is very good by the young people working at the restaurant, eager to inform you about the food and to stop you ordering much more than you can eat! Excellent quality of anything that we had ordered. Prices: you will not find better value for money in Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"We have visited Piatsa Gourounaki on quite a few occasions now.We stumbled across it when we first moved here and will be ever glad we did.Walking down the street you will wonder what all the activity is on this corner. There is often a crowd of people just milling around, all to happy to wait to eat here. The wait is never too long and oh so worth it.First impressions count!I was so pleased to see a restaurant that was exceptionally clean and well presented. This has always been the case on every visit. Standards are high.The waiters are always helpful and will happily recommend dishes or explain things to you.The platters are a firm favourite of ours and we find that a platter for 2, along with a bowl of salad is often enough to feed our young family. This makes a meal out extremely affordable, in fact an absolute bargain!We have recommended Piatsa Gourounaki to many friends and have always received messages of thanks for a great recommendation.So if you are in Nicosia or even on the island make time to eat at Piatsa Gourounaki.We will certainly be back. ‚ù§Ô∏è",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visited mid afternoon on a Saturday in late August solely on the Trip Advisor recommendations and are delighted we did.We were returning South from a visit to the occupied North of the city and chose this restaurant because of its proximity to Ledra Street.The restaurant is easy to find and is situated on a bend in the road opposite a small supermarket. Be aware that the signage for the restaurant is all in Greek and its anglicised name is not shown anywhere.We were a group of 5 and on arrival were greeted by an exceptionally friendly waiter who seemed genuinely disappointed that we would have to wait for a table in side. We were offered a table outside in the shade at which to wait which was a welcome respite from the heat and sun from a August afternoon.The restaurant has a number of tables immediately outside the front of it and then about 6 higher tables situated down an alley leading to the main entrance. All of these are shaded and were occupied when we arrived.Inside is an air conditioned room that has about 40 covers. Again on our arrival at about 14:30hrs all were occupied.The menu is relatively basic and is focused on a meat theme though there are options for vegetarians.Our waiter, who was exceptional, talked us through the menu and recommended that we have two of the platters (‚Ç¨16.50) each and a salad as our main meal. This we did and it proved an excellent suggestion. We had one meat platter and one chicken platter. The meat was quite simply stunning and the chicken was so light and moist that it is probably the best we have had on the island. The chicken souvlaki was delightful.All of the waiting staff that we experienced were superb, professional, friendly, attentive and very responsive. They were a credit to the business.There is no desert menu or coffees, but after we were offered complimentary desserts and digestifs. A very kind touch.All in all a delightful experience and we can see why this has such a high rating. If it were possible to give more than 5 * we would!Some advice - they don't take phone bookings and so I can imagine at peak times they will be very busy, justifiably so, and you may therefore be prepared to wait for a table.Trip Advisor, thanks for this recommendation. It was exceptional and we definitely want to pass it on.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,I came across with this place by pure coincidence walking around the city and I absolutely loved it. 100% recommended.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We visited this restuarant for dinner food is great especially the souvlaki chicken or pork the quality is very good large selection to order from service is exceptional it's always packed if your looking for good kebab or traditional food highly recommended,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food, great atmosphere, great prices, great staff and service, the sort of place you always want to find in a city. This place is what it is, this is grill/barbecue/street food and they do it spot on. We were lucky and got a table (just) at 7.30pm on a Saturday night, after that time it was constantly queued but moved fairly fast as tables turned quite quickly but you were never rushed at all at any point, in fact the staff insist you have the complimentary desert and drink, so they are certainly not rushing you away. And once again...too much food, well this is Cyprus eh! Like I said...simple...just go!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This place is always packed with people. You are lucky if you walk in and there is a table free. The food here is very very good. If you do see an opening take it! They know what they're doing.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,The place is a small cosy simple place to eat quickly nice charhcoal meat. Waiters are very helpful and polite and the food is cheap. Its location is in the heart of onasagorou street therefore very convenient to find.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very tasty food, a lot of options, satisfactory quantily, very good and fast service. What really impressed me was their ""leftovers strategy"". They dont through the leftovers in the garbage as the rest do. They collect them and when the restaurant closes they feed the cats of the area. For sure i will visit them again :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very tastefull food, especially the souvlaki and the kebab. Very good service and a very good free-dessert!",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Nothing special. Fast greek food. Not even close to cypriot tastes. Prefer to take kebab from anyone else.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Visited last night. Good food, ample qualities, very polite staff and if u go a bit early the wait is not long as they take reservations. We had the meat platter for two plus a salad and it was enough. The prices are decent",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Fast food. Nothing more. Nothing less. Tasteful. Takes time to prepare at rush hour. Worth a try. It's definitely not a restaurant.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great food. Quick service. Great prices. Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious. Packed every time I go.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you come at night, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes, but the place runs like a well oiled machine. üëåüç¥üëçüåû",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Really busy but By far the best for meat lovers, we ordered the meat platter to share and that was more than enough for the two of us. Came with free bread and free dessert and shot afterwards.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent and quick service despite being full. Some of the waiters could be more smiley but it looked like a busy night for them, so nothing to blame. The food was absolutely tasty like always and surprisingly cheap for the quality and quantity we had. A special bravo to our waiter Panagiotis who was very willing help and the only staff member who was always smiley.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great service with big portions and very tasty dishes. I recommend the chicken souvlaki and the amazing honey mustard sauce.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"delicious food, better make a reservation as it is packed, good service and great chicken souvlaki try it",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We bumped into this location and what a great finding. First off the service from top to bottom was outstanding and made us feel like part of the family. Welcomed with a nibble, had drinks a share platter and salad which were large enough for both of us and really tasty. The main person also took a minute to talk us through what we were about to eat. Our opinion about the restaurant up to that point was settled: fantastic! but to top it off they surprised us with some desserts and aperitifs on the house. Could not but praise it. We'll be back and everyone that visits Nicosia should too.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"You may need to wait in line to get a table (5-10 min max) but it's surely worth it. The food is very tasty and well cooked at reasonable prices, and the service is excellent. We usually get the meat platter which is more than enough for two people.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"If you like your meat, this is definitely the place to go!I shared the meat platter with a friend and struggled to finish (and I have a big appetite)! There was lots of variety and the meat was cooked so well. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you got.Staff were very friendly and helpful - I can't wait to go back!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The best place I've been in Nicosia for a while now. Great location in the heart of the old city, very busy but well managed (waiting list system), well attended by helpfull staff, fast service, brilliant (!!!) food - we had two mixed grill platters between 5 of us, salads, wine, beer etc. - unbelievable price, working out at under eu14 pp, including complementary deserts and tip!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Stopped here for dinner with friends and ordered a meat platter. Portions are HUGE, so bring an appetite. Our waiter gave us a local dessert and after dinner drink to sample - and I'll pass on the dessert in the future, but the drink was really nice. I have no clue what he called it, but it's a local Cypriot traditional drink. Tasty, but only for sipping unless the goal is to get tipsy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,A very good choice if you want to eat souvlaki at the old town of Nicosia. They do not accept reservations though so go early before you are really hungry! I recommend the mix platter!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"food is very good, nice place. Very nice staff. Large portions of food. Very nice place to go in Nicosia located in city center.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,I am in love with this place but it has limited options for lactose intolerant people and GI sensitive people! The platters are perfect for 2-3 persons especially when they are hungry!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Nice food fast service and professional stuff. I ve been to this place a few times. Always the service and the food is exceptional as well as the prices. I definitely recommend the meat platter which it has a variety of grilled meats and potatoes.The prices reflect the service and the quality.4/5 because they take no reservations and sometimes there is a waiting line. But if you go there and wait for a bit they will arrange a table for you.,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,They got really good menu. We ordered and liked a lot the meat mixed platter with the greek salad. Perfect service!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I don't dare to call this a tavern as it's quite stylish and has an ambiance of a hip cafe. We have noticed all kinds of people in there - big families of locals, tourists wandering around Lidras, people from other places in Cyprus (us). Meals were delicious and generous, service was very welcoming and fast. We ordered a salad, mixed grill and chicken kebab with yogurt - all very tasty and very generously portioned, except maybe a salad. The staff was happy to accommodate our special requests, fries were substituted with more grilled veggies at no extra cost. It was nice to find out that the place has traditional Greek starters and Greek pitta is served with meals. Unfortunately we did not try the starters as the mixed grill was already too much for 2.The only complain I have is that this place doesn't serve coffee which would be very nice to finish off too big a meal which made us sleepy :)To sum up - huge mixed grill + separate serving of kebab in Pitta + salad + soft drinks = EUR 25. Now we're talking value for money!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very reasonable prices, with huge and extremely tasty portions! The service was amazing and even brought us a local dessert and a shot to have before we go (even though i couldn't down the shot and ended up sneezing it out). They totally deserved that 30% tip on the bill (usually i leave about 8-10%). Totally recommend this place and will most certainly go again!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Best restaurant in Nicosia. Excellent food. Only problem you can't book and sometimes have to wait for a table.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Had many pleasant nights at Piazza Gourounaki... good value and excellent service... a Nicosia institution,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Can't even begin to describe how good the meat / vegetarian platters in this place are! There was many kind of meats and delicious dips, my favourite was absolutely wonderful honey mustard sauce. Service was very friendly, even a bit over the top. We got free desserts and digestives.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Undoubtedly this is the best restaurant in Cyprus, considering the value for money. Greek cuisine is not my favorite, but every time I am in Nicosia I go to this restaurant. Usually, we order meat platter for two, salad (my favorite is tomatoes and capers), sometimes baked vegetables with spicy cheese and wine in a carafe. The quality of meat, its seasoning, appetizers and serving time are excellent. At a price of 15 Euro you get a great platter of different meats, with toppings (chips, grilled vegetables, dips). I am very happy that there is in Cyprus restaurant, where I can invite friends and be sure that the quality of the meal will be high.",Piatsa Gourounaki

The food was brilliant, my friend is vegetarian and loved her platter, the chicken was divine. Service excellent, lovely staff. Place was spotless. Atmosphere was buzzing. Best to arrive early as it gets really busy and I don't think you can book. Thank you for a lovely eating experience, will be back often and will sing your praises to all.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Lucky to get a table since went early otherwise would have been hard. Food was good grill food. Service was swift and friendly. Prices were good. Shall go again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"You can't leave cyprus without having gone here! The food and service is awesome.Huge portions, definitely recommend the platters which are big enough for more than two people. Salads are super tasty and everything is really great value for money.The service is extremely friendly. I believe you can't book a table but if you go, you do get a table very quickly.Will definitely be going here more than once whilst here. And will always bring people here when I visit the island with friends.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visited on a Sunday night, the restaurant was almost full just after opening. Ordered the meat platter and several side dishes including generous helpings of olives and Pitta for two which was more than enough. The meat platter is a must try. Overall excellent service, great food and great value for money (entire meal for two was less than 30 EUR) There is even a complimentary dessert and shot to round off the meal. Would strongly recommend.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"It was okay , the only thing that i didn't like it was that it was to crowded and the toilets wasn't very clean!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We came to Cyprus last year and this restaurant was a real hit with the family. Back this week with my son and can confirm that it is just as good as it was last year, maybe even better. Try the chicken drumsticks (boneless) which are our favourite but any of the platters are fabulous too.Nice to see it is still as busy too - worth waiting if you can't get seated right away!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"... and good food to a decent price. Good coffee next door, but no coffee at the piatsa gourounaki itself.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Staff super helpful in assisting us in choosing what to order, quick, cheap and delicious. Would highly recommend :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We arrived at Piatsa Gourounaki by chance, and were pleasantly surprised.Although sat in a back table outside, the atmosphere was good. Service was friendly, quick and efficient.The food was great! We had a platter for two, lamb souvlaki and Greek salad. Everything was tasty and delicious. Portions sizes are large.The price also surprised for the good - 42.5 euro for the above plus drinks for three people.A complimentary dessert and Mastika liqueur completed a great experience.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Where do I start.... We arrived as a party of 7, seated straight away by the very friendly chef.We were then served our drinks, and ordered our food, we wanted to try a bit of everything, and so we chose to have 3 platters, meat, chicken and vegetable.The food was outstanding! The servings were very large, the staff are very friendly.. Literally cannot fault the place.If we have time, we definitely will be back!No wonder its number 1!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Lovely place, yummy food. Definitely worth its money. The food was fantastic and the service was great. Both the vegetarian as well as the meat options are absolutely delicious. The waiters really take care of you and dessert is on the house! And an absolute plus, if you cannot finish the giant amount of yummy food they serve, they have no problem with you taking it home in a doggy bag!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Staff was super friendly and recommended great food. It's a very busy place so plan some waiting time, too",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you must wait 10-20 minutes, then by all means do. The vegetarian platter is not to be missed, even if you're not a vegetarian. The meat platter is meat in heaven. The staff are very kind and helpful and energetic. The price is affordable too. You may be offered sweets mhalabia on the house!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"It is worth to have one meal in Nicosia in this restaurant. It is always full of people, but there are plenty of seats. Good food. Went there with my friends at 10pm and we can still get some hot food there. One bad thing is that it is not that quiet, so If you enjoy a more luxurious, then try somewhere. This is more likely a civilian or local restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Lovely place near the border crossing at ledra street. Found it by accident and so Glad we did. Platters were amazing. Ambience is good. Service is very friendly.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Recommended by local border police, absolute top pick and a very friendly welcome. Al fresco setting... pretty busy but worth waiting for 5 min. Great conversation with the staff too, but particularly great food (picked the lamb/veal kebab and charcoal chicken pita) and truly good! Added a Keo beer and the bill was so low I thought they only charged the beer. Under 9 euro's and additionally got a desert and a mastiha on the house without asking for it... truly surprising, understand why this is the #1 restaurant in Nicosia... will be back!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food is simply always delicious at extremely reasonable prices comparing to other similar restaurant in Nicosia. Location is also nice, in the heart of the old city of Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We saw this restaurant on trip advisor and found it to be just as excellent as reported. The waiter was great fun and very helpful and the food was amazing! We had the meat and chicken platters between the four of us but it had us beat. They offered a container and carrier bag to take home. We were given complimentary desserts and our lovely waiter also brought us a free liqueur too. Wonderful experience and would fully recommend it if you are in Nicosia.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"What a fantastic buzzy restaurant. From the guy in blue who usually wears white!!! to all the staff who were so friendly. We were taken by our Cypriot friends on a Wednesday night and it was packed with locals. The food was amazing. The caramelised onions, the chicken platter which was so succulent and the dessert(don't know what it's called but in between panna cotta/ yogurt and then a wonderful digestif. Amazing from start to finish. Thank you",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Sometimes other reviews are a helpful guide to a place. The last 2 I am reading are excellent by one and average by another. Both note the service to be excellent. I have visited the restaurant on many occasions and can confirm that it is one of THE BEST PLACES to eat in Nicosia. This precisely because the food is freshly cooked. The philosophy of the establishment is to serve good food (for which read excellent and enjoyable) at a reasonable price. The portions are generous if you ask for a large chips/fries you will be struggling to finish or you will be sharing them. Always good service and the enthusiasm of the serving staff matches the passion of the kitchen staff. A great formula enjoyably delivered! Ignoring the limitations of the TA review model I have been there with family friends as a couple and on business. It works for all occasions I believe. Certainly visiting guests enthuse and ask to go again. What better testimony. I have been to the restaurant probably a dozen times though, with other travel commitments, haven't been there since March. BUT i will return soon¬¨",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I think there are a number of tell tale signs that tell you when a restaurant is at the top of its game. First, when it is busy before the other operations in the area and there is a steady stream of customers arriving all the time you are there and being found tables. Second, when the staff are working hard and serving efficiently but they are doing it with some style and with a twinkle that suggests working here is good fun. Third, when the chef has the time and confidence to leave the kitchen to talk to customers about their food and their food allergies and is smiling about it all. Fourth, when the staff in the kitchen are very busy but there is an air of organisation and order and knowing your job about the place rather than panic and swearing. Fifth, when the food is freshly cooked, tasty, and a little bit more than you can eat and very reasonably. At this point I am going to ignore the delightful free dessert and the complimentary digestif because they were a bonus. And finally when you leave thinking that was a great experience and I will come back in a day or two when my tummy isn't so full. This place has all of that. Enjoy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,The only reason I see why people go there to eat is that is located in the heart of Nicosia. The food is very average for the prices you get. Probably the most poorly cooked souvlaki you will eat in Cyprus. The service though is excellent.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Relaxed atmosphere, very nice food (simple but tasty). The service was excellent and the waiters were super nice - provided explanations on local starters, desserts and drinks - ""mastika"" (!).",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Good service but the food has not a real character. Nothing special really. It's one of those places you visit only once.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Staff were polite, attentive, helpful. It's a place where you order at the counter and then when it's ready a buzzer rings and you go pick it up. But the staff actually brought it out as it was quite quiet. The prices are incredibly low and yet everything is thoughtfully presented and tasty. If I had stayed longer in Nicosia, I would have returned for sure as would have been nice to try more of the menu.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The staff, the food and the ambience are superb. No wonder this is rated number one on Trip Advisor. I visited one evening with colleagues when I was in the city on business and the food and value for money was so good that the wife and I drove from Protaras three days later so that she could experience it. Don't miss out - I will definitely come again every time I'm in Cyprus.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I had reviewed this place in 2014 (https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190383-d6078892-r212585388-Piatsa_Gourounaki-Nicosia_Nicosia_District.html).3 years later and I'm still loving it! The food quality is the same as when it first opened, the prices are the same and the service is amazing! The staff is friendly, funny, helpful and polite. We went there last week to eat before going out to celebrate a friend's birthday and we had an awesome time! Plus a refreshing dessert on the house and a shot of my favorite masticha liqueur! Great job guys keep it up! No wonder the place is full every night!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food is amazing here quick service excellent value for food friendly people, In the heart of old Nicosia town. You get to see the town for what it really is and not as a tourist attraction. Very homely and very tasty!",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"Whilst I appreciate the fact that the restaurant is trying to modernize souvlakia, the taste is far from authentic, and the chicken is often quite dry.Nonetheless, the location is very good and the place looks good and offers an urban take on the souvlaki restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Visited this restaurant with a few colleagues and had a lovely meal. The staff were very good and helped us make our choices. The menu is not extensive, but had a good selection of traditional dishes and if you like meat this is the place to visit. The portions are extremely generous and price reasonable. As mentioned in other posts, you may get a treat after the meal, which was very enjoyable and added to the experience. Highly recommended if you are in the old town.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Delicious food, superb service and affordable prices. Little treats after the meal for free. Chicken platter is highly recommended",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"My family and i visit piatsa gourounaki tonight. We had to give our name and wait about 20 mins to get a table but that wasn't really a big issue. As soon as we sat down our waiter came over brought the menu and left to bring some water. We decide to order the meat platter for 2, some extra skewers of souvlaki, some dips and a traditional greek salad. The food came really fast, it was hot and very delicious. The chicken souvlaki was very tender and i was very surprised. We drank 3 pint of beers and in the end they brought us desserts on the house. Overall, the food was excellent, the staff very polite and friendly.47 euro for 4 people it's something that you won't find in Nicosia. Definitely a very good choice for our evening.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Thankfully read the reviews on TA and we decided to give it a try.Quaint setting between the 2 main streets of the old city of Nicosia.We had a selection of starters (bad move) save yourselves for the most tender meat platter you've ever had and sooo tasty! Selection of Pork Kebabs, Chicken Kebabs, Veal and leak minced Kebabs perfectly marinated and seasoned. Service was excellent food delivered quickly and a little liquor on the house to finish.

50,One of the best place to enjoy chicken and very friendly staff. Highly recommended place for a dinner and value for a money.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Busy and trendy, this is a fast moving, fast serving whoosh of a restaurant. Lots of helpful staff and a pared down menu is freshly and quickly cooked and delivered. Add to that that it is pretty tasty food as well, and it is easy to see why it was full when we went and most times when we walked past. One tip, order the starters and eat them and then order your main. That may sound obvious if you have been before but for us it meant everything arriving together. Tricky to eat everything hot when it is sitting there, however I can't fault them as the manager had a new wrap delivered to replace a by now warm wrap without any hassle.All of this is contained in a cool looking, spotless but possibly a bit cold and fast foody. Would still advise giving a try and you won't be disappointed.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Incredible choice, prices, taste, service and atmosphere. What else is there to say? Now I'm just filling-up characters.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This place is an absolute must for anyone visiting Nicosia! We shared a meat platter and couldn't manage to finish it no matter how delish it was. It was huge! We were offered free desserts and a digestive spirit by our waiter who was so welcoming and attentive. I couldn't recommend this place enough!,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Quick service and good food! Offers a great variety of meat dishes and traditional greek and Cypriot dishes with a modern twist!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We got there in time as a few minutes later there was people waiting for a table.Great service found it a bit confusing with menu wanted souvlaki they sale by the skewer with only bread. I did ask what it comes with but there was a language problem.Got charge for a big bowl of Greek salad ‚Ç¨6.50 & tzatziki ‚Ç¨1.50 Which I didn't want but no idea it didn't come with souvlaki!So my advice just pay for the platter for two that's all you need ‚Ç¨15 comes with loads seen people ordering it. for us we wanted small meal and end paying ‚Ç¨23 for less.It's a great place, clean, good service and food was great !Worth eating there just take time ordering asking the right questions get what you want.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very professional service, friendly staff, great food, free dessert: what else can you ask for. We went there for lunch and decided to repeat for dinner. Best value for money of our week in Cyprus.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Stumbled across this great restaurant while looking for a place to have lunch. We sat down at an empty restaurant, just as it opened for lunch, but within 5 minutes the place was full - with good reason! We decided to share a meat platter with samples of various local grilled meat dishes, accompanied with oven baked vegetables and chips. We got a huge platter with absolutely delicious food. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and offered us complimentary desert and a shot of local liqueur after the meal. All in all, a very enjoyable experience, and would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good local cuisine, served with a smile.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Good central location in the old town. Popular, so busy but worth a few minutes wait if you go at peak times. Good choice on menu. Two of us shared a chicken platter and there was more than enough food - doggy bags supplied! Food was very tasty and reasonably priced. Staff friendly and helpful. The disgestif offered at the end of the meal on the house may not be to everyone's taste. Worth going if you enjoy grilled meat.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We enjoyed an excellent vegetarian meal on our holidays. There was plenty of choice. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food is exceptionally reasonable and there is a great atmosphere. Highly recommended.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Piatsa Gourounaki is a Greek fast food restaurant in the heart of old Nicosia. You can't book, so either arrive early, choose a quiet time, or be prepared to wait for a table. The place is always busy! We've been several times and always left satisfied.The food is very good - of course, assuming you like Greek/Mediterranean charcoal grill: mainly kebabs. Salads and appetisers are also good. Prices are very reasonable. And service is excellent even when the place is packed (which it usually is).",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Good quality meat, especially their highly-recommended Chicken Souvlaki in Greek Pitta with fries, tzatziki & cucumber!!! The waiters are very polite & helpful, thus providing a very good level of service to the Clients! Try that Chicken Souvlaki and you will remember me! Me, my girl and my bro are satisfied with their food quality & quantity! The main Shopping Street (Ledras Street) is just 3 minutes WALKING from this Restaurant, which counts as another PLUS!",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"This is cheap (15$ drink inc.), this is fast (30'), this is hummm quiet ok about food.Not a restaurant but a cypriot fast food overcrowed in a good location.Not a place for business diner but with friends.Kebab almost not cooked, ask for a longer preparation",Piatsa Gourounaki
10,"The place is very beautifully decorated! The waiters were not as polite as the owner! He saved the matter about this. We ordered a platter for two and extra some pork souvlaki and greek salad. It was too expensive for eating just souvlaki. The food was just fine, nothing wow! The dinner closed by the treat of a cream by the owner. One of the stuff was very hurry to go home and he started wiping the plates at the next table of us and making an annoying noise. Also by the time we were at the place it was winter but either we were sitting inside or outside the cold was the same.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I don't remember exactly the name of the food I have ordered, but we were a group of 7 and almost everybody bought different stuff, and all were amazing! The waiters are kind and funny, the cook walks around the tables to observe how people like the food. Desert and local drink - shot from the house. They make you feel like at home. Excellent service, to go over and over again!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Nice food and good regular prices. Visited both express, and onasagorou restaurant. Long queues but it is worth it, if you are in a hurry try the express shop at the start of lidras.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Cute, cozy and modern suvlaki (traditional greek meet dish) place located at one of the most beautiful squares of Nicosia - Faneromeni - serving delicious food with the good price and service. Recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Amazing experience, despite that the place was filled to the brink with locals we were served at lightning speed and with great kindness and attention to detail. The food was amazing and of superb quality. Price was low, quantity was more than enough to fill our bellies - wonderful. Deservedly the #1 of Nicosia!!A little note : gluten free they do, but I'm not 100% sure if the kitchen is safe for very sensitive individuals. Still they cared a lot about my allergy and were very helpful!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Perfect place to eat grilled meat! Cypriot-Greek cuisine.Very quick service good quality large portions and very good prices! Unfortunately they dont take reservations so you have to wait a little to get a table! Sometimes you have to wait longer than 15 min but the food is really nice! Perfect for a night out with friends or family! Staff very friendly and polite!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"If you go here and sit down you might at first instance wonder what is it that makes this place number 1 in all Nicosia. After all - the menu is not that extraordinary and the place itself - even though it's lively and the service seems great - doesn't strike you as anything super special either. But then you sit down and things start happening. If you're lucky the owner himself wanders up to you and strikes up a conversation. he has some great anecdotes to tell you, some little jokes here and there - something personal... something funny... and immediately you feel drawn to this place. He'll recommend you something but he won't be pushy and the food arrives fast, fresh, piping hot. Again, don't be surprised if they throw in a surprise or two. When I went, the owner told us how he's experimenting with his own chimichurri sauce, so he had added a little bowl of it with our order. Have to say it was excellent too. At the end of the meal they got us some free desserts - also seemed to be a standard practice here. So that's what it is that makes the place great: attention to details. I'd be very surprised if you walked away unhappy.There's another Piatsa Gourounaki recently opened just near the Ledra street, the Express, which, I suppose, is a Cyprus version of a McDonald's - a fast food joint where all your souvlakis, salads, wraps and plates are made to order fast and fresh. Went there too, ten points for fast, friendly service, clean premises and tasty food.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went for lunch with small kids, the food was very tasty, we all enjoyed. All staff are friendly and really customer minded!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We just finished having an incredible meal! The staff are some of the best have encountered in the world, friendly & attentive, they treated our four year old son like he was a member of their family. The food was fantastic and due to a mechanical issue the French fries (chips) were a few minutes delayed and because of this the management provided us desserts on the house as well as a digestive drink. ""Wow"" is the first word I think of after experiencing dinner here. The owner stopped by numerous times to check in with us and at the end of the meal went out of his way to arrange a taxi cab for us. If you are lucky enough to visit Nicosia then this is must for a meal. You will not regret the choice. Thanks to the staff and owner, great experience, we will be back!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Great souvlaki concept restaurant which serves wholesome simple dishes in a lovely clean and friendly setting.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We have just experienced one of, if not the best meal in our 12 years of coming out to Cyprus. We are staying in Nicosia for two nights to take in the atmosphere of the city. We asked the hotel where to go, Piatsa is a good place. Checked on TripAdvisor and it's number 1. I can understand why it's number 1; Service, food, atmosphere and food at a price that won't break the bank. all combine to make it a perfect evening. We had the meat platter preceded by a house salad, bread and olive oil. Awesome pork, chicken, souvlaki, roasted vegetables plus honey mustard, tzatziki, chips and pitta. Wow! We managed to get through 90% but what flavours. When we walked to the restaurant we passed a good number of others listed on TA, all quiet, turn the corner and Piatsa is packed, lively and welcoming. If ever in Nicosia don't go anywhere else. As I said before, it's number 1 for good reason. Well done, excellence takes a lot of hard work to get there and maintain.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Greek cuisine grill and souvlaki. Meat based menu but you can also find a few fresh vegetarian salads.The prices are very attractive and the quality is very good!The staff is very polite and helpful and you are quickly served despite the fact that the place is always extremely busy.We go there once a month and we are always happy!Don't miss it if u would like a quick good meal in logic prices!,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Very good prices, Very good quality, Very good Service!!! Waiters are very friendly. Nice Music. Choose their unique platters for Lunch and dinner.",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"Despite the no-reservations policy of this restaurant you rarely have to wait for more than 10 minutes to get a table. If you are looking to get good quality kebab at very reasonable prices with no cars at sight then this is the place to go, especially in Spring and Autumn where temperatures invite outside sitting.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,First time ever visiting this restaurant. Very tasty food good choice portions a very large. Salads and dips very very tasty. Anyone that's hasn't gone is a must. They have platters with various types o meat well worth it.,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Easy to find, very nice and welcoming stuff - a lot of them knows russian so it made the order easier. Great food! We were 4 adults and ate the couple meal and one of the main meals. Loved this place and totally would recommend!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I was only in Nicosia for two evenings with a work event, one of those evenings was going to be tied up with a social event, and it was suggested that we went here for the other.As soon as we walked in we were warmly welcomed. As three of us waited for the fourth to arrive there was no pressure to order, and when we went to order the waiter suggested, if it was OK, that we leave it all to him.Many platters of food arrived, not many of them all that vegetarian-friendly, and more than enough to fill us up, there may even have been the odd shot of local spirit (not Zivana, and I must admit it might have had a slight smell of 1980s aftershave).The bill at the end was pretty reasonable too.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,This place is always PACKED on weekends So make sure you either go early (12-12:30) or you prepare to wait for a table. But it is definitely worth your time.

50,"With its marvelous mix of genuine Greek cooking, warm hospitality and perfect service, the Piatsa Gourounaki restaurant deserves all the excellent reviews already shown Tripadvisor. The chef and his team not only succeed in combining high quality and very reasonable prices, they also mix flair, humor and professionalism into that rare blend that makes you feel at home. We went for dinner and lunch, both were great experiences!",Piatsa Gourounaki
10,"Well first of all, you can't reserve a table but instead you have to wait outside on the line until you finally find one. I don't know why they prefer not to make their costumers life a little more easy, but maybe it's because they want to look popular (they are). Second of all, while I was studying there I visited this place sometimes. Once I ordered a Ntakos salad and I found a hair in it. I thought it was just an understandable mistake. The next time I went there I ordered a Pita souvlaki and I found....a hair in it too. Well, maybe someone has to be more careful when he/she prepares FOOD for someone else. After your meal you'll have the pleasure to taste a piace of tasty panacota, if you'll still have attention to eat at all.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"It is located in the city center, the food is excellent, the prices are very reasonable. The staff is excellent, we'll go again. The place opens at 12:30 (unlike it is listed on TripAdvisor). Be sure to get there early, because it is really popular.",Piatsa Gourounaki

The staff were pleasant and courteous and the service very prompt.A wide variety of meals was offered. We ordered Kebab Politico with Lamb and Veal, Pork Kebab and Chicken Kebab. All dishes were very well presented, very tasty and very stomach-filling. After the meal we were treated to a Panakota dessert that was on the shop; it was very tasty too.Prices were logical giving very good value-for-money.We recommend Piatsa Gourounaki whole-heartedly and we will certainly call again!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I was in Cyprus for a work trip and I had the occasion to have dinner here thanks by all the positive reviews. I have to say it's all true.

The restaurant serves platters as well with The stuff is very friendly and at the end of each meal the restaurant offers a cake for free or even coffee. The waiting time for sitting is approximately 15 minutes even at weekends. Its a must cheap and delicious Cyprus restaurant to visit.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is a good place to visit for nice good Greek food in charcoal. In the old town of Nicosia, you can enjoy various places around it and you can have a nice walk around the whole erea. Food is great in reasonable price. Due to the fact that is getting very busy, no reservations are made.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went to this restaurant under recommendation. It was full and we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table, but the waiting was absolutely worthy.

40,"Very nice food.The souvlaki pork was very nice.The service is good, although not fast. we waited for the bill more time than the food itself.At the end of the meal, the head waiter gave us a treat of a liquor and it was nice.Waiting period is about 10-15 mins in average. it's a local fast food restaurant so there is nothing special in the place, just a good food during a walk on Ledras street.*** best choice out of other restaurants, mainly because lost of them are a ""tourist traps"" more than a good food places.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,The yitle says it all. Based in the old city of Nicosia at the end of ledras and onasagorou street piatsa gourounaki is always busy because of two things. Excellent service and delicious dishes. What else do you want when going for lunch or dinners. Also great platters to share and very good prices,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,Incredible tastes you can actually taste the spices. Enjoy the kebab and the souvlaki with a selection of dips pitta bread and a cold beer in the heart of the old city by Fanerwmeni Church. You know how good the food is by the long line of cypriots waiting for a free table...,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Piatsa Gourounaki is one of those restaurants that makes you feel really happy: the hospitality is really warm and welcoming; the food plentiful and delicious, and the price so low that you will probably assume something was left off the bill.

50,"The restaurant is in the old Nicosia very easy to find. The waiters are all very friendly, nice and there when you need them. The food is very delicious, I went two times with my friends when I was there in Erasmus and each time was so delicious. We took 2 plateau for 5 with different meats and we enjoyed them, we also took a Greek salad and it was also very good. The price is very low!! less than 10‚Ç¨ by person with everything we took it is really nothing.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I visited Piatsa Gourounaki for lunch with two friends. We got served right away and the staff were very friendly. We ordered two pork souvlaki (merida - whole portion) and chicken thighs and were both served with chips, tzatziki, Greek pitta and tomato. The portions were very big and the damage was only ‚Ç¨6. Non of us even managed to finish their food. Very good quality souvlaki for such a good price. Also on a very good location, right in the centre of the old city. Will be going back for sure.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food was amazing. The meat platters were a lot of food, and both meat platters were delicious. Had some appettizers as well. We were amazed by the good meat quality. Wine was chilled to perfection. Staff was helpful, fast and polite and we also got treated with a free dessert. Its totally worth going and will visit again soon.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Heaven on a plate. Ledras street location can be a bit hectic, so there's a 'fast' option few hundred meters from Eleftheria Square. Whatever you order, you won't go wrong. Or hungry. And it won't break the bank.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,I loved the big meat platters and the fast service. All at very reasonable prices. Few steps away from a very beautiful Cathedral in the old town of Nicosia. The restaurant is small but there are seats outside front road and side place. Since it is located in the old town of Nicosia only pedestrians are moving in the area. this makes it even more comfortable for families with young children to visit and feel safe for their kids to run around.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Food was as always amazing, staff are very friendly. Lovely atmosphere and great prices. Very definately worth a visit!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Was at the new place close to the main. Us station for lunch. Their prices are good, location as well. Nice interior. They played jazz and Greek music.Food is mainly grilled meat and pitas. We also got a ""waiting pita"" with tzatsiki. After our meal we got a complementary nice tasting small pudding.When I wanted something extra (a salad and another pita) they were very quick about it. Paid up front and they didn't seem to try to get extra tips and such. Very nice.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very nice place, clever decoration, great food, fulfilling servings. The juiciest souvlaki I've ever eaten! Once the central square is finished, it will have great view too.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you think of a Cypriot version of McDonalds serving Kebabs you will not go far wrong. This however is much more than the Kebab places you will see in the UK. It is very large, spotlessly clean with very attentive and pleasant staff. You order at the counter and your food is cooked to order. You go and sit down after ordering and they give you a gadget that vigorously vibrates when your food is ready to collect from the counter. They serve a wide range of drinks including beer. All staff speak excellent English. The food is plentiful and represents excellent value for money. It was relatively quiet at lunchtime in early December but I understand there is a queue for tables in the evenings as they do not take bookings. What they do, they do extremely well but they will need to consider a more international catchy name if they are to appeal to the non-Greek speaking clientele.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We were curious and went on a Saturday evening. We had to wait for a table but it was worth the wait. Great food, and great prices. Fresh & tasty, copious amounts, nice waiters, going the extra mile and keeping you happy checking regularly. Good wine and beer, small prices. Dessert on the house. Amazing experience!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Came here with 16/17 friends and we were put on 3 separate tables for obvious reasons , the food was second to none and the service was great they were friendly and helpful and didn't rush us , it was surprisingly affordable and I will most defiantly be coming back",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We had a very good dinner here. It is good food and good service, well worth the money. You will get a very nice meal in a nice atmosphere. The meny is short but good but the wine menu is shorter, the house wine is OK. Not suitable for business meeeings but very good for families and friends.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The service is very excellent, friendly also the food is amazing. We try the chicken plate. Maybe the eggplant and pumpkin shouldn't have so much oil by it's ok! The chicken fillet is extraordinary! We try cheese salad and eggplant salad was very good! Highly recommend!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food was delicious! I am very pleased with everything. The decoration is very nice, stuff work hard and smile a lot!More specifically, we went 4 people and we ordered 2 chicken platters and different sauces. We really appreciated the good taste of the chicken and the warmth stuff made us feel. We will visit this place again. I cannot make even one negative comment for this place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The restaurant was in a different place but the rating is well deserved!!!The plate entitled meat for one is enough for TWO! The mustard and honey sauce is from heaven, the chips are on point and meat is full of flavour!Loved the staff also :) the manager came to our table asking for our input... So nice :)Totally recomend! Would visit again...",Piatsa Gourounaki
10,I visit only one time that place and i will never go agan !!! The servise was bad and not profesional and the food was really bad,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"very taste and delicious food, very beautiful decoration with greek atmosphere! it was amazing. Its a family place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This was our second visit to Piatsa Gourounaki and was every bit as good as the first. We opted for the chicken platter, which was beautiful, served with roasted veg and fries. We had caramelised onion as a side dish which is to die for. Staff were so friendly and attentive. After our main course we were offered a dessert of mahalepi and a liquer on the house, all for the most amazing price of ‚Ç¨15.50 for two of us, such great value. Can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. You can't book, they open for dinner at 7pm so get along early as it gets very busy especially at weekends.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Delicious chicken and pork dishes. Service is excellent, have eaten there many tiem and have been given free dessert! Great place for every one to go to.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Great atmosphere, good plates. I sugest chicken meat plater.!!! Also the honey cheese for starter its a great choise",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Probably the only 'flaw' of the restaurant is that they don't take reservations and almost every night there is a busy night, therefore I would definitely recommend coming for an early dinner. The food is fantastic and so is the service. Despite busy hours we never had to wait for food for over 30 minutes and the quality is always at its best.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"All the locals eat here, the traditional food is sooooo good and such great value for money. I always get a complimentary desert and a shot!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"we've eaten here 4 times now, and will certainly go back. Last night 3 of us shared the chicken legs, greek salad, olives, tahini, a hot cheese pie [recommended by the waiter, quite rightly] and one other, can't remember, and it was plenty. Don't over order, you can always add something. Free pud was the rosewater blancmange, glad to have tried it but don't want it again. Large slug of mastic to round things off [on the house] Very helpful waiters every time, and they recognise us which is nice. Extensive menu down which we are eating. Outdoor seating which I like [and indoor] Loos are fine. Prices are excellent.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great food and a great place. Very good service however you need to wait to be seated in peak hours. Relatively worth it,Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"I have been here a couple of times.

50,I visit this restaurant twice a week. The food is great. The service is outstanding. The prices are very fair. The decoration is very nice and in general this is a casual honest restaurant with greek and Cypriot cuisine.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We have eaten in this restaurant numerous times and each time we can't fault the food or service.On this occasion we were group of 4 adults & 3 children.There is very good choice on the menu & the food is always so tasty & fresh and the portion sizes are quite big! Meat platters and veggie platters cannot be beaten!!The staff are very friendly & very helpful too and there is never an issue getting something separate from the menu for kiddies!There is always a complimentary liquor shot & local sweet brought after the meal!The menu is so reasonably priced for the quantity & quality of food you receive. It is a very busy place but it never seems to effect the quality of the service! Opens in evening at 7pm so we normally get there at 7pm sharp to get seat without waiting as no reservations! The restaurant itself is very tastefully decorated with a very modern edge to it. It's a lovely place to dine with plenty of atmosphere in it.Can't recommend this place more for something delicious to eat!,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"We visited Piatsa Gourounaki last night. We were impressed of how fast the service was. After an appetizer which is on the house, we were served our order within 10 minutes max. We ordered a meat platter for two and a salad. The meat was well grilled, although I would prefer the souvlacki to be more juicy. The service was fast but also easy going and professional at the same time. Overall we enjoyed our experience.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"At the time of my trip to Nicosia, Piatsa Gourounaki was ranked n¬∞1 on Trip Advisor restaurant list of this town and I was curious to try the traveler's favorite. Located in the heart of the old town, it's surely a place addressed to the foreign people who visit the capital of Cyprus, it has a typical menu and small tables outside as many other restaurants of the same area. Besides that, food and service were very good, it's definitely not a tourist trap. One of their specialties is the souvlaki, I ordered a chicken one wrapped in pita bread filled with tomatoes, fried potatoes and tzatziki sauce. It was delicious! The service was also at the top, before my souvlaki they brought me a small appetizer and at the end they offered me a dessert, the waiter was very nice and attentive. Interiors and tables outside are new and modern, it only lacks a bit of the authentic atmosphere of the town. The prices were also extremely good, considering everything, above all the quality of food and preparation.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"No reservations though, but a great place in Nicosia with reasonable prices Good food served quick Pleasant staff!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,This is by far my most favorite Greek food place to have lunch or dinner. Great options for vegetarians and great prices!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"No reservations are taken. First come, first served so at popular times you may have to wait. The food itself is good and typically Cypriot style and it is reasonably priced. Friendly and efficient staff.So why not 5 stars? The food was good but there was no ""wow"" factor.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great quality, fast service, reasonable prices. No reservations though, but a great place in the center of the old town of Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,"The restaurant is realy good. The food is nice, a lit of people and a cozy feeling. I actually do not have anything negative about the food nit to mention thry also gave me and my friend free desert. That was a really good service towards customers. The souvlaki pork and chicken was delicious as well as there grilled pitta. My only concern is that it is always full and they should open a new restaurant and somewhere else not at ledras for more convenience. Overall an excellent redtaurant and people who read my review should go.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We went here on a Sunday night when it opens at 6.30pm. We arrived at 6.50pm and had to wait 10 minutes for a table as it was already full. It was worth the wait.

Food was good - too much to finish - and total bill for three was 33 euros - great value!",Piatsa Gourounaki

30,I don't know what all the rave and wait is about at this place. The food is OK. Nothing wow. There are much better places to eat in Nicosia. It's also very busy so you will have to wait for a table.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Really good food, good service, crowded. It s always full but you get to seat after a few minutes. Very good tavern style food and good service. Value for money",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Poor quality of meat, nicely wrapped, friendly stuff and always busy. I am still wondering why people make lines to find a table for a souvlaki that doesn't taste like one.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"As residents of Cyprus, this is where we take visiting friends and family. Both modern and traditional at the same time, this restaurant is a great deal. Staff is incredibly friendly, food is great and location is ideal. The restaurant is very modern (disabled access, clean bathrooms). Stick around for complimentary desserts and masticha liqueur at the end!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Perfect food, marinated meal on charcoal (we took chicken plate for two) and side dishes, really great home wine, very good service. You'll have to wait for the table, when you'll come 1915 or later.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Can't fault this place. Location is excellent right on the pedestrian runway perfect for people watching, there's live music at the corner restaurant near by, service is good, and the food is great and inexpensive. The only thing is that you'll have to wait for a table - it's extremely popular.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This was my first visit to Nicosia and first dinner and what a choice this was. If you are only moderately hungry - look for another restaurant. You will leave this restaurant satiated, satisfied and waiting for days to get a table again. The fare is simple yet plentiful with a spectacular selection of grilled meats and vegetables. End you meal with a shot of Mastika, a subtle liqueur from Chios. There are always large crowds waiting for an outdoor table, so arrive earlier just before the locals begin to eat at 21:00.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,just popped in for some pre dinner snacks had some interesting and flavorsome dips and a beer and wine for my partner,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We were here in our 1 night stay in Nicosia brought by our friend and the food was amazing , also the athmosphere. I would totally recommend this !",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went here after searching for a nice place to eat. Friendly service, great portions, and tasty food. Will come back again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Food fresh and very delicious. Staff is very friendly and helps you find a good choice! Price totally fine. Will stay again mext time i come to Nicosia! :-),Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Have eaten there plenty of times and each time the food has been delicious. This is a very vibey energetic restaurant. Often there is a queue of people trying to get in. So try to make a booking if you can!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Great food, good combinations, nice price, fine service! A great place to have lunch or dinner! Very good chef! Clean and neat!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,My partner rated this restaurant as perhaps 'the best meal ever'. We ordered the mixed meat platter. It was great and very reasonably priced in comparison to other places we have eaten on this trip. Service is also fantastic and the food arrived very quickly. We liked this restaurant so much that we visited twice during our holiday. It is a very popular restaurant and all the tables were full both times we visited and there was a queue to get a table. We had no problem with a short wait.,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,Not nice food but good prices. It worths only if you are starving. For those prices its always full and you need reservation.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"A frequented place by my family and friends, I regularly have a meal at this very Greek oriented kitchen. No airs or frills, very decent food at low affordable prices. Although the downside is that one has to wait for a table, but never over 10 or 15 minutes, which proves how tasty/affordable the place is. Convenient for a quick meal if you want to continue on somewhere else. A bit lacking in the alcohol menu, but not something that would put a dent on the evening.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,People working here are very polite even though most of the days is packed and the work load is heavy. The food taste very nice and the time they need to prepare is pretty short. Even though i am from Nicosia I dont visit the place really often since is always full and i cannot wait that long line to eat.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"OOOOh lovely. Good, wholesome, value for money Cypriot food. Kali Orexi. Bon a petite. It was a very good experience for all the family",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Food is delicious, portions are very generous. Staff is helpful and polite. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recomended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very friendly staff, food is always tasty, fresh and fast, great prices, must visit! It's usually busy so be there 15 mins before you get really hungry and the guys working there will find you a table as soon as they can, very helpful always.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I have been visiting this restaurant fairly often as it offers perhaps the best value for money in Nicosia. The service is excellent and although no reservations can be made the system they use for sitting is fair and efficient. The only comment I will make is about the name as ""gourounaki"" in Greek means pork. For visitors who may not eat pork I can say that the most delicious dishes are lamb and chicken. So the place caters for all tastes in meat eaters. The quantities are large to huge and that is why most customers leave with a take away bag after they settled their bill. In short an excellent choice for tasty meat dishes and hungry eaters.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Friendly and tentative staff , excellent service! We had the meat platter for two which was very tasty and in reality was for three..the greek salad was nice with fresh vegetables..music was entertaining. .will definitely visit !",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Definitely recommended! Plain food but of good quality cooked to perfection tastes really good! Additional bonus, staff manners will make you feel real important, very attentive will address immediately all your needs.... Prices on the low side for the quality offered. Will visit again for sure!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Excellent service and prices Pleasant place Food is simple yet delicious Always a pleasure to visit Highly recommended,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Value for money and tasteful food. No reservations you may have to wait for a bit but it is totally worth it,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Excellent food, very decent prices. Service is very efficient, and place is always packed with people. Lovely atmosphere and dishes served promptly.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Had dinner with group of 6, we ordered a couple of the platters and some extra dishes. Portions are generous, with the platters being exceptional value for money. Service was quick and attentive. Food is tasty and fresh. The only negative is the hectic atmosphere and how crowded the place is. In my opinion they have crammed too many tables into the space. It also made the space too warm, even with the air-con on. However overall a very enjoyable meal!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went here on the Saturday night. It was very busy but food came quickly after we sat.I would say this place is comparable to a burger restaurant. You get fries, minced meat, and some baked vegetables. One would say the menaced meat is juicy but other might say greasy.We enjoyed a lot.It is very busy place this the tables get quick turnover.Highly recommend if you are looking for quick, informal and good price dinner in the old town.And don't miss out you get free desert and digestive ;)We took the meat set for two.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I have visited piazza goirounaki several times and each time is unique. The service is amazing and really quick. The food is excellent, the waiters are really polite. The price of the food is cheap for the best quallity that the place offers. You should visit this place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"A party of four of us visited recently after one of our group had eaten here before and highly recommended it. On arrival, there was a great buzz about the place and we were able to get a table immediately. We had a delicious meat meze meal and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our visit! This restaurant definitely deserves its excellent Tripadvisor rating!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Good food, good price, high popularity and very fast service. And one more detail - queue every night. Min 15 minutes to wait.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"The thing that annoys me most in Cyprus is 'reservations'. Cypriots don't like to have to wait or cue for anything so restaurants, pubs, clubs, etc all have a system of 'reservations'. As Cypriots usually dine out at around 9pm, if you go at 7.30pm, you will see a restaurant full of empty tables, but they will NOT offer you a table!Fortunately, Piatsa Gourounaki have decided to enter the 21st century and do not accept reservations. This docent mean that Cypriots have decided to boycott them as a result... paradoxically there is always a cue outside waiting to be seated.We've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated by the reliable maitre de with his clipboard outside.The waiting staff are very good, and the service is usually prompt. The food selection is a little limited, which I guess is the payoff for the quick service and fast customer turnaround. The food quality and presentation is usually very good, and consists of greek-inspired meze style selections of individual plates... although, you can also order a 'plate' of your own food if you wish.The price is very reasonable considering the whole experience.In summary, I think the guaranteed seating (albeit with a possible wait time), the service, the quality and the cost make this place an excellent choice of a relaxed meal with you partner, family or colleagues alike.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We were recommended this restaurant by two independent people at the client site. After walking past many empty or sparkly populated eateries (admittedly it was fairly early) we finally arrived here to find it heaving.The food is very good, but I honestly don't think that's the appeal. It's the staff that win it over. The owner/chef Charis made his way round tables personally greeting guests, and spent some time without ensuring we were being properly looked after.Indeed, all of the staff were just as attentive, bringing the food promptly, and being available for drinks and the bill.Lovely location for people-watching too.Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Piatsa Gourounaki is one of the most hyped places in Nicosia, with good reason. It offers a good variety of Greek fare (think kebab, pork/chicken souvlaki, yummy appetizers, and more), in a buzzing atmosphere (a bit too noisy for my taste, as tables are too close to each other), and very fast (if not too fast). The service is good in the sense that it is very attentive, almost too attentive, and considering the lines of people waiting outside, you feel like you have to eat fast and turn the table over to them. That's my only beef with the restaurant. On the plus side, they sometimes offer dessert in the end, which is a bargain considering its affordable prices and should be applauded.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"Heard a lot about this place so decided to visit one evening with my partner. We ordered a tomato basil salad , potatoes and a yiaourtlou kebab.The salad had a trace of basil not fresh the olive oil in the salad had a stale taste that left a burning feeling in my throat. The yiaourtlou was more of a tomato sauce that a yogurt sauce with a small sample of yogurt (like a teaspoon full in a lake of tomato paste). Otherwise the kebab were cooked ok.Not impressed ! The waiter was polite though.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Good food at a reasonable price! Especially the meze for two! Loved their serving method! Only thing I did not like, they do not do reservations so you're probably gonna have to wait in line.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I have searched this restaurant in TripAdvosor and it was great! First of all, the nicest service in all Nicosia, and maybe all Cyprus. The meal was delicous and really reasonable price. We have ordered very nice dry vine 50cl for 6‚Ç¨ even in Poland when I came from it's more expensive! I highly recomended this place, cool with nice Mediterranean atmosphere!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Delicious food and excellent service from a very friendly and knowledgable waiter which made our choice of food easy.Lots of people were ordering the sharing platters which looked amazing, but we decided to order individual dishes as I don't eat any meat other than chicken. My husband had a mix of the different meats which was served with bread and chips.... the meat was lovely and the chops were delicious. I had the chicken drumstick dish which was actually chicken thighs off the bone and they were amazing. At the end of the meal you get a complimentary dessert and drink which is a nice touch.We were pleasantly surprised at how cheap the bill was.... a nice ending to a fab meal. Would highly recommend this restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Recommend & booked for us by Hilton Park staff. Just fantastic! Meat platter Greek salad wine desserts & comp liqueur 30 Euros. Such friendly staff. First place we'll go when back in Cyprus.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Best souvlaki, best service, best quality, best prices what I have to say more piatsa gourounaki made my day. :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Definitely deserves it's top rating.Tucked away down a lane from a nice square Piatsa is a great find. For our meat lover there were too many options in the bbq selection but with the price was able to order a bit of anything and everything. As a vegetarian there was a lot of selection and much of it just ‚Ç¨1. They made up a special platter for us which was delicious and were so accommodating of our allergies. We really appreciated the extra service including the desert and aperitif on the house.Highly recommend!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Int the hard of Nicosias old town near Faneromeni church, piatsa gourounaki offers delicious souvlaki in pita with tzatziki, sausages in pita, greek salads potatos etc, so yumme you would like to return. No reservations made so go early to secure a place in delight !!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Simply amazing food, excellent service and professional. The best meal we had in Nicosia and kept going back to it the whole week. Very reasonably priced for the quality we got. Our compliments to the owner who was also super friendly.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very nice place where to eat. AMAZING FOOD :) we had meat meze for two, it was SO Good!!!! You can try different meet souvalky, and there is plenty food for two. Staff and service was excellent. Location can't wish better. Atmosphere brilliant. It's definitely place Nr. 1",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,While Visiting My Birthplace Cyprus. We ate at Piatsa Gourounaki on a number of occasions...Very popular with the locals but Worth the visit...All our meals were cooked to perfection and quite large portions. Very helpful staff and very eager to serve and ensure you enjoy the experience..,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I was there twice. The weather was very good (as usual) so I sat on a table outside. People passing by was an interesting view!I did like everything I had but the second night I wanted to eat light so I ordered what stroke me most the first time: Pitta with chaloumi cheese and tomato and Kebab with yougurt (giaourtlou) that was served with a few slices of aubergines which is a very good idea.Will go again when in Nicosia.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Visited with my daughter on a Sunday for lunch. We chose the chicken platter for two and although the restaurant was buzzing with people, our meal arrived within just a few minutes. It was excellent, traditional Greek bbq style food - masses of skewer cooked tender chicken, grilled vegetables, pitta bread and chips. Enough for three people! And my beer was definitely served in a glass, not plastic. The waiter couldn't have been more helpful, even rebooting their router when I couldn't connect to their wifi. Definitely recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Visited as a group of family of 4 kids and 4 adults. Everyone was happy they could find something they liked! Service was very good, and place was spotless clean and nicely decorated - had just opened up! Truly enjoyable experience for all. The only thing I would change would be to offer drinks, at least beers in real glasses, not plastic.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Buzzing atmosphere, maybe too noisy on this Sunday lunch. Food very good and service excellent. Serves Greek dishes rather than Cypriot but very popular with Cypriots of all ages.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This restaurant really is the true concept of value for money restaurant. Except, the food is by far better than average. Really tasty food! Greek flavours with perfect salads, platters so you can share and always a nice dessert! Reservations are not possible so sometimes you wait for a table but trust me it's worth to wait!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Good food, excellent service in a good llocation.Does not accept reservations which is negative in my opinion.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Piatsa Gourounaki is a nice place to go and eat souvlaki but it is not the best in town. I guess the location it's a plus (located in the old city of Nicosia), and their portions are good. The service is also good. Too bad they do not serve good wine though! If you want to drink wine there, i recommend that is best to order retsina instead.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Overall the food is nice. However trying to get in can become a hustle, as due to long queue and no reservation policy you may stand outside for quite some time. This becomes inconvenient in cold periods (winter time).",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"The souvlaki (and meat in general) is nice; delicious, tasty, and well marinated. Highly recommended for limited budget! Been there a few times. During weekends it is crowded.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I visited this beautiful outdoor tavern in old Nicosia area next to Phaneromeni church and Bank of Cyprus Cultural Centre. Fascinating dishes very reasonable priced. Tip:Go before 8 pm because later it is crowded and will have to wait to be seated.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is a good, fast restaurant with good service and polite people! I have been there many times and was always happy with quality of food and service!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We ordered to share and it was more than enough and so tasty!! The souvlaki was juicy. There is also great selection for vegetarians.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Nice restaurant locaded in the old town of Nicosia. Good quality of food (kebab) at low prices. The only negative is that does not accept reservations and you have to wait in the queu.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,You have to try at all costs chicken there it's unbelievable. Staff is excellent and very helpful besides the fact that it is always busy there. Food is excellent and is really cheap. The portion is satisfying.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food, helpful stuff, nice environment, better with no reservation and on first come first sit method. Worth visiting",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Good resturant good food well grilled souvlaki friendly personel.but since this resturant doesnt work with reservation you have to wait in the line to get a table and this couses presure to the customers to eat as soon as posible and leave since the personel are friquently asking if you have finished your meal.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"a restaurant in a popular pedestrian street. the restaurant does not accept reservations and the service is good and fast with good quality and tasting food, mainly barbecued. sweet and well cooked fries at good prices. a good selection of beers and other alcoholic beverages.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Good cheap perfect environment. The personnel is very friendly. The restaurant is located in the old town.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very good quality and low prices. However, always congested and no reservations are made. This is the only drawback as one has to wait in the queu",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The best grilled souvlaki and lamb chops in Cyprus. Very good atmosphere relaxing place and very good value for money . The staff and the Management very helpful and professional.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Many people would consider Cyprus a culinary extension of Greece. In many aspects it is, but this place offers the kind of food you would get in busy Athenian backstreets. Speciality on meat dishes. The value is good, but a little bit too busy and that has a reverse effect on ambiance and service.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,A good value for money restaurant with good local ( Cypriot and Greek food) after seating fast service ( sometimes long waiting time for seating ) recommended hours 7.30-8.30,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Good / Fast Service while the staff is always friendly and the food is well cooked and fresh. Prices are fair,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Service is so quick that you feel you have to finish dinner and go.... otherwise is a decent restaurant and quite cheap,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The cook and staff were super friendly and recommended a platter for us that was soooo tasty! Definitely recommended,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Supposedly, it is a self service place, which you find out once you sit down. I failed to see the logic behind the whole idea as there are waiters in the place just hanging around while you have to go down to the cashier to order and then back to your table and wait for the buzzer to go off. The food was ok. However i find it simply inconvenient. Plus, the menu is not the same as at the other restaurant at Faneromeni. The salads are individual size now and you end up paying more, for no service, while, I repeat, you see the waiters just hanging around.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is a must visit place when you want nice food at low cost!! We love the ""mpoutakia kotopoullou"" as well as their souvlaki! Be prepared to wait for 10-15 minutes if you go after 9 o clock as is always busy and doen't make reservations! But some things are woth of waiting!! Will definitely visit is again!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"We liked the place as we walked down Ledras, so we decided to taste it. We ordered platter for two. Poor quantity, too oily, not good meat. Never again. Also too crowded, only its location is good",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The place is obviously known for meat and barbecues, but we had appetizere and salads and we couldn't be happier! Highly recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very fast service, decent prices, very nice food but you will probably have to wait for a few minutes to get a table as it is an extremely popular place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,The grilled meat served at this restaurant is above average but the wait can be terrible because they do not take reservations. It's located in the old city which gives you access to leisurely strolls before and after dinner or if you're in search of a cocktail or after-dinner bar scene. Beware of the possible wait and make plans accordingly.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Located in the old town of Nicosia. Serving a tasty Cypriot food such as souvlaki, salads, etc...good service and friendly waiters. quality/price very reasonable. I like this place and I visit it often. For infos: New location will be opened soon at the upper road of Lidra street near ""La croissanterie"".",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,The food is very good and the service too. The fact that the place is not huge makes the service even better. However it's usually very crowded and you may find yourself unlucky to find a table. There is no reservations option offered. This is both good and bad at the same time. I guess you should get to know the peak hours and avoid them. Be aware that it remains closed curtain hours during the day. The prices are really cheap compared to the quality of the food. Expect a range of popular greek dishes. You can't go wrong with the Giaourtlou kebab!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Went here with family tonight. We were welcomed in and we were very priveliged to have the owner serve us. He recommended dishes so we would have enough food for the four of us. The food was amazing, we had a chicken platter and some sides. (Potato chips, salad, cheese and sun dried tomorrow dip and Caramelised onions) We got complimentary deserts. The service was also amazing. My 9 year old son even enjoyed everything we had. Couldn't believe how little the bill was. Will Definitely be back again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We didn't have much choices to eat lunch on a Sunday and we decided to give it a try. The food was delicious, the staff friendly and helpful and we ate 3 people for 20 euros. Couldn't ask for a better place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Visiting on a Saturday evening we had to wait a while for a table but it was worth the wait - the portions were large and tasty and for a reasonable price in the centre of Nicosia. Outdoor seating was very pleasant in the summer heat.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Not the best food but more than decent and the service, price and setting make it five star. Very efficient and professional restaurant. Don't come expecting amazing food. Simple tasty dishes done very well.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The place is packed while other restaurants nearby are sparsely filled, which means its popular. Almost impossible to get a table and not wait, as the restaurant does not accept reservations. Classic Greek eatery with quick, efficient service. We recently went there with a party of 11 and the host went out of his way to dissuade us from eating. We insisted and he tried to accommodate us the best he could, seating us at two tables. Less than a week later we arrived as they opened at 7 and got a prime spot. For large parties the restaurant should consider accepting reservations, as this is the kind of establishment that is perfect for large families. The nicest touch is the complementary snack at the beginning and the dessert at the end.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Visited the place on a Friday afternoon. Relatively long waiting list but we got a table quickly.The staff are amazing and very helpful. (George)Food is brilliant and very very tasty. We got a desert for free in the end.Prices are value for money.Overall don't think twice to pay a visit.Recommended,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I believe this is one of the best places in old Nicosia and is certainly worth a visit. The place is popular with locals and the prices are reasonable. The service is fast and the music is good. You cannot book a table and during lunch/dinner time you might have to wait for a table. They open for lunch at 12:30 and are usually full by 13:00.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I visit this restaurant 1-2 times per month. I always order chicken meat platter. The service is fast, the personnel is kind and the food is excellent. As for the money, the cost is very reasonable. The bad thing is that you cannot book a table and you always have to wait a couple of minutes as it is always busy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Unfortunately when it comes to food, we all have a different standard for rating it. I see many people rate this place highly because food tastes good and is value for money. Yes it is.On the other hand, almost every piece of meat soaked in oil and salt would taste good. And that's what this place is about. Meat quality is average to poor.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I visit this restaurant for dinner with friends.we order meat platter was very tasteful.the service was great and fust.for sure i will come back.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Visited on a Monday night with a friend! The staff including the chef were very friendly and helpful. Food was served quickly and the portions were very good!! We ordered the Greek salad (small portion), halumi Cheese with tomato in Cypriot pita bread and a giaourtlou with chicken kebab ( normal portion) ( there were grilled veggies-Aubergine, zucchini , green and yellow capsicums and hand cut potatoes with the skin) with house wine and we were so full at the end!!Sorry no room for dessert!!!The concept is clean GREEK souvlaki and all the rest!Note the big blackboard inside on the trivia note- how the souvlaki came to be!!!!They are opening a second store - good luck - we'll be back!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Its worth the wait if you have to que up maybe for 10-20mins on a busy night. The food is really tasty, with portions as big or small as you want. The meat platter for two is more than enough, very filling at 20euros. Quick and simple, friendly service anytime of the day place. The Chief Executive Chef Harris came to the table to check everything was ok and helped us with our order which impressed me also, they care about there food and service. Love it, would definitely go again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great value for money. The chicken platter was excellent, the kids loved it including the greek salad. The stuff is most friendly and service is fast. Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Best chicken I ever had. Informal restaurant, nice place, lots of cats. Waiters are quick and kind, I went there three times and I hope to come again. Definitely a place where to have a nice dinner downtown.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went to Nicosia to have fun and dine. Just by chance, we came across this place and immediately felt in love with it because of the ambience that surrounds this place. Despite, that this is in the heart of old town of Nicosia, which is usually considered to be very touristic and boring, it holds modern and stylish way to make you feel good. Cheers!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"whilst some might be put of by the 'chain' element of Piatsa Gourounaki, it felt and looked authentic Greek Cypriot. A really good, buzzy atmosphere and excellent food at really good prices, provided a great meal. Staff were friendly on both occasions we visited.Highly recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"A must ""sit and eat"" if you are in old town Nicosia and feeling hungry. Excellent Greek food in terms of both quality and quantity, at very reasonable prices.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Piatsa Gourounaki is an outstanding restaurant in Nicosia. It has delicious food in quite fair prices , a number of platters and a variety of meat. I will totally recommend it if you want to eat meat :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I go to this restaurant 2-3 times a month and it never disappoints. Good food at reasonable prices with the service to much. Highly recommended if you want to eat and are on a budget,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The food here is so nice and more than fairly priced. Even though the place is busy the staff is friendly and energetic. Only suggestion is to have more wines to choose from. Highly recommended!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Its a fast served kebab house getting very busy. Fast service and good mouthwatering kebab especially the chicken and lamb kebab (souvlaki). Big portions good prices and fast service making one of the best and busiest place in old nicosia city.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Visited with seven friends and had a vegetarian platter as starter and three meat platters afterwards.All freshly cooked, tasting of the barbecue and disappeared so quickly that I didn't get a picture!Offered free liqueurs and desserts for no reason at all (milk pudding and a variation on Ouzo)Seated outside beside the restaurant in an blind alley with a cooling breeze: excellent end to first day in roasting Nicosia",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Whilst looking for a place to eat this place looked busy so decided to give it a go. We are a family of 6 and so had one each of the chicken, meat and vegetable platters. Service was quick and friendly and the food was absolutely outstanding. Even my very picky young sons enjoyed the food. Just a shame there aren't any more of these restaurants around Cyprus.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,It's location is very good. You can go on foot. The service is very good along with the food. You should definitely try it.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Nice atmosphere, good food for the whole family. The service was not great probably because they are very busy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Hard to find a table but very good food. Inside the smell is not so comfortable and out side is much more nicer.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Ate there a month ago with a big group of friends for lunch. Must go early in order to find a table since the place is always packed. No reservations are made. Mainly serves greek cusine on barbeque eg. gyros, chicken kebab, pork kebab etc. The portions are big with potatoes tomato and sauce and are freshly made. The prices normal to expensive but worth it. The service was excellent. Free homemade cake and mastixa liquer at the end of our meal. Would definately be back again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If you get to find a table... you 'll have the best time ever... Service: check, Food: omg check, Prices: check... What more can I say.... Try the ""poikilia""!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,In ledras area in nicosia great service with good quantities of grilled good! Very good prices!They dont accept reservation so you have to wait 5-10min to sit on a table.Friendly people,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Nice food, value for money, nice environment, no bookings thus waiting to be seated required, try their starters",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Good tavern, great service, not much variety but a nice place to have some meat dishes cooked on charcoal.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Kept hearing about the place for a while about many people and I had to try it to see what everyone is about, and indeed the it lives up to every good words that was said about the place.Great location downtown, staff amazing and friendly, food finger licking, and prices are very affordable.Highly recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki

Efficient, attentive, friendly and most polite.Thank you for looking after us and for being so pleasant.Congratulations to the HR department and Management for the staff selection.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Overall a good place to eat. You need to reserve. Overcrowded. Reasonable prices and nice cold beers. Platters is the best choice.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great; thanks to trip advisor I was prepared to look for this restaurant and i made the right choice. The place is very welcome and the staff are excellent. The price is worth for the delicious food.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Had dinner as couple on Jul. 13 , table 16 : we took taxi from hotel and were dropped off at nearest street approx. 100 m. from restaurant . While most other restaurants were empty this place was already going full blast at 07:30 pm ! Luckily there was a few tables for 2 left inside when we arrived at 07:30 pm ; most tables are 4 or more and were already occupied with mostly locals enjoying local beers and heaps of meat and fries :))Got a bottle of water before really sitting down and english menus presented by multi- lingual waitress. Menu is very straightforward and centered around grilled meat( pork/chicken / lamb ) in different variations and flavours. We took a mezze with smoked eggplant and pitta bread.Entree for both was grilled lamb skewers which were grilled to perfection !!We asked to drop the fries - included in the meal-so we got grilled veggies instead .This was a big portion of grilled eggplant/squash and peppers . Under the meat and veggies was a large pitta bread soaking the meat juices which serves as extra support while eating meat . After clearing the table we got offered a dessert on the house which we declined as we were already very satisfied , we also declined offered mastika on the house to big surprise of waiter...The total bill came to about 30 euro (incl.10% tipped extra )Service was swift , very friendly and very attentive so this is a restaurant IMHO more than worth the taxi trip from outside the old town . We paid about 20 euro round trip on our taxi fare from Hilton Park Nicosia .Leaving the restaurant at 08:15 pm there were about 25 people waiting to be seated. BTW on arrival and if there is a wait , look out for a big man with a clipboard , he's the one taking names and numbers and he will call you when a tablle free's up inside or out .This restaurant does NOT take reservations and opens at 07:00 pm so do come early or be prepared for a wait while you enjoy a drink standing in the street and enjoying the scenery around you :))",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Friendly environment, very good service, delicious food ! Definitely recommended for casual dinner in the heart of Nicosia!",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"This is a great place for a casual meal at competitive prices. As the name suggests loosely translated ""baby pig square"" its all about souvlaki and charcoal grilled meats.Service can be slow at peak times and you may have to wait for a table so make a reservation.Cold beer is a good idea and most of the seating space is outside so on warm night don't overdress",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Whenever i am in town - Ledras/Onasagorou i find myself enjoying the Piatsa Gourounaki becuase its a clean meal, well cooked and fast excellent service.Keep up the good work! :-)I would love to see some additions to the menu... such as turkey breast and chicken breast fillet grilled as well as a bigger variety of green salads.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The food was just delicious! Platters for 2 are just 12-15‚Ç¨ which makes an 20‚Ç¨ meal for 2 ! An amazing value for 2! Just amazing! Highly recomended,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,bravo well done fantastic place i really recomand this place sure i will come back next time i will be here .. highly recomanded,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The waiters are very friendly and helpful. Delicious food and a very good place to have a lunch or just rest a little. They even gave us a dessert on the house!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Wow! End of the meal, while we are planning to leave and I was considering to come back home and write down some good words for this lovely place, suddenly the head waiter comes and start chatting with us, very friendly and social but not disturbing, asks if we enjoy the food and if we want to try something sweet or may be a local liquor. While a was showing no interest for additional orders and wanted to pay, he makes a move and suddenly we get ""on the house"" both the desert and digestive mastica lquor.This is actually what is all about, food was really good, not outstanding but really good, however, end of the night, feeling that you were really welcome somewhere that people are not just commercially into you but really cares about you makes the difference.I strongly reccommend ""Piatsa Gourounaki"" or what they called over there the piggy place for the people who really cares for excellent service, adding crazy cheap prices for such a lovely pork and chicken dishes; 5 stars!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,In the old city centre. Fast service.Pleasant staff. Great food mostly Kebab and salads.Value for money. Reasonable spirit prices.Quality stable all times.We will go there again and again.Friendly owners.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Four of us visited the restaurant. We were warmly welcomed and seated very quickly. The menu is mainly meat based, but although short gave me the confidence that everything was fresh. Certainly the four meals were excellent and served quickly. Good draught beers although the wine was only Ok. We had plenty to eat and drink and enjoyed the chat from our waiting staff. Icing on the cake was the very inexpensive bill.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Everything you could want from a restaurant. Great food; service; atmosphere and inexpensive. Situated in the old part of Nicosia near Ledras Street. The waiters are helpful and the service quick. You have to like meat though, fish eaters look elsewhere. A great night.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This restaurant is situated in the city center, it is full of life, serves excellent food at super good prices. I would highly recommend this to anyone!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I have been here with some friends for lunch and we were surprised by the friendliest and fastest service we have experienced so far in Cyprus. The plates were very consistent and at a good price. If we ever return to Nicosia, we will definitely come and eat here again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went here early (around 7) with a large group and got two tables next to each other. The server was great and able to recommend all sorts of dishes we would like. Several of us shared the meals for two - this is a great deal and gives you a little taste of everything. Prices couldn't be beat - and coupled with the great service, this should be one of your first stops in Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is a super place!I own a large restaurant myself and most of the time I am disappointed when I go to other places.This was good in all ways. Food quality. Taste. Service. Environment. Prices. And food is delivered for easy sharing and this promotes relaxed and social chats. If you want a real Greek food experience, this is it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Fantastic food. Friendly staff. Very good service. Good location. Good atmosphere. The owners of the restaurant are very kind. Value for money.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Friendly staff and very good food. The food is just enough for the people so there is no waste and the staff were available at all times.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Great cypriot feasts to be enjoyed here. Do book if your planning on going on a saturday night. I enjoy the place and the food more on a quieter week night. Great souvlaki joint, great tastes.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Welcoming, good atmosphere, air conditioning, great food, expert service, more than reasonable prices. Highly recommend.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Located in an interesting spot of old Nicosia, which has become quite trendy lately, Piatsa Gourounaki is a very popular place, especially with younger people (probably related to its prices) therefore invariably crowded. Rather limited choice of dishes, mostly based on grilled meat in various forms (the name is a tell-tale as the word ""gourounaki"" means piglet). The service is good, the food average, nothing to write home about!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Friendly environment with tasty food!personnel ready to satisfy your requirements!easy to find!family had a great time!,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"We went there with a couple of friends, it was summer and we had to wait for like...half an hour. When we got in we had to wait again for a 10-15 minutes for someone to come give us some menus! Truth is, I didn't enjoy the food nor the environment of this restaurant and wouldn't visit again.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Prices are, maybe the best highlight of this taverna. Nothing exciting or eye popping. Should invest more on sweets for desert,",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Mouthwatering food and the quality is always up to standards and consistent, which is important for a restaurant to survive...Always busy, they take no reservations, so if you want a table, be there early and embrace the rest of the crowd that is also trying to get a table...so extra early is a must!Meat platter is delicious and value for money and a special treat, after you meal, they serve you a delicious light dessert, that will satisfy any dessert or non dessert lover..",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food, a lot of variety and very nice platters. very low prices for the quality and quantity you get.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,When there is not much people you can have a good service and good food.....when is full is better to think twice.....,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I and my friends decided to have a late lunch in Nicosia, looked through tripadvisor and found this restaurant as number one. So we drove from Ayia Napa and managed to get here before the kitchen closes. Totally worth it! The food portions were huge and tasty. The customer service was really on top and we had a lovely time.. Lots of complimentary food and drinks. Thank you so much for making this the highlight of our Nicosia visit! Totally recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Interesting area of old Nicosia in the South, new cafes and restaurants popping up near Faneromeni down towards the Buffer Zone.A local friend who loves the place took me here. I usually stick to non-meat food, particularly in places I'm not familiar with, but today we went for the meat platter for 2 for lunch. Great variations on chicken, lamb, pork. Comes with grilled vegetables. Delicious.Ambiance: modern Cypriot European.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"I really wanted to love this place but the food was nothing great...its ""street Greek food"" more than a proper restaurant.The not so good: There were 3 of us and they brought out 2 meals and we finished eating by the time they brought out the 3rd persons meal. The packed in tables combined with the heavy metal music playing at the time we where there made it not such a pleasant dining experience.The good: Good customer service from the welcoming waiters. Well priced. Nice fit outs, decor and branding.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"Mass production food, oily too much oil especially on the vegetables in the platter , bad dinning experienceTables in the dinning room are very close to each other you could overhear what people were saying and people could hear everything I was saying.No privacy, in an attempt for the owners to sit as many people as possible they have given up the privacy of customers and that made me and my partner feel very uncomfortable",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food and service at this restaurant is second to none, the staff are so friendly and efficient. We had a meat platter for two which was enormous and served with chips and dips. Was so good with lots of different pieces of chicken and pork kebabs and oven roasted vegetables. We were so impressed with the food. Most people seemed to go for the platters but you could choose anything from the menu which was fairly extensive. The restaurant is open at lunch time, then closes and re opens at 19.00 and gets very busy due to its popularity. This is a must visit, you will not be disappointed with anything. Wish there was one in Paphos.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Visited this place twice during June . I heard very good comments about it so I felt like I had to try it. Knowing that they do not do reservations I went there for an early dinner. The welcoming staff was very polite, the menu very interesting, the food tasty and the portions very large. The service was excellent and the prices very reasonable. Place is highly recommended for a casual dinner or s family lunch",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Sometimes success make the restaurants a mass production line. This is the case with this restaurant, although the food is good it is not special; the service is right but not exceptional lacks personality; the location is good but not relaxing. It is more an upgrading fast food rather than a restaurant",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went there twice. First time we had a cheap but excellent greek salad. The second time we tried a mezze, we enjoyed it a lot and they offered us dessert. Waiters are very nice, and speak english.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Went there for dinner with a friend after having found it ranking on number 1 on Tripadvisor restaurants for Nicosia - and the place deserves its ranking! On a Saturday night it was packed and people were queuing outside waiting for tables to become available. Great grill food at a very reasonable price, coming in large portions. And even though it was super busy the staff managed to remain friendly and joking all the way through - quite an achievement!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I am visiting Nicosia very rare as i prefer the seaside towns of the island. I wasnt expecting such a nice atmosphere in the old town of the capital. Everything was matching together and when we were hungry we choose this restaurant. Food was plenty, cheap and absolutely delicious! The staff was really pleasant to serve us and they were smiling and being kind all the time with us, even the manager/chef came out to have a little chat with us! I would suggest this place without second thought...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Well worth a visit,try late lunchtime as it's less busy. Main chap on front of house is excellent and looked after us for the whole time,all the food is great and the wine and beers top value. Just let them recommend things to try,they are proud of being great value and not looking to take you for a ride. Chef and owner came out to see if we were enjoying ourselves and ended up chatting for an hour and a half! They deserve to be top of trip advisor as the team all make huge efforts to make sure all their customers are happy. Great visit.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,A nice place in the heart of old town. Nice fresh food in good quality and quantity. Meat platters are great and value for money.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Great food and large portions. Did order the dish of the day that contained no meat and it was really delicious!! Chick peas with spinach! Kids enjoyed their pork kebab. Very tender.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Walking around Lydras Street, we tried to find a restaurant that was not littered with tourists and we did. Set off the main drag, this was a find. The interior is stable like and earthy, with menus written on boards and also there are menus that look like a blackboard but are cardboard. All staff are dressed as stable hands in black and the kitchen is open so you can see what's cooking. We ordered a chicken grill platter for 2 which included grilled thigh fillets, chicken kebab and souvlaki with freshly grilled vegetables, freshly fried potatoes, warm pitta bread and tzatziki- yogurt cucumber and garlic. A Greek village salad which also had caper berries and we ate an absolutely delicious lunch with a litre bottle of cold water. Beers are served on tap and they appeared to be cold as did the glasses in which they were served. The staff were excellent and recommended we be careful with ordering too much, as the fare was plentiful. He was absolutely correct and we left some. Actually, the platter is enough for 3. They brought out a velvet like custard dessert infused with rose water and sour cherries and the bill came to 20.00 euro- yes ...you read correct. To impress just that little bit more, the chef walked around and asked if we were all ok with our food, if we were enjoying it and if we needed anything else. Obviously, he owns the restaurant too...but what a touch - I liked it- he impressed me. It was busy and packed with locals from students to local business men and families. Toilets were clean but could have been better. Parking is not easy in the area but it is worth the visit. Restaurant name translated is place of little pigs. Sure you can have a pig out..but it is really worth it",Piatsa Gourounaki
10,"Low quality food, spices allover, oily meats you get what you pay for though low for low quality. I wouldnt come back",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We visited this place and was pleasantly surprised by the very helpful and polite staff. The food was superb and gray value for money.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The food was very nice and the place had a good ambiance with quick and very friendly service. Location very convenient in the Onasagorou Street pedestrian walkway.,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"This past Friday, my boyfriend and I decided to go downtown for dinner. So we thought to give this restaurant an other chance because the food is very good and the price is affordable. Since my last dessert experience that I had there (had to split the dessert and the waiter didn't pay us much attention) I thought that I should go there with a good attitude and hopefully to have a good meal. As soon as we got there, even though it was packed, we were seated right away, because we were just two. We were seated right next to the entrance door and the reason why I mention this is because any waiter could see us as they were moving in and out. Unfortunately, we got the same waiter like last time, but this time I got his name, Ismael. He quickly took our order and he quickly brought our beers and quickly he spilled some of mine over my phone. He quickly apologized and brought me some extra napkins. Food was great and arrived soon enough. Unfortunately though as soon as we finished and someone collected some of our empty plates, dessert didn't arrive. For 20 minutes we were trying to get the attention on any waiter but unfortunately no one was paying attention until George (blue eyes, beard and nice smile) saw my frustration and asked if we were waiting on dessert. I said that at this point I believe that we should get the check. He said, that he was going to take care of us and HE DID. He not only brought us the dessert, he also offered us mastic liquor and after he found out about the spilling of my drink, he took out of the check the drinks. Moreover when I was paying I wanted to include the tip with my credit card but he said that it was ok. I refused and left a tip because he deserved it. What a great waiter!! I am sure Ismael can do better and I hope that he will.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"after three rounds of walking through the central part of the old Nicosia we decided to sit down in this place for a dinner. A great decission - we did it again the next day for lunch ;) Really tasty, lively, friendly. Will visit again!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We made a special trip to the city to find Piatsa gourounaki and it was well worth the 64 km trip, the food was truly scrumptious , the service was very good will we go back hell yes.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Excellent food at a great price. I cannot fault this restaurant and I suggest you track it down too!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Good food and service. The restaurant didn't open until 12.30 pm for some reason but it was well worth the wait!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food. Perfect service. Friendly. Great atmosphere. Convenient, affordable. What can I say? The only negative may be that the place is so go and so popular that you may have to wait to be seated. We love the restaurant. A must try.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"After about a year passing by this place and not going in, we did so a couple of nights ago and we are glad about our decision. The service was very friendly and very efficient. The portions are huge but most importantly the food is excellent. The grilled plater for two is more than enough for three. A half litre of wine costs the grand total of five euros. So for two people we paid twenty euros and we took food home for lunch! Highly recommended",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Visited this restaurant at 830 tonight.There was a queue to get a place but we were dealt with really quickly and were served just as quick.The table service was top class and the food was really good.Complimentary desert and 27 euro for a hell of a lot of food for two and 2 large beers.Will definitely be back,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"My wife and I were booked for a 2 night stay at the Nicosia City Centre Hotel. I looked at Trip Advisor to find a nearby restaurant and what a find this was. So good, there was never any doubt after the first night that we would return for the second. We ordered a meat platter and a carafe of red wine. On the first night the waiter brought a cold carafe. I tried to explain I wanted it room temperature but his English was limited so I gave up. We began to drink the wine when after a few minutes George ( head waiter/owner?) came over and changed the carafe. Obviously the original waiter had taken the time to find out the problem, which was resolved with a smile.On both nights we stuck to the platter with a carafe.the second night we did not need to say we wanted the red wine at room temperature - it just arrived. The food was excellent and the amount enough to discourage a real trencherman. The service was attentive and cheerful without being overbearing. The price was also pleasantly affordable.To summarise - thank you Trip Advisor for pointing the way to an excellent restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This was a lovely afternoon lunch! The staff were kind and considerate too!The food was outstanding and plentiful! 5 of us ate for 43 EUROS -including drinks! and free dessert!We were all stuffed> note to those who eat a lot- like me *** I was so full***,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We were a group of 8 people and shared the meat platter and vegetarian platters too. They were delicious. their souvlaki also is nice. very good prices. The service was exceptional too!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We had the meat platter, all the food was delicious and lots of it for a good price! We even received a free dessert to share which was really good too.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,souvlaki with a twist. It works and the quality is good. prices are ok for the portions. Only annoying bit is the waiting to be seated as its always packed with people and you never get that quietness to enjoy your food. Better than most places in its neighborhood.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We have visited this restautant several times and have been fully satisfied. The food is very good, matched with friendly and efficient service. Look for Rade, he is always there ready to help.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,My friend and I ate at this restaurant twice in four days. It was that good. Both times we sat outside and enjoyed the balmy air and people watching. I had a Greek salad both times and fried Greek cheese. The salad was huge and the ingredients were fresh crispy. The staff were very friendly and funny. It was a real Greek treat to eat there. I recommend the restaurant.,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,Arrived at this restaurant and got a table immediately. The food was ok not as good as expected... but the worse thing was that in the middle of the meal they brought us the bill. We have not even finish eating. They told us that they are closing in 10 minutes. In any restaurant if you get a table and they are closing soon they will tell you that. What it should have been a nice meal after a hard working day ended up been a disaster. I will be again in Nicosia but for sure not at this restaurant.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,As far as value for money this is one of the best places in Nicosia to have lunch/dinner. Good variety of Cypriot/Greek cuisine with very reasonable prices.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went to nicosia for the afternoon having dumped the little fella with relatives. Played some Tavli in a local cafe - when we checked the best restaurant on TA in nicosia was 100m away from us so we eagerly made our way there.It's quite a modern affair and occupies a corner slot in a nice little alleyway beside the church. Very bright, airy and busy. Cypriot music blaring out and service is excellent and friendly.We went for the chicken platter for sharing - be aware that the portions are huge and there is more than enough food for 3 in this set up and if you were happy with a light lunch you could stretch to 3. Platter consists of grilled vegetables, 3 x 2 of souvlaki, chicken kebab and barbs chicken piece. This with a side portion of wonderful crispy chips and it was truly a wonderful meal. You get either a free dessert or shot of masticha to finish off your meal - great value.The only problem is that now we have eaten at best restaurant on first day it will be hard to follow it up I think for value and sheer portion size. Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Wow - I read the reviews so sought it out and wasn't disappointed - customer service at its best, nothing too much trouble, and the food was fabulous .... We will definitely be going back before we leave üëçüèª",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"this is a type of place usually found in Greece, food is good and so are the prices, no booking just go there and once seated u r served within minutes",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Cozy place with good food! at a central location in the old town. unfortunately always packed.......!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food there was amazing, good portions and good service. The place, though, is always crowded and in busy days you could find yourself waiting for 20 minutes to get a table. It's not the restaurant's fault but you should be careful to avoid waiting so long and either book a table or go there early enough.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"great food, good prices with excellent service, central location and traditional tastes in a modern version Generally value for money spent",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great place. Good food. Good service. Can improve the queue problem. No need to wait half an hour to take a seat!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Food was very good and portions were big, and service was excellent. Very attentive and very express. Value for money all round.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Very nice restaurant. Quite big portions and reasonable prices. Service is ok considering how crowded the place is. Too much noice while having your meal. But i will visit the place again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food is very good and plentiful, at excellent prices, No wonder there are queues ! Recommended for meat lovers, although there is plenty for no meat eaters.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Even though there are many different traditional taverns around Nicosia serving a really tasty greek and Cypriot souvlaki (kebab), Piatsa Gourounaki offers a different type of experience with platters having a variety of meat and sides rather that a plate with kebab and salat. Because of this difference with traditional taverns, the prices are a bit higher but still great value.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent traditional grilled meats with a very creative approach and a very good value for money. The only ""problem"" is that they take no reservations and every time I attempt to go they are full. Of course if you don't mind waiting a bit, a table will always become available within a few minutes.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"a no pretenses casual meat lovers restaurant. great and tasty food, souvlaki & more at its best. affordable prices. service with a smile. no decent wine available, but can live with that. a place to return and return and return",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"Generally a good place to eat. Service was ok, food wasnt bad. Its usually busy because of its location",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Fast food with ambiance! Enjoyable outdoors dining. No reservations taken, quick service, tasty meat platters.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"First time I discovered this restaurant, near the Faneromeni Church in Nicosia, it was 10 months ago.Since that day, every time I want to have a tasty grilled meal I go to Piatsa Gourounaki. The reason ??.....Very good food, local grilled dishes, fantastic service, staff very helpful and always smiling and..... last but not least: reasonable prices.!!! So, do visit the Piatsa Gourounaki and Bon Appetit.!!!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,One of the best restaurants inside the walls of nicosia. Value for money. Been there almost every week.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food, at the most reasonable prices. The best service I have experienced in a long time. The ""no reservations"" policy is really working well and keeps the place packed and no customer dissatisfied",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We had a very tasty lunch here on a weekday. Service was friendly and attentive and prices are low. Quality does not suffer from it and neither does quantity. Would definitely visit again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This place is a must visit for anyone in Nicosia who wants to soak up the real Nicosia atmosphere inside the walled city and enjoy traditional and modern interpretations of Cypriot cuisine. They don't take bookings because they are always busy, but the friendly staff will soon find you a table, and the chef/owner is rightly proud of his offer and makes a point of making sure that every table is happy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,A very nice place at Onasagorou street very close to Ledra Street. Great food with very reasonable prices. No reservations can be made though,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"You are dealing with real professionals in this restaurant. Excellent marinated meat or chicken, huge portions,friendly service .... and excellent prices.No surprise if it will stay number one for a long time.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This restaurant in downtown Nicosia is incredibly popular! The food, which is mainly kebabs is actually very nice, good size portions, friendly staff and the prices are good! The only problem is that you feel the meal is slightly rushed because of the lines of people waiting to be seated and it would be great if we could book a table beforehand!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great hosts, made to feel very welcome, even when it poured down with rain!!! Couldn't ask for better food or service !!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Lovely location. Excellent food and good service. An overall wonderful experience, soon to be repeated. Great value for money.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very nice atmosphere. Perfect and friendly staff. Wonderfull place. And of course the food is delicious. The sweet and liquor is from the house!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I visites this place for the first time a year ago and I keep coming back. The food is always great and cheap. We usually get the platter for two plus a greek salad, 2 extra dips, water and wine and never pay more than 23 euros. The quality is always amazing. The platter costs around 15 euros and has lots of souvlaki, pitta, chicken, grilled vegetables and dips. The place might look packed outside with people waiting to be sitted but it never takes more than 10 minutes. Souvlaki with a lovely twist plus a free desert at the end. Totally recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Again the result and the overall experience was great. For sure the quality of the food was perfect. That sauce with mayo oooo. Do recommend it with out a doubt.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"A very popular, easy-going restaurant with very fresh, simple food; high quality and quick service. I recommend the ""graviera fakelomeni"" (cheese wrapped with delicate honey flavour) and of course the souvlaki.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Recommended by our hotel and was a great find. Food so good we ate there for both nights of our stay in Nicosia. Lovely food and friendly staff. A must for anyone. Fantastic value. We will be back.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Lucky enough to get a table immediately at this popular downtown restaurant and we were not disappointed by any aspect of the restaurant. The waiters were knowledgeable and helpful going so far as to recommend when we had over-ordered, and they stayed at a discrete distance till we needed them and the were immediately attentive when needed. The food that then followed as perfect, we tried the meat and chicken platter that we;re both cooked to perfection and the Bacon Pansetaki which was divine. Topping the experience off was the visits by the Chef and owner of the restaurant to the full tables to ensure everything was perfect. These are all great signs of a great restaurant and we will definitely be returning.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Juicy kebabs served by energetic waiters in the now uber trendy old part of Nicosia. Very popular with locals. It's mainly Greek and not Cypriot food,Piatsa Gourounaki
10,We visited the place because we had been told it was very good. Pork and chicken in pitta was good. The rest of the menu was really bad. I wouldn't go again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Rarely I was served in such a kind way. The staff showed courtesy from the welcome to the end of the dinner; food arrived quickly at the table, freshly grilled; despite the cheap price, portion were large. When you ask the bill, they use to serve a complimentary dessert and drink.This is the way to run a restaurant. Successful, well deserved.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This place is friendly. Great, simple, delicious, healthy food. They are so hospitable giving us free side dishes, explaining all the dishes, modifying etc. Definitely recommend. Great buzz. All the locals seem to come here for a Saturday lunch.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Service excellent, food nice and hearty and affordable! Friendly staff and indeed crowded. We even had free samples of Mastika after the dinner! Kudos!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"A restaurant into the heart of the old city of Nicosia...the food is delicious, big portion and the most important in very logical prices...recommended!!! I think is ideal for tourists!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This place is amazing, perfect. The staff are so helpful, asked if we had any questions about the menu and made suggestions about taste pairings. You can order a small amount then add sauces and sides so it's a perfect concept for whatever appetite. We don't drink a lot so it's also good to get wine in a smaller carafe. We had the chicken and lamb with tahini and honey mustard sauces, so juicy and flavoursome. The salad had little peppers, onions, capers, leaves, tomatoes and a little feta cheese. If I lived in Nicosia I would eat here every day. The place is busy, tonight people were only waiting ten or fifteen minutes to get a seat though. We had four skewers of kebab, salad, water and wine and the bill was only eighteen euros, incredible value.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"...among locals, but you won't be disappointed. Good selection of local food and drink plus good selection of European beer all at very affordable prices makes this a no lose and enjoyable experience.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great, tasty and fresh meat for food lovers. Easier to find place to sit if you visit it for lunch on weekdays.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"the food is excellent and fresh, the service fast and prices fair, the only negative is that you can not make reservation and sometimes the line is too big..",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The meal was tasty, the service was excellent and general we have great time with my family, recommended for family and couples",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very nice casual restaurant with nice fresh and cheap food. Very nice souvlaki. I will definetly go again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,If you like kebab and grill-food then you visit the place. Prices are fair. Fast service and good variety. On the negative side is waiting time to be seated (you rarely see empty tables) and rather noisy if you seat inside.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Delicious food, very quick and excellent service, the prices are very good and not expensive. You cannot make a reservation, if you go and there is no empty table you have to stay in line until your turn comes to get a table.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Excellent food. Centrally located. Only disadvantage is that they don't make reservations. There is parking but not right next to it as it is situated in the pedestrian area,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I have been there quite a few times before October. It is a Very lively place, fresh food, quite tasty and reasonably priced",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,No reservation available. So the queue can be quite long during busy hours. Excellent value for money. Huge platter. Only downside is that the tables are quite close to each other.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went there (2 persons + 1 baby) for a quick lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon.They were full, and they told us to come back in 20mins in order to get a specific table that we wanted (we had a pram with us too). We did and we were serviced quickly.Food was brilliant - sausage and politiki kebab is a must try!Also had the house white wine - also very good.Fully recommend.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,It is an absolutely value for money choice!!! You should visit it right now! Keep in mind that it operates without reservations!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I would like to thank this wonderful place and its people for the hospitality! Every time I visit this place I always feel welcome! And the food of course is one of the best I tried. Recommend it to everyone! ‚ù§Ô∏è,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Big plates, centrally located good staff, we was 4 and we eat and drink with 60 euros eating 2 big plates for sharing and 7 beer... Sweet and liquor offered",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Regular customer. Food is great, service is excellent and atmosphere good (I don't particularly like the music but thats a matter of taste). Great value for price.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great foods, great time. Recommend to take the chicken plate, it costs 15.50 euros for 2. It comes in a large plate with fries, vegetables and all kinds of chicken.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We liked it. Friendly waiters. Great and lots of food. Chicken was so nice !! Take the platter and some saganaki !! You ll be lucky to get a table,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,I visited the place some months ago and promised my self to visit it again. My last visit was terrible. We waited for over 35 minutes to be seated and many companies who came after us were served earlier (no reservations are offered). The reception guy also responsible for table arrangement enjoyed the 'power' to select people to serve. When finally seated the food didn't remind me the last time experience. The french fries were fried in bad oil (don't know when they changed it last time). I understand that too much work is tiring but this does not justify the waiters behavour !,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"In my previous review, Piatsa Gourounaki has received 5 stars from me, because we went there 3 times within two weeks and both the food and the service were excellent. Now one year after, the food is still excellent, but what happened to the service? Really awful! On a Saturday evening, there was only one person taking orders in the whole full restaurant! So we had to wait until ""the right person"" decided not to ignore us. Then the wine was not good and had to be changed. But nobody could do that, except for that one guy. By the time he came to us and took the wine to change, we were almost done with our meal. Also, I wanted to order one more grilled halloumi. The person I could catch said he can't take any orders and we had to wait again for that only one guy. He finally came and took the order. But at the end we received two portions of grilled halloumi, which - like the rest of the dinner - was kind of thrown on our table, with the waiter running away in less than a second. So we basically didn't even had a chance to tell them that there has been a mistake. Paying one more portion of grilled halloumi is not annoying, but being ignored and receiving a horrible service in one of your favorite restaurants is. I hope they improve and go back to original.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"The food was great and the service very good. For 2 people, the bill was 24 euros, which is more than correct. BUT WE PAID WITH VISA CARD and we were stupid enough not to check the input. Back at our hotel, we realised than we had been charged 24 euros + 4 EUROS TIPS !!!! In Cyprus, VAT and service is ALWAYS included in the price. We introduced a complaint and the answer was : we were right, it is a mistake, they will fire the waiter. But in the meantime the manager pocketed our 4 euros and did not even offer us a compensation. In short, if you ever go there, check everything, the food is great but they are THIEVES;",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Food was great, servings was huge, platter for 2 was too much for the two of us. Can definitely recommend the place. And the prices are low compared to limassol where I live! Service was great too, waiters are friendly and always available!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The way to rate a restaurant is: everytime you go, the food is the same standard. This is the place where the food just melts in your mouth. The variety of meat...amazing! Definitely recommend it! Always full but its worth waiting for a table.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"All sort of kebabs! Chicken kebab was particularly juicy. Salads are good too. It's simple, but very functional. Very popular with Cypriots.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Really nice restaurant, with really good Greek food on the grill. No reservations can be done. It works on a first come first served basis. It gets too crowded during weekends, so waiting time may exceed the hour!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The menu looked brilliant! We choose the chicken platter for 2! One word ""Superb"". If you don't do here whilst in Nicosia, you've totally missed out!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This should be the place you choose to try Greek gyro if you are in the area. The food is tasty and freshly made, reasonably priced and the ambiance is comfortable. It is however packed during weekends and they do not accept reservations. A lot of people with younger children choose this place-including myself-so be advised! Definitely a place to try though.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Even-though you have to wait to get a table (very very busy shop) they offer great food, especially their platters, love the low prices as well üòÅ ! Highly recommenced just be patient it deserve it !",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I cannot fault this restaurant.The food, service, atmosphere, staff and prices are all excellent. I have tried a number of the dishes and they are all good but the salads are outstanding.It does get very busy, particularly at the weekends and on summer evenings, but I think it is worth waiting for.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Although busy, we gave our names and were told to come back in 20 minutes. We were shown straight to our seats on return. Food was really good and plentiful. We went for a 2 person platter and small side salad, great value and the service was great, even when very busy. Will visit again and recommend.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"This was the third time to have a meal there and the experience was very disappointing. Though the first two times we were a group of 6, the service was great and the food delicious. We all got at the end a small dessert, complimentary of the restaurant. So I was under the impression that this happens every time, but unfortunately it is not the case. We are a family of 4 and we were seated at a table that the waiters were barely noticing us and we had to ask twice for a bottle of water. Moreover at the end when they brought the complimentary dessert, they only brought two of those and 4 spoons to share.......not very complimentary. So for 10 minutes I was trying to get the waiters attention but impossible though the tavern was not very crowded!! So we shared our desserts and I wanted to pay but again, they wouldn't notice us. So I got up and went to pay at the bar. I asked one of the personnel why this time we had to share our dessert and his answer was that that's their policy.........funny thing is that this policy doesn't always apply and obviously not to every table because the two tables next to us didn't have to share their dessert!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This was our first evening in Nicosia. We decided to eat in the old city. Trusted our own luck and just walked between empty places in the winter night. Then out of the blue (or black) came this place. Really busy, but a nice doorman fixed us a table for two. The service was excellent and so was the food. Really good value for money. When we later checked TripAdvisor we did see that the majority of other users also loved the place. Maybe we should start to use TripAdvisor more frequently? (But just trust own luck is in away more exciting. ...)",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very good food, service and ambiance... Also the food is very nicely presented. However do not go on Saturdays because it's overpacked and too loud.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We go as a family-three boys 17.10 and 2 years old- to this restaurant for a long time. The food is always tasty! The people are polite and friendly and they really care about what they serve. It is always clean and the food is fresh and cooked at that time (not precooked). More over I believe that they do not put any chemicals to make the meat softer for kebab because you do not have any bad 'gastrenterical' feelings after you eat it or the next day. The price is more than reasonable and they always bring you a tasty cream after food for free. People who go there are from all ages. The only thing that you should have in mind is that they do not make reservations so if you do not want to wait your turn to get in it is better to go early at about 7-7.30 for dinner. When the weather is good - summer and autumn- it is very nice to sit outside- the location is perfect down town in the walking streets (no cars) of old Nicosia.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very nice place if you are looking where to go for lunch or dinner in Nicosia. I really like this place,is clean, with a good quality food..and friendly staff! Fast service and reasonable prices!! Have to try it!",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,Very good value for money . Always excellent service and pleasant atmosphere. In the old town of Nicosia,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"All the platters are great in terms of quality and quantity. Also, the prices are low and the atmosphere is great.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"very good service! Well done to the staff! all we asked for, they were keen to provide. Will visit again for sure",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,its a great and cosy place to visit with friends and family for a nice casual lunch or dinner. Friendly staff and excellent prices make it as my favourite choice for a sunday lunch destination. Only disadvantage that you cant book table.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We usually visit this restaurant for Sunday lunch. Service is always exellent. It is located in Nicosia old town. Food is great!. I definitely recommend it. Please visit the place and you will realise that I'm right!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Nice restaurant, and nice setting.! Liked the decor, and how clean it was. Polite service. Higly recommended.!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Certainly worthy of No.1 rest. in Nicosia. Cold wet nite but food & nice staff quickly warmed us up!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Came early for a Sunday lunch. Place was already full. That didn't affect the service or the quality of the food. Definitely coming back.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Over the past years, while wandering around the evening scene of Nicosia, I have passed this restaurant many times. I have always been put off by the queue, but always wondered what was so good that people will queue on a cold winter night. Today, a quiet Thursday lunch, while passing with friends, I said let's try this. My dad always says if you want a fish and chip shop, look for the one with the queue.What was great for me, in such an establishment, was to find such a treat for vegetarians. I shared a veggie platter with my daughter and it was fantastic. We had the house wine, and it was pleasantly drinkable. The service is incredible, very friendly, happy to explain the menu, and very polite. The tables were put together very quickly to accommodate the 5 of us (where other restaurants have refused to do so).The boys had a meat platter between them, and they were impressed too.Smashing value, excellently cooked, very tasty, I can't recommend it enough.I just wish I'd queued up all those years ago!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very clean and friendly restaurant. The location was very good.I recomend a table outside.The food was tradition.Very clean and friendly restaurant. The location was very good.I recomend a table outside.The food was tradition.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I visited the restaurant with some friends in the end of January and was very impressed with how good the food was and how affordable it was considering the quality of the food. The staff was very polite and eager to assist us and also the manager was very kind and a very nice person as well. Other than the amazing food and the excellent service what really made me love this place was the fact that the owner offered a warm seat and some food to an older gentleman who was looking to sell some flowers. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful restaurant with excellent food in the middle of the old town.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We tried this restaurant on a quiet weekday for lunch. We usually pass by it on weekends, and never attempt to go in due to the queue outside. We figured it must be good if people queue for it. I was told by a friend that it doesn't take reservations, so when passing by on a weekday, we couldn't resist trying it.It's good. We tried the meat meze and everything was tasty, well-prepared and well-presented. The service was fast and efficient. They had run out of the couple of beers we tried to order, but hopefully it was a one-time thing. The prices are also quite good.Overall, I would recommend it, even though I cannot be sure the quality of service is the same on busy days. Our experience was great though.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,This is one of the best Greek style souvlaki in town. Soft meats and nice ambient and fast service. A bit limited choice of dishes but is ok.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This has to be my favorite in nicosia for souvlaki the portions are great and their wine also. The only problem is it gets packed verry quickly as there is no booking a table, you just show up and get a table if your lucky sometimes the wait can reach up to half an hour depending what time you go. As for the food its all great whatever you order.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"One of the best places in old town of Nicosia to eat tasty!!!! I took a meat platter which was very tasty!!! This place worth it. As well the staff is very helpful and friendly! It's better to book a table if you go for dinner on Saturday night, or wait around 15-20 min outside till a table will be available. Good appetite!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Did I mention the cheese pastry? That was the savory highlight. Great service, low prices, clean (if small) bathrooms, free wifi.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Our usual problem when we are visiting Nicosia is to find a good place to have lunch.Can say that most of the times that we tried some restaurants we were disappointed.This time we visited Piatsa Gourounaki close to Lydras street and we were impressed a lot.You can find in specific restaurant all kind of meet cooked in charcoal. We tried Kebab, lab souvlaki and chicken souvlaki and all were very nicebut we recommend other dishes without meat!The dip with blue cheese, Graviera cheese in pastry and the caramelized onions were all unbelievable!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food, big portions and serve as fast as possible considering it's always crowded. Value for money for sure. They don't have 100 dishes to choose from, but what they do, they do it really good. Recommended, don't miss it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Shared the chicken plate for 2. Reviews are right. The food was great and plentiful. The chicken ""drumstick"" was the best. It was actually boneless marinated thigh meat. Very tender and juicy. Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great atmosphere, great food and great price. Little bit annoying of waiting at line since they don't accept reservations. If you seat outside is also annoying have people near you waiting at line until you finish your meal",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We loved it! A very nice, clean and well decorated place to visit. Staff was very friendly and very willing to serve us. Food was very very tasty, cooked very well and quantity was ok. They also offer you cypriot sweet which is delicious too. Defenetly recomend you this place",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very tastefull food in a relaxed casual restaurant . A place you can taste excellent grilled chicken platter.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"There is absolutely nothing that can be done to improve the place as it is already at the top!!! Friendly staff, fast service, excellent food, very very reasonable prices. What more can you ask for. Nothing as they have it all.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food was wonderful! And the music was magical! I recommend it, to all! It's worth to go with friends or with family!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Simple but delicious food, plate for two is enough for four, good, attentive and fast service. Expectedly crowdy, but it doesn't bother.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"very fast serving, excellent food..great value for what you get...no wander is always crowded. The place is simple and not pretentious ,we had a good time.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Tasteful and delicious food! Excellent service! The quality was high! The prices were very ok and the portion of the dishes was big. Beautiful decoration! Easy to find in the heart of the old city!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,It does not serve typical cypriot dishes. The service is really fast and the food is more than you can eat. it can sure get pretty packed sometimes and the sitting area outside could be more comfortable and cozy.. Good value for money.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"No wonder this place is packed and people wait in the cold outside for the table, their food is really, really good, service fast and friendly, and prices very reasonable. Platter for 2 is a lovely spread (with meat and grilled veggies), and their tomato, feta and basil salad is delicious! Try caramelized onions, they bring something extra to traditional Greek grill!In short, don't miss this place if you are in Nicosia, but try to get there around 12.30pm to avoid queueing!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The place is great. Although we had to wait for a table because the place was packed, we had a great time here. It comes as no surprise that it is so crowded there. The food is great and the service nice and friendly.That's definitely the best place we stumbled upon in the Old Town.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We had a short wait to be seated due to the popularity of the restaurant (no bar or waiting area - only small disappointment) but it was well worth the wait! This is a fast service restaurant that packs in the customers but doesn't feel rushed. Everything we ordered was delicious. We loved the meat sharing platter which was huge and incredible value for money. The carafes of wine were ideal (we got though a litre of red very easily!). Due to mix up with our order the nice waiter gave us desert and liquor on the house! The biggest shock of the night was the bill which was only 35 euros for 2 people including 2 courses and wine. Highly recommend if in Nicosia.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Wonderful restaurant, the deal is a shared plate with typical cypriot food. Grilled meats and vegetables. They have a vegetarian selection too and gave out complimentary desserts and liqueur . Place was packed with mainly local crowd. Very good value for money.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I have visited this place for a couple of times all ending in great satisfaction. The food is good and the service is way above the average compared to similar places.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"the staff,owner, manger, food (the meet/ chicken platers), deserts all these make this resturant best velue for money in nicosia and cyprus.each time we are visiting there, if just friends, couples or families we enjoy the food and the service.i will visit often for sure and already recommended to all of our friends.the only cons is that resrvation are not optional.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food. Value for money. Great service. Full marks! The owner himself helped us with our order, and checked back on us a couple of times. The food arrived very quickly, and the staff were very attentive. I cant say enough good words about our experience!",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,Food was ok but way overpriced compared to similar establishments. Friendly staff but very crowded seating arrangements result in a NO recommendation in my book,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very quick service, relatively good quality food at a very good price. Music at times is very loud and some people are annoyed.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very good food mostly and the service was ok,the only negative is that the cuisine is closed too soon at 3 pm..",Piatsa Gourounaki

The staff are very friendly, and the head chef/owner went round the tables chatting to the customers, creating a very friendly and relaxed dining atmosphere. Highly recommended!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very good food and cheap too. Service immediate. A disadvantage, in my opinion, is that the tables are too close to each other, inside the restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Located in the old part of Nicosia, it is always our choice for a simple but quality meal when we are in the area.The food is tasteful, the place is clean, the service is excellent and the prices reasonable. Simply value for money!The only thing is that there is usually a queue, since you cannot make a reservation but we've never had to wait for long. And it is always worth the time!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Nicosia always needed the authentic cuisine of Greece... Piatsa Gourounaki not only succeeded that but also managed to offer to the clients the best service and prices.. I decently recommend to try it!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"i've there once, i had heard good comments. We went with family and friends. There are no reservations so it's pure luck if you can get a table. Fortunately, there are quite many of them. The food is very good, well cooked and has interesting dishes. Other than that, I wouldn't go again at peak time cause it's quite crowded and not very comfortable.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"The food was really good! Grilled meat was awesome! Nice atmosphere in the old town!!! Very fresh food and very tasty, very hospitable staff!!! Highly recommended!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki

40,A great place to eat out with friends. Food was tasty but not enough at my opinion.. Very good service,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"amazing honey mustard sauce which is a must. Good prices and perfect place. You do not have to book a table, there is a little waiting line but it depends on the day you are visiting. Overall i am very impressed.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This place is just excellent with a variety of dishes in amazing combination for the meat lover as well as for those looking for fresh Mediterranean ingredients. The staff are extremely friendly and the owner/head chef can be often seen checking up on clients and striking a conversation.The final price tag is extremely affordable and you can only leave this place wanting to come back for more !,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"No doubt about it, greek, you have to nibble on all what you can so you will enjoy the variety of dishes and flavors, go for it...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Awesome food! Cool atmosphere! This is a must go! It's a beautiful balance between traditional dishes and modern styling.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"An amazing place to visit being in Nicosia, in the heard of the old town. Excellent food in very reasonable prices. Friendly staff, always available to serve and help you. The only disadvantage that I can mention is that it is always crowded, but this is the price we pay in good restaurants....!!!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,first time experience was really bad as to time to be served and food quality. 2nd time was surprisingly a different experience everything ok,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I visited the restaurant with friends on 3 occasions. Each time we visited the place was very busy. After a few minutes a table was made available and we experienced wonderful food, simple and tasty. We ate plenty with drinks too for approximately 20 euros so very good value.The atmosphere is very relaxed, background music but not too loud. It allows you to actually have a conversation without having to raise your voice. The staff are friendly and helpful in explaining the various menu options. With each dish we were satisfied and full. The two owners are also very much involved in their business which I think is important and will come to your table, welcome you and chat.The location is wonderful in the heart of the old Nicosia. Beautiful old buildings with so much character. The restaurant has been decorated tastefully just to add to the experience. This area is full of life and is now the place for all sorts of entertainment. Not so long ago this area was a ghost town.A must see and taste experience on your trip to Nicosia, you will not be disappointed!!!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"One of the best kebab in town, always fresh and well cooked meat , good services and good prices. It's a choice will leave 100% satisfy",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Good spot, at the heart of the old town of Nicosia. Serves quality and tasty food. Nice and friendly environment. Reasonable prices and full of people every day! The name of the restaurant is strange but you are going to enjoy your food and drinks. I would re-visit this place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We had in mind to visit this restaurant; watching it climbs the ranking ladder on TripAdvisor and seeing it reaching and staying at the top.We tried to make a reservation; the operator replied that they don‚Äôt take reservations and that we will be seated when we arrive, and when he remembered it was for Saturday; he advised us to come as early as possible from the restaurant opening time of 12:30.We arrived at 12:35 and found a huge restaurant in a superb location in the old City; and 3 tables already seated; the reception was very warm; we were offered to select our table; which was a great privilege as the restaurant started to fill in few minutes, and the queue started to grow. We then understood why they are not taking reservations.The menu is very simple and clear in one page for English and the back for Greek. The prices were very low which prompted us to order a Large Salad, and 3 main in addition to 3 sides. The quantities turned to be very generous; almost double what is offered in other restaurants.The service was quick and very friendly; the waiters were moving like in a beehive.Besides the generous dishes offered all the way; all dishes were of the highest quality; starting with fresh Greek Salad with Feta Cheese and Kalamata Olives (the only restaurant serving such quality olives), followed by a tasty Caramelized Onion, extremely delicious Olive Paste with Sundried Tomatoes, and a real Tahini Sauce with generous Garlic and Lemon. The main course consisted of tasty and spicy Greek Sausage, great Glaourtlou Kebab with Tomato Sauce and perfect Grilled Vegetables, and finally the superb Politiko Chicken Kebab; the most delicious we ever had before; the mix was out of this world.We were offered a free Muhallabie with framboise sauce and a liqueur; all this for just 40 Euros; incredibly low price for such fantastic meal. It deserves the number 1 rank.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,This place is always crowded and with good reason. It's got a good ambiance both inside and outside and the food is reasonably priced and very good - a good couple of notches above the usual in Nicosia. No wonder it is usually abuzz.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very nice food, prices are very reasonable and food is indeed very nice. Will definately come again ..",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great atmosphere, really friendly staff, making you feel really welcome, excellent service and delicious food at very reasonable prices. We arrived, as they opened and within a few minutes, it was nearly full, never seen a restaurant fill so quickly! Lively atmosphere, with all age groups. We will definitely visit again, next time we are in Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Yummy fast-food souvlaki of various meats - chicken, pork and kontosouvli lamb. The mpifteki is delicious. Salads and starters are fresh and worth a try. The negative thing here is that they don't do reservations and almost always you will need to wait from 10 to 45 mins to be seated. This is quite unacceptable to me, they should consider seriously to start accepting reservations.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Service here was exceptional. Our waiter was very friendly without being annoying. The food was delicious particularly the cheese pastry dish. Our bill was tiny too we kept double checking it thinking they had missed something. We even got dessert and digestives on the house. One tip though, the food comes fairly quickly with little break between courses so don't order too much, its all very filling.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We visited Nicosia last Sunday and were looking for a place to eat around 3.30pm. Quickly checked TA and saw that we were 10min walk from Piatsa Gourounaki, rated #1 in Nicosia.Arrived there and found the place crowded to the top, filled with life and laughter, locals eating outside and enjoying a family Sunday late lunch. We really wanted to try it! There was a waiting list but we had to wait less than 15min as the staff is super efficient.The food was super good, enormous portions as always but very cheap. The atmosphere was relaxed and cheerful, service was nice and quick, and we got offered desert and digestive to finish off a great meal.We left the place super happy! :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
10,"Services was ok but food was mediocre, nothing special to be honest to deserve the first place in the list on here.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,The food sometimes is excellent and sometimes its OK-Inconsistency at the quality. the service is fast - its not a place that you can eat and chill out. it's a place where you have to eat fast and leave your seat/table for the next customer.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is a superb place to experience what locals in nicosia eat. Although there are many options which are based on meat, it is a great and tasty place for vegeterian as well.Food is tasty and it is authentic mediterranean (greek salad and aubergine creme are gorgeous)You can go small with a great option such as the politiko kebab (pita version) with lam or large with a platter for two which will fill you in full.There is also a very nice atmosphere close to the green buffer zone in Nicosia and service is friendly and fast",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Value for money food with excellent service and fast preparation of the food!!! Maybe the cheapest restaurant of the city considering the quality of the food.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Having been disappointed by bland, unappealing food at some other local restaurants, we were delighted to come across this lively restaurant packed with local people enjoying generous platters of food. We had the chicken platter which consisted of several different cuts of herbed chicken, including a sausage with vegetables, bread, grilled vegetables, huge portion of seasoned chips and two sauces. Everything was fresh, just off the grill and beautifully seasoned with herbs. Portions are huge - more than we could eat. They offered to box up the remainder for us to take home.The total cost of our lunch for two was ‚Ç¨23 which consisted of a huge chicken platter, bottle of mineral water and a carafe of red wine. We were given a complimentary dessert and a liquor. Much better value for money than we had elsewhere.The place is packed at peak times so you have to be patient if want to eat at the same time everyone else does i.e. 1pm for lunch. But relax and be patient, it is worth the wait.The restaurant is a bit hard to find, especially for English speakers as its name is not given in English. It is in a pedestrian street just opposite the Green Tree supermarket and its symbol is a pig with a blue bow tie.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"If you are hungry and don't want to bother with reservations then this is a great place, good service best value in town! Large portions served quickly in the heart of the old town! Worth the visit specially if you like meats!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Big portions, great taste and friendly environment. The waiters were very patient with my kids, always smiling. We ordered food for 6 people and paid 50 euros in total (beers included). We've been there 4 times and it never disappoints. The only difficulty is that there are no reservations. First come, first serve!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We have been hearing about these for AGES... and finally went to try it. WOW! Went on a Wednesday night... had to wait 15' to be seated. Service super friendly, very cheap food but very taste, great experience!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,A meat-eaters paradise. Succulent freshly-grilled meats (and veg) accompanied with a large variety of side dishes. My favourite... caramelised onions ... couldn't get enough of them. Great prices too.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very good prices and portion sizes, service was quick and food was delicious, especially the starters we had.Do bear in mind that the place is very popular so you may have to wait for 10-15 (standing up) before being given a table but a short stroll in the area, which has some beautiful old buildings, is a good way to pass the time.",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"Four of us tried to have lunch in this place on a Sunday. Arrived a little bit after 12.00. Doors were open and the tables both inside and outside were ready...plates, glasses, cutlery all set on the tables. Moved towards a table and tried to have a seat. Astonishingly, a guy comes from inside and says that the restaurant was not open yet and we couldn't sit!!! No problem buddy...we'll just move on to another place.. and so we did.This place is in a great location and looks nice (hence the second star I gave to it), but as far as I am concerned these people lack basic customer service skills. If it was my restaurant, I would just apologise to the customer for not being able to serve and ask if they would like to make a reservation and come back when the restaurant would open...none of that happened in our case.Oh well, plenty of nice restaurants around.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"We visited on a hot afternoon in August, I can remember that I was annoyed by the fly's around us, we ordered many small dishes but wasn't impressed, everything was to the bland side, service and prices were good",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,I visited the place many times always the quality of food is very good I highly recommended meat platter for two. Variety of meat in a reasonable prices in big portions,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great cheap and excellent quality. The concept is fast simple, great presentation with fantastic TLC from Costas the owner. Always fresh well presented food.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,I go once a month and every time its enjoyable experience .the only thing i dont like is that i have to wait 10 minutes to sit on the table.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Visited the restaurant a couple of days ago, tried the platters and all of them were delicious and complete! I would recommend the meat, chicken and vegetarian platter all of them nice served .",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Quite good food, missing that extra something but still very interesting at a great location and popular with people which gives it vitality. Recommended even if not a ""must"" when in Nicosia andnot traditional. It's actually a modern-traditional greek cuisine becoming popular lately",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Nice atmosphere, descent prices, very good food , excellent service! You need to go early, before 20:00 hours, as there is no reservation and is easier to find a table without waiting in the line. Very friendly atmosphere, try the platters for two.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Tasty food at good prices. Very popular so if you go there without reservation you may need to wait for a while until there is a table free. There are lots of tables however and service is fast, so you won't be waiting for a long time. Great position and really good food - if you enjoy grilled meat.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very good quality of food. Fantastc platters. Good location, friendly waiters. Value for money. The best restaurants at the old town of Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great location, very nice food, value for money and the service is just amazing. Very friendly very responsive. In general a very good experience",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"great location in the old town centre, great service and quality of food, tasteful platters with marinated chicken kebab, pork kebab and very reasonable price and nice desert at the end",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"What a Great place, fantastic food, good atmosphere, wonderful staff, highly recommend this restaurant, genuine Greek food cooked perfectly, the owner is very welcoming and attentive, the food came in good sized portions (in our case a chicken platter with additional pancetta and pork souvlaki and Greek salad followed by a complimentary dessert and liquor) - we will be back.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,A very crowded place and for a good reason. The restaurant serves large quantities of delicious Greek food for a relatively low price.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is a very nice family restaurant, food is great, service is very good and the prices are very good. Only issue is that it does get very crowded so be prepared to get their early or wait. But believe me it is worth the wait",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Food was excellent. Good quality and value. Very busy and a little hectic to order but other than that i would def.recommend. must try the chicken and meat platters.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,I visit this restaurant . It is very busy but the wait is worth it ....My only problem repeatedly is getting the sttention of the personnel either to give an order (or even more frustrating) getting to pay the bill .All in all though it is worth the experience ....,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We did not read all the very good reviews on this page but chose it randomly because it looked welcoming and was located in the quiet pedestrian zone of Nicosia. SInce we stayed in Cyprus for two weeks before coming here on our last evening, we have had enough of meat and fish and were happy to discover they had a vegetarian dish for two. We ordered it and really enjoyed the food (halloumi, a cyprus version of bruschetta and french fries). In the end we even got a delicious desert on the house. Even with a some drinks the bill was just 16‚Ç¨, so we can definitely recommend this very good and cheap restaurant.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This place have the best souvlaki always as is run by professionals.1.Owners run successfully other businesses for years. Reason maintaining always the standards.2.Chef lecturer and in the field for years.3.Manager in the market and knows all the customers even by name.So how can they go wrong,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Probably the best place to eat in old town Nicosia if you take into consideration the value/quality/cost balance this place has. Prices are very affordable and the food quality is excellent. Of course their specialty is greek kebab but most of the menu is worth a taste. Service is of high standards and if you are lucky you may also get a free sweet with your bill.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Normal pirces for a quite good food.Greek souvlaki might be the best option at this restaurant. Good desserts, friendly staff and nice place.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very good place! Atmosphere, prices, portions, service, evvvvveryyyythinnnng! :) Preferably to book a place before you go because it is usually crowded especially on weekends! :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Perhaps of the most beautiful restaurants of Nicosia with excellent Greek food at very good prices, The icing on the cake is the dessert to Cairns at the end.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"My type of place. Tasty food, big portions, and friendly staff. Big thank you for exceptional service for waiter George.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,This place is so popular that if you don't reserve you will have to wait to be seated. The prices are amazing and the food great. A nice place for family friends and couples.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We found this place on TripAdvisor before heading to Nicosia for a Saturday day trip - incidentally World Tourism Day. It is a seriously slick operation - they open at 12 noon for lunch on weekends and we arrived just before 1 pm.... by 1.30 pm it was full. Staff are friendly, helpful and on the ball. We had the vegetarian platter for 2 (12 euros), one chicken souvlaki (stick with meat) and one pork souvlaki - together 3 euros, a large tzatziki (2 euros), half a litre of house white wine (5 euros) and a litre of still water (1.80) - dessert and a local liqueur were included. A total of 23.80 euros for a fabulous lunch for two... with some to take home. This is an incredibly popular spot and we can't recommend it enough - food, service, ambience (even comfy chairs), open kitchen - a real experience.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Exceptional food with big variery of meat and cool drinks,very reasonable prices,good location and extremely helpfull staff!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We visited for lunch, food and prices excellent, fast service which was a good thing after a long day at the shops with my wife",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We came across this restaurant whilst walking along the small streets off Leda street and it looked a buzzing place. Best decision we made that weekend. Managed to get a seat outside and was quickly asked for our drinks order and given a menu. The staff were happy to assist with anything and to help with ordering. The food was fantastic and loved the way it was presented. We went for the platters, vergetarian and chicken. These platters are for two but believe me there was sufficient for more than two. Great night and will certainly be going back.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,good portions good choice of local fast food kebab style. but its always overcrowded and feels like you are in a bazaar. if you dont care about the noise and lines of people try it out.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We had a lovely lunch - Big variey for meat eaters and vegetarians - Staff very willing to help with food order and advise. Beautiful decor and ambiance. Ideal for light meal eaters or very hungry people,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Decided to dine here after reading the reviews. I have to agree that the place is crowed but they allocated us a table within 10 minutes. Food was good. We had selection of 3 dips ( individual portion was enough for 3!), Greek salad ( s portion), pita bread, potatoes with oregano and cheese and the souvlaki pork. All for less than ‚Ç¨18 including water. And liquor and dessert has been offered for free! All of this and the friendly staff made this place definitely worthy and I will recommend it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Was taken by the host of a local B&B i stayed at on recommendation. Max ordered and it as very impressive, the portions were huge and excellent value, The location was great as well",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"You have to be either lucky or go early to get a table. Once you get seated the food is very good, as well as the service and the prices. Been there many times and tried all sorts of dishes, which were all very good. It is located in down town Nicosia, in the pedestrian zone, so after a good meal there it is nice to walk around.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I was walking in Nicosia downtown searching for a place to eat and I have found this nice bistro.The place was very easy going and fast service. I had no idea what to have so I completely let the waitress decide and select for me. Her picks were amazing. The veal and lamb was fantastic. The food and atmosphere was very good.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Piatsa korounaki is a cool / funky restaurant located in the old town of Lefkosia near Ledra, the shopping district. It's s beautiful area.We ordered 2 platters and sides for the 8 of us, with beers. Eeeeeasily enough food - don't over order! I thought the quality was very good and it was excellent value. Probably the cheapest bill I've had for a long time! We thought the meat platter was better than the veg one, as you get roasted veg on the meat platter anyway.I hope Piatsa korounaki keep it low cost, quick and friendly, as it's a big part of the appeal. I'll definitely return.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"It is situated in the main street of the city center, we had to wait few minutes to seat but it was worth it. The portions were very huge and the presentation of the dishes was so nice!the crew was very efficent and kind... One of the best restaurant experiences!MOLTO BUONO :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Decent selection of Cypriot dishes. Usually always packed, with people queuing at peak hours. No surprises... A good selection of dips and appetisers. Best to come with friends so you can share.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"We went there thinking it would be open at 5 since it is in the middle of a tourist district. Nope...not open until 7. We walked around until it was open. Didn't know we had to check in and walked in to take a seat. Greeted promptly, service was quick.The place filled up quickly. I wasn't too impressed with the food. It is food that an American would have for lunch and not dinner. The vegetables would have been okay if they were seasoned. Meat was on the dry side. The cost is what I think draws a crowd. There was a line waiting to be seated. The crowd was mainly Cypriot so it may well be very close to Cypriot food. We want to try the Gyros on our next visit.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Eat and enjoy, you have to visit more than once to try it all and choose your favorites, lovely tasty food that will satisfy any appetite, go for it...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food at a great price. A great atmosphere as well. The one critique we have is that their fruit juice should be freshly squeezed. It was a bit jarring to get a small cardboard container of orange juice when we ordered it. Thankfully, it was returned with no issue and the great service continued.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Great place and good value for money! Good atmosphere and located in the old city as well! Worth a try! Try the cherry sweet as well for desert!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Ordered a platter for two, which costs 15 euros. What can I say...three people can comfortably eat from this platter, be satisfied with the quantity and some food may even be left over for a fourth person to eat.The food is delicious...the fries are fresh, the Greek salad is tasty and the meat is very nicely marinated and cooked to perfection.Excellent value for money, good customer service and a very good eat-out option for family, friends and even couples.HIGHLY recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"walking distance from the main shopping street (ledra). great place and service. we came for lunch and ordered a chicken platter. this had 3 types of chicken, fries, pitta, veg and sauces. it was really good and quite a lot for just two people.the place is nice inside with ac but many tables so not quite the ....romantic place... but if you go for a stop after shopping to get some great quality food than this is the place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Very nice and busy restaurant in the cosy Nicosia. We were with 6 Belgian ladies and the food was amazing. I asked a businesscard and i got the whole menu! he most expensive plate on the menu was a platter for 2 Souvlaki for 15.50eur (8.75‚Ç¨ pp) unbelievable but so true! And handsome waiters and cooks as well :) Go on like this Piatsa!!! perfect!!!!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I've been here several times. Staff is friendly and quick, food is great. Platters are rather big so thinks twice before ordering too much food. Don't be afraid of the long queue at the entrance - 20 meter line clears in less than 10 minutes!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"A very nice place to enjoy meat - provided you do not mind queueing up fo get a table !. The platters are the top pick - giving you a taste of their best dishes. Surprisingly low prices, and hope they keep it that way, seeing that it is one of the most popular shops in Nicosia-within-the-walls.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"a modern fast food, with an ok quality. good value for money. long waiting at the busy times as no reservations in advance.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Well if it happened to go for a walk in the old town of Nicosia, and you feel the need to eat, you can go to Piatsa Gourounaki. There is no need to make a reservation as they do not make any. So if you are lucky and there is a free table you can experience the best service and best taste of souvlaki in Nicosia. The food is perfect and the prices are very good. The decoration makes you feel that you are in a different century.The only negative thing that I found is that the place is too crowded when is full as the tables and chairs are to close to each other.The good food though makes you forget any negative things you find.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great place to eat! The chef really loves his job! Try the meat platter. It has a little bit of everything. Tasty food with great taste. Reservations cannot be made, but if you go early you won't be disappointed. Loved the decor ;-)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Fantastic platters, good quality food, quick service, lovely location - what to say, this place has it all.

40,"In the heart of nicosia, this restaurant/ tavern offers good quality food(mainly meat - Gourounaki means little pig!) in large portions. Their concept of meze i really enjoy and they also offer vegeterian dishes. It's not suitable for formal meals but its a great choice for a chill out night out and an enjoyable meal in a nice atmosphere. The only negative i can think of is that most times i visited the place is crowded and you need a reservation.",Piatsa Gourounaki
10,We were at the restaurant with family early so that we will get to be sitted. We were told that the policy of the shop was that they dont have table for so many people. So we left. But on a later stage while passing from this restaurant we saw that they were having people of 8 sitting.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"The food is very tasty and is more Greek oriented kebab house than Cypriot. The service is fast and polite. Great for friends and family. There is an excellent relation quantity - price.

50,"I have come here many times with friends and my wife and the food is always amazing. The wine is good value but you cant always guarantee it will be nice. You might have to wait to get a seat but for the price and the service you receive, the wait is well worth it.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is a nice restaurant in the heart of old town nicosia.The atmosphere is nice, the ambiance is correct and the service is very good.I visited twice, and although last time there what we ordered was a bit too junk, I think that was our fault.I like their sitting policy too, where first in is first sitted.Prices are reasonable ... i guess.I will definitely visit again and probably give it more stars.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Situated right in the heart of the old city you can get the best souvlaki ever! A must place to visit if you want to enjoy this Cypriot dish. Well cooked pork or chicken huge portions with chips and salad. Try the mustard sauce and tzantziki sauce, so tasty.The staff are polite and well trained the service is quick and by the time your order gets ready complimentary from the shop a plate with traditional rusks and olive oil sauce, and at the end of the meal free the pudding. Piatsa Gourounaki is the only shop in Nicosia in which you wait to be seated.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"great meat platters, famous souvlaki, selftalies and pork rips!!! value for money, great service, friendly stuff. Need to wait for a seating but worth it. Big portions, fresh. Also excellent are the chips and side servings",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I agree with the other reviewers, it's good meaty fare that's reasonably priced, in the heart of old Nicosia where the atmosphere is really buzzing these days.We ate there last night, a Sunday, and there were tourists queuing up with their guide books in their hands, to find a table. They finally found a table outside, which was where everybody wanted to be.Other nearby restaurants were empty, so obviously the word has caught on and people are happy eating here.Portions are large, common in Cyprus, and ingredients are good quality and well cooked. Service is friendly and prompt, would definitely go back.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"The best souvlaki place in the old city in Nicosia, very friendly personnel and value for money souvlaki. Ask for the graviera cheese in pastry and also the chicken souvlaki which is great.

50,"One of the best kept secrets of the old town in Nicosia. Located at the bottom of Onisagorou street (the one which runs parallel to Ledra Street). So much more than a souvlaki shop...the mixed platter which costs 15 euros is more than enough to feed 3 adults. Get there early, they do not take reservations, and after 8.30pm there is a queue of customers waiting to get in.. aircon indoors, fans outdoors...not to be missed",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"We visited last night the restaurant for the first time, the chicken was tender and well cooked, the variety of mix grill was also good, the service was good. The only bad part of our dinner was the managers attitude. He was rude and consistently ordering us from a far distance by shouting, into switching tables every minute without even saying please or even coming close to us.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,very nice restaurant.always fully booked. better arrive a bit before 8. must try the mixed grilled (meat). fully professional waiters. ice cold beer. quality meat.value for money,Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"If i could rate it more, i would. Best restaurant in Nicosia! Awesome chicken and potatoes! Nothing else to say.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"My wife and i have been there first time. We ate chicken plater for 2. But we didnt eat whole the meats. The taste of chicken was delicious and fresh. Waiters were very kind. The waiter brought dessert after paying check. We were suprised :). We were satisfied at the end of night. Price/quality is number 1. Chicken plater for two is 15‚Ç¨, small salad and 2 coke is 7‚Ç¨. We paid only 22‚Ç¨. The plater for 2 is enough for 3 person. Everyone should try",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This was my first visit to this restaurant we went there at 9 pm it was full booked with waiting list we waited for 10 minutes then we were sitted. We ordered meat plater for 2 ,1 small village salad and 1 picked peppers. The mix grill was so good and delicious it had pork n chicken kebab minced meat n chicken skewers and chicken wrapped in bacon also French fries. Service was quick and friendly. If I go to Nicosia I'll definitely go there again",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Great location in the old town. Food is good but not the best. At least is very consistent and it's great value for money. Takes no reservationsuch so be prepared to go early of wait for 20-30 minutes for a table. Very good service.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Big variety of Greek food served well. Good drinks, salads, service. Great value and location.Ttry to avoid peak times, always busy.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,Food was really nice and i am totally going again! the price range is also really good! i would totally recommend it,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,it is a nice place to visit for lunch or dinner!!! Probably the best value for money place downtown!! This is the reason that this place is always packed‚Ä¶ Unfortunately no reservations are made!! But is worth the wait! They say anything worth having is worth the wait!!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,I have been to Piatsa Gourounaki several times on several occasions and I was never disapointed of the food or the service. If you want to eat meet pork or chicken mostly this place makes it good and taste and when it comes the time to pay you don't regreat eating there. They make also vegetarian food which is my preference but is not that special as the platter they make with meet. Tasty though as well and pleanty enough to satisfy two people. I won't hesitate to going again and again whenever I will be in Nicosia Center.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"It is a nice place to visit for lunch or dinner in casual wear. The service is very quick and efficient. The food is very nice and also the prices are very good. This is the reason that this restaurant is always packed till very late and the people are waiting in queue to find a place here. Unfortunately, no reservations are made in advance.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Went there for dinner 4 people, food was great, service good, house wine drinkable and the bill reasonable. I can happily recommend this place to friends, but come early or there will be a wait as they don't take reservations and aren't now very popular in Nicosia!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We pass by this restaurant at night very often and it's always packed, with lots of people waiting to be seated, since they have a no reservations policy. Therefore, since my family wanted to visit it for dinner to celebrate my sister's birthday, we arrived there at 7:30 p.m. in order to find a spot. We were a large group (10 people in total) so two tables were quickly arranged outdoors by the staff to accommodate us.Our waiter was friendly and really patient with us (you know how big groups - and especially families - can be :p) and he took extra care of our order when we informed him that my cousin was extremely allergic to lactose.The cuisine is pure greek and there are plenty of dishes to choose from (meze, portions, vegetarian options). We ordered 2 platters, 3 main dishes, 1 side and 2 salads so we tried a significant percentage of the menu. All of them were very tasty, the meat was tender but at the end there was plenty of food left (maybe for 3 more people).The final bill was quite cheap - less than 9 euros per person - food and drinks included, even though the waiter could have suggested not to order so much food.In conclusion, the food was really good value-for-money, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was relaxing and pleasant. I strongly recommend it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"It's the best value for money place downtown, but it's pretty much always packed. You will enjoy the food, but it's not that extraordinary that it will deserve waiting a minimum of thirty minutes.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Piatsa Gourounaki is located on Onasagorou street in old Nicosia across the street from the historic Faneromeni church. No reservations are accepted so be there early to get a table since it's always busy. It's also a small restaurant but from Spring to Autumn you can also sit outside.Food is a combination European/Greek/Armenian and middle eastern. At least that is what the 2 platters we ordered tasted like! Food was plentiful and tasty. And on top of that, very-very reasonably priced!Clientele is usually young but you can also see older customers. Service was also excellent and there was a waiter always available!I definitely recommend this restaurant!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent place, Very nice and tidy place, very good food, good prices and very good value for money. Excellent service and very friendly stuff. Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Been there with our two four-yer-old children and had a very good time! Freshly made, great kebab with REAL potatoes and veggies. Quick service, which is very important when having children with you. Very good service, clean place, great tastes!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,The right place for a quick value for money lunch or dinner in the heart of Nicosia. The food is very good and the prices too.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Overall, very nice atmosphere, great tasting food and good service. The negative element is that no reservations are taken so you don't know if you are getting a spot as it is always very busy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food at great prices. Good service with polite waiters who greet you with a smile!!! Also, quick service so you will be eating in no time. Only downside is that there are no reservations which I would prefer",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,This collection recipes focuses exclusively on main courses cooked with meat. From slow-cooked lamb pork or chicken. Piatsa Gourounaki demonstrates once again how to create beautiful dishes using simple ingredients cooked with care and imagination.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,We went on a Sunday evening for early lunch. The staff was very helpful and the service was very good. The food - we had a combo- was also very good and in just 15 mins after we order was ready and very tasteful,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food,friendly atmosphere, very good service.The restaurant is located at the old town of Nicosia,near Faneromenis Church and number of coffebars",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Traditional, friendly, nice and clean.Quick service and delicious food.The menu is a bit small but everything in there is made with care(probably why they taste so good). It also has friendly prices.All in all, worth checking it out no matter if you are in Nicosia for vacation, all year, with friends, family or your soulmate.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Spotted this place on this forum. Was not disappointed - food was plentiful, freshly cooked and delicious. The bill surprised us as was such great value for money! Will return soon!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Recently visited Nicosia and this restaurant was recommended to us by a clerk in a shoe shop. She didn't stearin us wrong! The service was outstanding (thank you Christopher) and the food was delicious. You must try the chicken wrapped in bacon! Prices were so reasonable, that my wife thought the shocked look on my face was due to the expense! Quite the opposite! The prices are so reasonable and the food so plentiful, that we returned two days later with our daughter and three of her study abroad friends !",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Excellent food. Generous portions. Charming staff. A generous boss - He gave us a small carafe of red. You don't need me to tell you it's good. Just look at the place; it's always busy. And great value. Alive and throbbing. Go.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Are you hungry?? Do you need meat? There's no better place to experience Greek food! Tried many of their plates and on our last visit we ordered 3 meat platters for 7 people and we didn't manage to finish them! Amazing flavors and a nice variety is what you should expect when visiting Piatsa Gourounaki! Staff is polite and keep in mind that they don't take reservations so go early because the place is full almost every night!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,A perfect place to taste everything you want from the Cypriot cuisine! Seafood is fresh and delicious! You will love the atmosphere. The staff seemed not very friendly though. May be this concerns foreigners? I don't know. It was the first place in Cyprus without a smiling staff faces.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Piatsa is always rammed full, but don't worry, the waits for a table are more than worth it!The food is freshly-prepared, cheap, and delicious. Particularly the sausage, pork souvlaki and the chips. They are to die for.Great service; a reliably pleasurable experience no matter what time of year.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Amazing soublakia, xaloumi and salads..... definitely value for money and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a good place to eat in the centre of Nicosia",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Stroll through the historic alleyways close to the line, a true crossroads of ancient civilization, and eat at Pistsa Gourounaki. Traditional but with flair. Management are very present. Only eaten here once, but very good and way-reasonable price.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We stopped for a drink at this restaurant and were tempted to stay to eat when we saw the food coming out. We had a veggie platter, at ‚Ç¨12.50 this is extremely good value and everything tastes amazing. Just gorgeous food. The owner came out and spoke to us which was a nice touch. I can't recommend highly enough for tasty food at a very reasonable price.",Piatsa Gourounaki

50,"Excellent food,very good prices,perfect service.what else are you looking for when your hungry?Me nothing .This is my choise..",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"the food was good but service was excellent - friendly and fast, attentive but not obsequeous. Complementary dessert didn't hurt either. Very reasonable prices for genuine greek cuisine.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"A little hard to find since the name outside is in Greek letters. But once you locate the restaurant, it is worth the search. The servers never stop moving and they are charming. Simple, healthy delicious food served with love.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Been to this place a couple of times now, great food and great value for money, especially the platters! Love the salads here as well! Highly recommended, but be warned, you cannot make reservations and if you don't get there in time you'll definitely we waiting in a long line for a table!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Good food and prices. You would probably need to wait if you go there on a weekend. The souvlaki is nice and soft, marinated, and there are plenty of sides to go with it. Would have liked to beat more variety, like gyros, but everything we have tried so far is good, including the chicken kebab. Also the place is very noisy with a lot of people shouting all the time. Would overall suggest the place if you can find a table.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Been there at December! If you are at ledras street is a good solution. But you can find many restaurants there as well. food is good. At weekend is Always full people waiting there to take a table. Chicken Meze for 2 was great. Price excellent atmosphere great.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Everything was great food, environment, service, price but what the f... asking us all the time if we had finish with our diner since we were still eating!!! So rude!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The food is excellent every time you visit this place. Variety of platters to share. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. Value for money,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Highly recommended! Quality and affordability - friendly, helpful and humorous waiters, delicious food, excellent portion size! Warm outside seating, lovely location - just all round great really.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I am in Cyprus for a long time and this one is one of our favourites to have lunch or dinner, amazing staff and the good prices comparing to other cafes.Also like a waiter told us that in the evening if we want to get a place we should come before 8.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Nice little place! If you can get a table in the sun, get it! The meat platter for two is highly recommended - it will be a challenge to finish it between two people!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,It's the perfect place for a casual lunch or dinner and a pleasant way to finish or start up you day! Either with the family or friends you will enjoy the food! Nice Greek cuisine. We had our lunch on a high table and it was really comfortable. There are baby high chairs. Our waitress was really kind. I recommended this place! Definitely we will visit it again..,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I passed by many times and every time we saw people standing in line. Last week it was ""early"" for lunch but we were still hungry. So we came inside and it was not yet a lot people. Very kind waitress explained us about the portions and meat. We wanted something light and not too much, so we took 1 big kebap and and small chicken souvlaki and 1 small size salad,it was more than enough. Quick service,delicious and cheap.Recommended for everybody but I think is better if you come before 13h.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Normally for me it's not an aspect to mention but a place for good value for money. Much to my regret I had so many bad (really bad) experiences in Cyprus that this place was an oase against the others. I general terms it's heavy cuisine, in this genre the Serbo-Croatian is classes better. But let it be.... Maybe I have had to much expectations.Just on the side: forget the Turkish side of Nicosia culinarically. There is nothing to find to dine.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"All the platters are soo delicious pork and chicken, the prices are pretty much low the service is quick and gently, white wine is a good choise!!! I strongly recommend this restaurants to all of u!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We chose this place because we noticed residents who had lunch there. Completely filled in 3 p.m. Do not take reservations, but thanks to a very well-organized service quickly we were served. The food is excellent.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Strongly recommend this place. Very cost effective, outstanding service and yumi! Meat plate for two was delicious, most people around us also chose the same. Being frequent Cyprus visitor was ashamed that found this place so late. Avoid my mistake )",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We order meat and veggie platters, one salad and white bulk wine. We are six girls and we absolutely satisfied. Highly recommended and for sure ask for wine.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We were staying in Northern Cyprus and popped into South Nicosia for lunch on Easter Monday (another world from sleepy Northern Nicosia!). Have to say that this was the best meal we ate in the entire two week holiday.The place was buzzing at 12:30, completely packed, but despite this it looked so good from the outside, and we decided to wait. An efficient member of staff took our name, suggested it would be a 30 minute wait for six of us, so we had a walk around in the meantime. Fair queuing system and we were in.We shared two meat platters and one vegetarian platter, and a large Greek salad with three beers and a half litre of wine. The platters were massive - the meat ones consisting of marinated pork, chicken and lamb souvlaki, chicken wrapped in bacon, roasted vegetables, bread, sauces and a huge pile of chips sprinkled with oregano blossom. The vegetarian ones had the roasted veg with chips, salad, plus halloumi and a fantastic pepper/chilli/feta dip which I think is called mbougiournti. They served us quickly, did not rush us, asked if we liked everything and if not they would provide something else instead. We almost ate it all (but did not eat that night) and still took a doggy bag away. They gave us free pudding. All for sixty Euros. Thoroughly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Been to this place a couple of times now, great food and great value for money, especially the platters! Love the salads here as well! Highly recommended, but be warned, you cannot make reservations and if you don't get there in time you'll definitely we waiting in a long line for a table! (So many people can't be wrong!)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"While visiting Nicosia with our friends we were looking for a good place to have dinner with a nice atmosphere. We came across this wonderful restaurant where we could sit outside, thanks to the patio heaters. The staff were very helpful explaining the menu which was a bit different to any of the other Cypriot restaurants. The food exceeded our expectations as it was very reasonably priced. The four of us shared two meat platters for two and the food was amazing. The house red wine was very nice indeed and a desert on the house made our us think we had made a very wise choice to dine here. We intend to visit the historic town of Nicosia again very soon. and we are in no doubt we will be returning to the Piatza Gourounaki for dinner.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Good food at a reasonable price not very expensive with large portions and good quality meat. Tip for future customers: dont forget to make a reservation since it is mostly full.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We chose this restaurant after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. The food was good and the staff were friendly. The food came rather too quickly but maybe that was because we were there early as it became very busy around 8.30pm. As this was our first night in Nicosia we really don't have anywhere else to compare but we did think that we chose well and would recommend this restaurant.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We tried many times to enter, but the place is always packed, especially at night hours. We were lucky to have some spare time for lunch so we went today (31 March 2015).The place and food was everything friends described it. Very friendly and fast service, the portions were generous and value-for-money. We were 2 adults and a child and we ordered a meat platter (for 2), a traditional Greek salad (I have to comment on the very generous piece of fetta cheese) and a side dish of halloumi in pitta.The food arrived reasonable fast and the taste and quality were excellent. As for the portions, well, very generous. We have eaten similar food in other places in Nicosia, but nothing like it. The food was delicious and plenty. We even took home some food left. Finally, they offered us dessert (for 3 people), free of charge, an excellent panacota cream with wild cherry sauce. Fantastic way to end a lovely meal!Highly recommended, if of course you find availability! It is at the end of Onasagorou street (old town Nicosia), round the corner.Highly recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Placed in the heart of old Nicosia this cosy industrial designed restaurant offers great local food for very reasonable prices. My favourite is vegetarian platter which is meant to be for two but easily can satisfied three people. Also meat is very tasty and plentiful and reflect local cuisine. Highly recommended!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,One of the best combinations I've experianced in Europe with great price and great quality food. Next time I'm in Nicosia I'll stop by again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Probably one of the most attractive restaurants in Nicosia! The food is impressive both in presentation and looks, and the taste unforgettable! It is a unique restaurant in its nature. I would say a souvlakia 'boutique'. The dips, especially tyrokafteri is also worth a try if one likes spicy flavours! Would go back at every chance! The dessert which is on the house is also delicious!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very tasty, very friendly and nice design. We were two families and we ordered two platters. Very good prices.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,A very cheap and excellent quality restaurant that you can enjoy with friends and family Especially on a week end,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"below average food. what stroke me was the tyrokafteri (cheese dip) raw uncooked red peppers (it's not traditional they are cooked and they are green - a special sort actually) and its texture. when i ate it i had the sense that i was eating fat shortening as it was leaving a greasy waxy coating aftertaste on my tongue and mouth. i suspected it was blended with mayonnaise, hence its pearly appearance. no i asked the chef... they 'lighten' it with vegetable cream. two oxymorons vegetable cream and lightening, these are gross already tyrokafteri has no cream to lighten it. seriously? get back to cooking school. too loud crowd. the meat was ok. nothing special, service is ok but not enough to make me go back. too pricey for what they offer. sorry",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,The food is tasty and the salad good made with fresh vegetables. I recommend the meat platter as the quality is excellent and the quantity quite satisfactory. You cannot book in advance you just have to wait for your turn to be seated but we only waited for 15 minutes.It was a value for money meal and we will definitely visit it again.,Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Basic tastey food grilled meat, chips with cheese, olives, dips etc, similar in preparation and taste to what you would find in Athens. Very good value for money. Always very busy and because of this expect to wait for a table if you're just passing by. 2.50 a pint of Keo as well, which is hard to come by anywhere in Nicosia!",Piatsa Gourounaki
10,"Like many trendy places in Nicosia, Piatsa Gourounaki can be surprisingly busy, which in its turn, adds to the entire frustrating experience. No reservation can be made and, particularly on weekends, you are likely to have to wait a good 20-30 minutes before you are seated. And then, you are given a table that is right in the path of running waiters who rush like madmen to serve food in a crowded, noisy and smoky/smelly environment. And then, the food comes. Greasy, poor quality food that I would have expected to be served from a street hot-dog vendor. The difference is that they charge you much (much) more though. What a disappointment! Looking at how busy this place was, I thought to myself ""it must be worth trying"". It was not. I have been there three times. One on my own and I was also dragged there by some friends twice. Apart from not wanting to be rude, I wanted to give this place a second chance. It was not worth it. Being in the old part of Nicosia, right next to several historical buildings, make the place somewhat attractive. Unfortunately, I cannot find a single reason that would make me say something similar for my stomach. The food was an insult to my digestion system. Go there in the summer then, seat outside and have a beer...",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Good food, affordable prices. You can select from a small meal (ie one souvlaki skewer) in a greek pitta bread with some salad, maybe add potatoes, or choose a mixed grilled platter to share, along a salad and some dips.I found prices to be fairly competitive when compared to the cypriot food market.Service was a little slow, but to be fair i visited 2-3 times when they first opened, and they compensated in manners and a friendly approach.I vsited both for lunch and dinner, and sat outside every time.If you are in the area and get hungry, I recommend checking it out.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This restaurant is great for a casual dinner, the prices are affordable and the quality of food is excellent. Definitely recommend the meat platter! Arrive early though as the restaurant gets busy very quickly.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Although there is a big sitting area inside and outside do not expect restaurant quality food. Good for casual night outside with frends. Have a nice walk around the old Nicosia city center and at the end of it, have a sit at Piatsa Gourounaki order a plate to share and have some beers. Don't expect to walk much more after that!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Amazing find , so glad we ate here. Quantity and quality is matched to meet your expectations from all quarters. Chicken souvlaki is a must to have. The wine so good and all at a great price. The complementary dessert mehalbi was such a sweet gesture. Leaving with our stomach full and satisfied appetite",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Delicious Food,good prices.Definetely coming back. Only thing its always packed so you have to go there early. We were here twice. The first time we ate inside. The service was excellent but the second time we had our dinner outside (because it was packed) but the service was average. We got neglected a lot and the waiter could have been a little more polite. I get it that because of the pressure of the job you can't please everybody but still you need to have your way with your customers.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We arrived in the restaurant few minutes after opening time, but many of the tables were already occupied. We soon understood why - this proved to be the best restaurant experience we ever had in Cyprus. Traditional food, but with an exciting twist. Considering the quality of the food, the friendly waiters and the good ambience, value for money was excellent!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent service, friendly stuff, delicious food and in affordable prices. Located downtown it's difficult to find a parking place. Note that it doesn't accept reservations",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"After being told that this is the best souvlaki in town and being a fun of greek foodi decided to visit with some friends on a weekday for lunch, we were seated promptly andserved fast as we told them we were on a lunch break. These are the positive notes, on the other hand greek souvlaki was a bit too ''marinated'' for our liking since you couldnt get the real taste that souvlaki should have. I have had better but then again i have had worse too...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This feels like really authentic Greek fast food, wonderful! It was really busy and we sat outside under heaters, just warm enough on a very cold Feb evening. Service was excellent, fast and attentive and as I don't eat meat I had a selection of the tasty veggie side dishes while my husband had an excellent souvlakia. The waiters did their best to translate the menu for us! Food was excellent and we shared a complimentary pud and also free mastica.Vibrant atmosphere and excellent value.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I LOVE this restaurant. From the location, to the services, to the flavours, the quality of food, and the unbeatable prices. I never leave unsatisfied. Their local wine is excellent too. Uncharacteristic of restaurants in Cyprus, Piatsa Grourounakia does not take reservations; which can be a good thing or bad thing. Suffice to say, there is ALWAYS a long line to be seated.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"we ate there yesterday at lunch time, the food was really delicious,the dishes generous in size, the staff helpfull and kind. It was really a good surprise for us because we arrived there by chance due to a recomandation we got from a nice Irish seller from a shop nearby...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Piatsa is a great place for a reasonably priced meal in the Ledra Street area of Old Town Nicosia. We arrived at Piatsa just after it opened and it filled up very quickly. We ordered Chicken Souvlaki and a Greek Salad. The food was very tasty, well prepared, and the service was great. The portion was much larger than expected and very filling. Some other diners near us ordered the Platter for Two and it looked great but there again a large portion.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Good food (do not expect haute cuisine), great service, kind & hard-working staff. You have to wait a little bit in order to find a table during peak hours.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"On a 4 day trip to Nicosia, my husband and I ate here 3 times. The staff were so friendly and the food was delicious. It's great for lunch but it really comes alive in the evening. Would definitely recommend!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"the food was very good and tasty. the service was excellent, staff members were smart and friendly. i will visit again!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,The food was tasty and plentyful and the price is definitely right. The service was excellent. The place is very popular and we will definitely come back.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Piatsa Gourtounaki is located in Onasagorou str next to Faneromenis church. The food is quite good, service is excellent and prices are reasonable.The only problem with this restaurant is that it gets really busy almost every night (and day during lunch). Reservations are not accepted so you might need to wait a little bit before you are seated.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Œùot bad. Although it is almost overcrowded service is very good, staff members were very friendly with us. Adequate food quality.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I stayed at this animated terrace in the winter and enjoyed good local food and atmosphere. The sauces to eat with the meat were very good, and they had fantastic wheat beer. There was also an indoor local full of people. Prices OK.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"On the upside is that this is a walk in place. The place is strategically located behind Faneromeni so it is always busy with non jihadist tourists as it serves pork beer and wine amongst other things.A large local crowd always makes its way there, especially those from the countryside that come to Nicosia to walk around and see people (instead of their flock).I suppose that if you want to eat a cheap dinner or lunch and would not like to spoil your health you dan go tehre as it is a clean place and has a good live atmosphere even if all you hear is munching.Not a place to propose or celebrate the new promotion, but worth the visit if you are with your family and are tired of kids nagging!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Large place with cool atmosphere. Easy access to parking places down town. 2-5 minutes walking distance to the restaurant.Excellent service! The people working at piatsa gourounaki are very pleasant and polite.Great food! Very tasty, satisfactory portions. Loved the desert!!!The owner paid us a visit just to make sure that everything was ok.Cost per person is low.Another visit to piatsa gourounaki is scheduled already.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Love the food, especially the chicken souvlaki, the atmosphere is great. Central location, but poorly access to parking spots.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Very good atmosphere in the heart of the pedestrian road in the old town with tasty greek souvlaki and delicious portions. Try it and you will love it!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Be sure you'll enjoy it.fantastic design.great atmosphere.the great team working hard to satisfied all customers.you don't need to book a table.as soon you entries is wait you a nice charm boy who will find you a table make you feel comfortable.the boss there is helping to the crew and makes sure all orders goes on time.that what I call team work,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"What a great place! A short menu in Greek and English, with choices of meals at different sizes; the first time I went here I thought at those prices the portions must be tiny, but no - The large chicken plate at around 8 euros was way too much for me. Recently returned and got the medium pitta and it was perfect - very juicy chicken, chips in the pitta Greek style. My partner got the yogurt lamb and veal which was also delicious. Half a litre of perfectly nice wine at 5 euros was also great value. It's always very busy, although we've always managed to get a table (in summer there are more tables outside too), sometimes the service can be a bit slow at first, but the food and drink comes out fast after ordering and the staff are very friendly, the waiter even gave us a couple of free glasses of wine while we were paying the bill (under 25 euros for 2!).",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Greek style souvlaki and pita, kebabs, salads. Good food at reasonable prices. Nice service. Poor wine list.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food, very friendly staff, fast service and lovely chef! Try it and see for yourself how fantastic this place is. Be ready to wait a bit for a table, but it is definitely worth waiting!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great value for money place, loved the food but mostly the fact that after 12 minutes of ordering the food was at our table.The quality, quantity, presentation and mostly price (we paid around 30 Euros for 4 persons including drinks, they did not charge for the kid's portion we ordered!)- of the food are all very good- will most definitely visit again soon.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Gourounaki is the least pretentious eatery in Cyprus.The only place we have ever seen queues.It's simple Greek cafe atmosphere well suited to its situation and ones expectations, and yet it's very stylish, service is superb but not intimidating, food presentation and quality excellent, tasty and sooooo very inexpensive, we love going there and feeling we could be anywhere else but Cyprus. It has to be one of the most popular eateries as it's always packed.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"If it's clean and tasty souvlaki (pork, chicken or lamb) you're after, this is the BEST place right now in Nicosia. The food is great, the service very good and it's located in center of Nicosia. The only maybe disadvantage to this restaurant is the environment which is not really inspiring and brings to mind a fast-food restaurant rather than a decent restaurant which the quality of the food suggests.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"I can highly recommend this restaurant: it is cheap, service is great, plates are enourmous and filled with really fresh food, interior is very nice - modern and local at the same time",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Very delicious souvlaki at the most popular restaurant of the old town. You are lucky if you find a table! We all, especially the kids (teanagers) enjoyed our dinner pork and chicken souvlaki very well marinated , salads and vegetables. Excellent prices, perfect for a big family like ours! It will be our family out place!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Previous time we have tried their lamb kebab which we didnt like. This time we have tried their pork souvlaki and chicken souvlaki plates. Both were GREAT!! Fresh and good quality meat, rightly cooked and very tasty marinate! Their marinate was so great that it was one of the first times that i didnt put any extra salt, pepper or lemon on the meat! Their prices are very good also! Instead of fries we ordered grilled vegetables (red and yellow bell peppers, zucchini and aubergine) which were great also! Definitely one of the best souvlaki you can have! Strongly recommended!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"food was great, highly recommend-had a meal with lamb and traditional local sauces/salad; pita bread",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,The place is very popular judged from the crowd waiting for a table. But they will not wait long - the restaurant has an efficient concept with few options from the Menu Card. We had like almost all others the meat plate with some spicy sauces - very good!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"So... Piatsa Gourounaki is the new in place for souvlaki in Nicosia. Located in central Nicosia, always occupied by good people. Value for money. I tried the chicken platter for two and totally loved it! There was this yellow-yolk coloured sauce that is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC with both pork and chicken! The village greek salad with cucumber, feta cheese,onions, tomato and caper seeds was a very nice starter! Totally recommended and very flabbergasting pocket-wise.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Piatsa Gourounaki is located in a very good location close to Ledras street. Food is good and prices are good as well. Shared plates are very very good in quantity. The only disadvantage is that tables are very closed and you are almost in the same table with the others. There is no enough space to eat and talk with your partner. However, In general is a good choice for food.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We had the chicken platter for 2 and it was delicious and well cooked.It is easy to overcook the chicken meat and other meat dishes but Piatsa Gourounaki managed to get it beyond right. The chicken meat dish was lovely, tender and juicy (the sort of juiciness that can only be achieved if not over cooked). We could also taste the charcoal grilled goodness, like how a good grill should taste like, with just the right smokiness but no charred taste. The platter for 2 was good value at only around EUR18. There was so much food we couldn't finish all of it.This should be quite a popular restaurant as within 10mins of its opening in the low season of winter, the place was almost full.If you're looking for a place to have lunch/dinner around Ledra St, look no further!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Recommended by a Cypriot friend as a 'kebab house' I was a bit apprehensive as kebabs are not usually on my menu.At 10pm on a very wet Nicosia evening we decided to give it a try. First impression was that the place was busy, most of the clientele being younger locals. That's usually a good pointer. The menu was bilingual (Greek & English) which made things a bit simpler for one who struggles sometimes even with the English language. We chose the ""Chicken Platter for Two"" at a massive ! Eu15.50 along with 1/2 litre of ""barrel"" wine at Eu5. The platter included souvlakia, various chicken pieces, chipped potatoes, and a selection of veg. Superb all round ! and the wine was as good or better than most I have sampled in more expensive joints !.I nearly forgot to add that the service was friendly and fun and the chef managed to visit every table, at least around us, to check that the food was up to scratch.Our meal cost a total off Eu20.50 and the chef kindly let us try one of his sweet creations gratis.On any future visit to Lefkosia I will head to this establishment without hesitation.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"One of the best places to have souvlakia in Cyprus!! And it is in the heart of the city, with very good prices.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Went today with our two kids. Packed but they fit us in within five mins. Great tender meat and chicken and extremely reasonable. Loved everything about it!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Had 0.5 kg of lamp chops (1 portion!) excellent cook, taste, presentation. Fries were fresh and salad full of flavour. My spouse got an A***** chicken kebab that totally beat averything else I have tried so far! Definitely recommend",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,The food is delicious and the prices very low. I think it is the best restaurant ion the area for souvlaki. I totally recommend it!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,If u want good greek kebab in old Nicosia this is the place. Big space with good design and very reasonable prices.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"they open on the minute, before no seating, no reservation, but have hour later full. So take care.nice location in the walking zone, and great outdoor seating. We ordered several meze which we shared and later a big portion of meat, beef , duck, chicken and all was very fine. had also some nice wine and some beers before.food was really good, and nicely served, waiters performed well,so perfect evening.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"The food was really good and good value for money as well. A great place for a casual outing with friends.Service was very friendly and our waiter was very patient and willing to help with the menu. Not that you need much help, as everything is great.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent service, tasty food in satisfied amount and in very low prices. If you haven't visited it yet do so the soonest!! Loved it!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Tasty greek dishes! Good home wine! Quick service! Machallepi for dessert! We were 4 and the bill was 48 euro for food (meat platter, salads) and drinks (wine, beer, oyzo). Perfect place and yummy food!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"While wondering around the backstreets of Nicosia near the main mall at Ledra Street, a group of six of us stumbled across Piatsa Gourounaki Restaurant. It was quite busy but our waiter quickly made room for us, provided menus and enough time to select our meat platters and salads. He also adviser us not to order too much as the servings are plentiful - which I really appreciate. The food came out quickly, it was hot and as our waiter suggested - PLENTIFUL! To top things off, it was very nice food, beautifully cooked and the best value for money I have found if Cyprus. Highly recommended and I will be going back! Loved it! (Look for the Black Pig with a red bow tie!)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Brilliant service, great food, and what value for money, and to top it off a simple, tasty, traditional dessert on the house.The food is simple, quality, cooked and served with love and the prices are great value.It's not difficult to run a good restaurant but so many make a hash of it, they could learn a lot from this place.A great meal, thank you, definitely a return visit.Reviews are fine but the best way is try it for yourself.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I love this place, all the food is fresh, tasty and very traditional. They cook with love. Try it...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"One of my favorite restaurants in the south , very generous portions , spotlessly clean , Friendly staff , great location and prices",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Provided you don't have to queue up, Piatsa is an ideal fast-food option in the old town of Nicosia. The food is good and the price is by far the most reasonable I have paid for this type of food in Nicosia. Recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Fabulous food, fantastic value and extremely good service! Come here to eat if you can, if we were staying longer we would be back!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Just great food and very nice staff :) The atmosphere is AMAZING If u r hungry in Nikosia- this is the place to be :),Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"I've been here twice before, firstly with my Father upon arrival in Nicosia, then more recently with a group of 7 of us. I can't fault a thing! Brilliant service, great food, and great value for money!This time, we were a large group - total of 14 - and stupidly we had not booked ahead, or phoned up prior to our arrival despite it being a meal for a birthday. We knew it would be difficult, especially because I knew how busy this place can be!The man we spoke to was incredibly accommodating, and after a few minutes, and a quick reshuffle of the table plan, they managed to fit all 14 of us. We ordered 7 of the sharing platters, and a few of the salads for the table. Again, wonderful service, great food - and as a meat-lover I was absolutely in my element. Extremely tasty. We spoke with both the chef, and the host at some length and it was lovely to have a conversation with them.The food is delicious. The prices are great value for money. The service is a credit to the restaurant. The overall friendliness and willingness to help us out was just brilliant.So many thanks for helping us out! It was a great meal, and the birthday guy had a really good night! So thank you very much! Definitely have a return visit.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Piatsa gourounaki serves excellent food in good prices and large portions. Me and my girlfriend had the mix grill which was more than enough for the two of us. The only thing I didn't like was the grilled vegetables but with all the meat and the fries it wasn't something to care mulch. The service was excellent and right their when needed.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We spent 2 nights in Nicosia (from Paphos). We had no idea where to eat and walked past this restaurant in the afternoon. Arrived back after 7pm and it was soon full with people standing in the street waiting for a table. (We knew we had come to the right place). The staff were friendly and helpful. Food was great and portions we had were very good. The chef came out to talk to some of the customers, he was great fun and very friendly. We ended up with some complimentary wine. (Thanks Chef!).",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very good grill restaurant, the staff was fun & friendly. A good international vibe in the centre of the old city. Another plus was the great value for the food. So if your in the old city and want a bite and drink you should definitely check this place",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Had a great meal here after a walk across the border (which is nearby). Aperitifs in the Buyuk Han and then pop back across the checkpoint for a delicious meal here. We got there at about 7.15pm and it was fairly empty but within half an hour all the outside tables were taken. Our waiter suggested we had ordered too much (we are a mature couple but with decent appetites) and even after he had changed some of the large dishes to small, we still couldn't finish everything! Wine is available in carafes and is perfectly acceptable. We had a chat with the owner and he obviously has a passion for food and ensuring everything is I'm place for his customers to have a great time. A slap up meal with half a dozen starters, loads of meat and carafes of wine cost a very reasonable ‚Ç¨28! The best meal and atmosphere of any restaurant we tried in Nicosia.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Its a very good restaurant in the heart of nicosia. Good food in a very good prices. The menu have choices of meat platters.the souvlaki is very good.drinks are in logic prices instead of other nicosias restaurant. It worth to visit it.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We heared very good comments for this place! That is cheap and with very good food. So we tried it! We sat insight and the place is nice decorated! We ordered the yaourtlou kebab and their politiko kebab but it wasn't so great. Mine was almost raw and pink from insight. But the portions were huge and the salad etc was very good! Their beer and drinks are in good prices also! We are going to try it again but this time we will try their souvlaki...,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,A super vibe at this corner location - perfect place to enjoy an evening out. Great that it was walking distance from our hotel. Although the place was packed we were never rushed or felt service was below par. At 15e the shared meat platter was plenty and tasty enough and the barrel wine was decent.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Wow! What a find! We found this place by accident and it was our best meal in Cyprus! You get a top of line feast of beautifully bbqed and marinated meats, with hand cut fries, fresh breads and grilled vegetables all for under 15 euro! and 2.50 for the freshest greek salad in Greece! Really modern, clean and classy with super friendly staff. They even gave us a free traditional greek homemade desert which tasted like fresh flowers. Find this place - seriously!",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"First friend of 5 arrived at 8:30 to get some space while the rest of us struggled to find parking in the area. That of course has nothing to do with the restaurant.. We got a square teble for 4although there would be 5 of us.. They got the order very quickly and the food was on table within 10 minutes .. Cost was very low compared with quality of food... The only thing i would change would be the awkward entrance on the side , the noisy inside room tables and the annoying smoke from the barbecues.. And of course that its in Cyprus and has fans and not an air-condition inside ...",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"There's been a lot of hype about Greek souvlaki lately hitting the shores of Cyprus. So far, none manage to capture the real Greek tasty souvlaki (try in Athens, if there, ŒõŒµŒπŒ≤Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒ±, who has been there, off plateia Omonoias over 40yrs as I recall). Coming back to this restaurant, apart from the below average food, the staff is totally unprofessional, and totally inattentive. Learn how to treat people, before even dreaming of serving food, and, people. Again, people's food standards back home must be very very low.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Absolutely love the food here, its Greek cuisine at its bests. Platters to share (for two people) are a good choice. Its crowded but there is a reason for it.. Its low prices!! It does not have reservations so be there in time if you don't want to wait long.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Was a bit unsure when we walked pasted as the restaurant was packed with locals. Was made very welcome, friendly staff and quick service. Staff explained what dishes where, not rushed at all. Food excellent. We chose the meat platter dish which consisted of various meats cooked in different ways. This came on a big tray accompanied with roasted vegetables and chips.Excellent. This is situated not far from the buffer zone in nicosia down one of the back streets. You can't miss it because its the one that is always full. Very good prices. Go and enjoy.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,For the people who wants to go with their family it's a nice place friendly for children ! Normal to low prices to eat nice food quickly and tasty . We go often with my family and friends! service is always very good even if it's fool of people with nice wine ! surely recommend !!,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Quality of food was Ok.the portions though could be larger.for instance tzatziki portion size has nothing to do with tzatziki portions served in any Greek island even Athens. Imported beer even though shown in low price in their catalogue there was not in stock. Generally it was Ok.,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"I visited this place after being recommended by a friend - we were nearby so we thought we would try it.The 3 of us were very disappointed.When you order, the people serving are trying to push extra things that you do not order - I understand that they try this, but this was WAY over-the-top. They even had the cheek to question why the 3 of us were ""only"" ordering water and sparkling water to drink and not having a ""drink"" - as if they had the right to tell us what to drink!!!!The food was decidedly average to say the least - there was no ""WOW Factor"" in the food and everything and I mean EVERYTHING was covered in so much oregano (rigani) that it masked the tasted of the food - all you could taste was the herb. When something has so many spices on it you have to question the quality of the meat that they use.What we ordered was definitely not on the board in quantity - if it was, then the portions are VERY SMALL.This place is a glorified souvlaki place with a Greek atmosphere. It would have been a great place to visit in old Nicosia if the food was good and the prices were reasonable compared to the portions that you receive.Mediocre quality food, small portions and expensive - added to the ""don't visit again list""",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,We visited this place for the first time a month ago and we have already been there three times.We love the authentic souvlaki they serve and the atmosphere is pleasant too.Prices are good too and the staff are quite friendly.Just make sure you sit near a fan if its humid that night coz it gets stuffy some nights.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Amazing food, nice variety of chicken souvlaki and nice cozy environment in the heart of ledras street.i highly recommend it for a lunch because in the night its difficult to find a table",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,I visit Piatsa Gourounaki twice a week-A real laid back authentic souvlaki with exceptional food in a beautiful little square in old town. If you come across the place please take your time and try their dishes-Excellent customer service as well üòâüëç,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We've been here twice in two weeks and the food if fantastic, especially for the price. Establishments like this, good food, good price, good service, is what the old town needs to really create an identify for itself. Another reviewer called this a ""Fast Food"" establishment, however, this is mis-leading as the food is served quickly but its not fast food in the McD's of KFC vein. The food is good and grilled and therefore much healthier. A draft pint is 2.5 Euro. That's 50% less than the establishments which have been ripping off people for years. Bravo Piatsa Gourounaki!",Piatsa Gourounaki
20,"Went there with another couple to sit in once. Nice atmosphere and place, don't forget it's just a souvlaki restaurant.Service was ok. We were 4 people so we decided since we didn't know the specialities to order 2 plates of different meat serving (2 merides diafora). The quantity of the food for 4 people was very little, the the meat itself was terrible. Too too too soft !!!! Don't hurry to say ""that's the way it should be cooked"" cos i'm not referring to the kind of softness you get when the meat is cooked fine. ( I'm barbequeing for my family souvlaki and other meat products for years now and believe me i know when the meat has soda or other meat softener products on it.... ).Finally the place is expensive although passing by may seem as a place of average pricing.Never went there again. I wouldn't suggest it at all.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,I have visited the place with a friend for dinner. Its a place where you can have lunch or dinner fast and with good prices. I must admit that for a 'fast food' place the quality was very good. Its constantly over crowded but the staff is friendly and always try to arrange a place in 5-15 min.,Piatsa Gourounaki
40,Although we went to Piatsa Gourounaki on a weekday it was almost full and we were very lucky to find a table to sit. We have ordered different types of souvlaki and kebab and everything was very nice. The staff is very polite and eager to serve. The pricing is very good as well.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Fantastic meal for a cheap price with an amazing atmosphere. In what concerns the staff: 5 stars!!! Had lots of fun! !!,Piatsa Gourounaki
20,The food is like a plastic and is very small portion i eat kebab and is not good my other friends eat many dishes and all is the same very poor but the price is very cheap,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This restourant has the greatest atmosphere and also very good food for reasonable price,Stuff was friendli, polite.Everything was great.No reservations needed. It is casual restoraunt for hang out and eat something. Bad thing is that in same time is so crowdy that you feel you need to move cause the others(they should eat too :) Really good choice and in the center of the city.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"my wife, brother and step-son chanced about this restaurant in a walk about around nicosia. we shared a meat and vegetarian meze which was enormous and very tasty. The setting was industrial / rustic with blond wood tables. We foolishly accepted the waiter's suggestion of another salad which we could not manage (did not touch) but having chatted to the owner/ patron chef everything was packaged up to take away and we were given a complimentary dessert - the obligatory milk pudding, which was too flowery for all of our liking.The food was both well presented, tasty and of generous portions and served with grace.Food together with beers, wine, pop and water - we left feeling too full it must be said - but that was a warning to not over order..totalled 63 Euros.We were impressed by it all and it was in the heart of Nicosia just off of Ledra street.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Apparently, its owner(s) have invested a lot in this restaurant and i m not only talking about money... Their idea of opening a greek-style kebab restaurant in the heart of town was certainly an original idea. The food is delicious and the service is great. The price is cheap but no discounts were made ovver quality! It accepts no reservations but when the restaurant is full the waiting is not that bad (5 min) and it is surely well worth it. Well done guys!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Excellent food, excellent service very polite, fast and professional, very good price (local beer pint 2.50‚Ç¨). The environment is great, everything is well presented, simple and nice decoration with wood and black details in a great location in the old town. Plus the dessert is offered most of the times. One of our favourite places to eat!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Great food, amazing prices! A salad for only ‚Ç¨2.50! Good range of dishes and more than sufficient range.. Will definitely be back!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Went with my husband and son 3 weeks ago. The food was very tasty and everything was so nicely presented! It's the good old souvlaki we know but with a modern twist, a nice sauce, or a side dish with cheese etc!The food came fast and the waiters were friendly and polite.The best thing was the bill!! Very good value for money.The only thing that could be done better is reservations. It's a bit of a mess because a group of 5 people could occupy a table for 10 people just because they got there first and that's not good planning in my opinion. The place it's always packed though! I guess it's a matter of luck or going there VERY early! Like 12 for lunch and 7 for dinner.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"A great find, lots of meat, the platter is very good, the staff very friendly, had a great meal, I had the lamb chops, husband had the meat platter, would recommend.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is a very unique concept. Very innovative and creative. Great location between Phaneromeni and Onasagorou street in the old city of Nicosia. Instead of going with the traditional, simple kebab house with zero atmosphere/ambiance, they went with a very tasteful design and more creative kebab dishes. I happen to know one of the owners personally (CA), and I am not at all surprised with the outcome. Food is somewhere between Greek kalamaki, Cypriot ‚Äúsouvlaki‚Äù and Turkish kebab with good value for money. The highlight (and the best sellers I would imagine), are the platters to share. In general, Piatsa Gourounaki is an easy-going, friendly and at the same time buzzing place that reminds me of a traditional Athens local hang out. Great value for money",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"The service is excellent and the design very simple and nice. Went there after friends suggestions, I really love Poli's kitchen and they do it right. We had to wait for about 15', it was ok cause the food was nice. Not everything we ordered was so good (ie politiko arnisio souvlaki wasn't that tasty) but all the atmosphere was friendly :)",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,After arriving in Cyprus on a late afternoon flight this was the perfect answer.The food was flavourful and well seasoned. The staff were welcoming and friendly and offered great value for money.A must do for any trip to Nicosia.I will be dreaming of the food for many months to come and just wish there was one in London.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"On a business trip to Nicosia from london, a friend recommended this place, absolutely fantastic. Great 'tapas' style fresh grilled food set in the old town of Nicosia. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and service. I believe it's only been open for a few months but it's a must stop if you visit the old town. I had a selection from the grill and a mix of salad which was plentiful and full of incredible tastes. No bookings but very busy, if you have to wait for a table, seriously wait!!!! It's worth it. Best authentic Cypriot restaurant I'm come across in Cyprus. Highly recommended.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We stopped by late afternoon and enjoyed the meat meze sharer, the portions were very generous, succulent and tender meat, we even returned later that evening for drinks!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"We tried three times while passing by to finally get a table at this place. We had a table outside. First contact with the menu you realise that is really cheap and this can be the reason is always packed. After the food came (I had chicken souvlaki) I enjoyed it! Delicious souvlaki! Dish accompanied with greek pitta and fried onions and potatoes and salad. Hmmm... I wish this doesn't end up in the end like certain unhealthy places you find in Athens that you go for souvlaki and it's like going for junk food. For the moment is very good I will be returning back. The only thing I didn't like was that as they don't accept reservations people queue among the rest seated guests outside to get a table. In the end you end up eating, while just next to you people queue and discuss with the supervisor (sometimes people get frustrated) for the next available table. This is certainly not nice as apart from the good food a restaurant (even a casual one) needs to keep an order and respect their customers. They could have the people queueing, if this is the policy they want to keep, a bit further than having people standing among the tables discussing while the rest are eating. Returning back yes. I recommend it!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This is a really buzzy restaurant. It is quite small inside but with a lot more seating out on the pavement. It's in a pedestrianised area so there is no traffic problem. The food was very good, especially the various grilled/barbecued meats. Service was good too. Worth a visit.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,Our new favorite place in old Nicosia. Only drawdown is that they don't accept reservations so you need to wait to get a table.,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Grill specialist, food is excellent. Try the platters, they are value for money and can fill 2 persons more than adequately. Prepare to wait to be seated as it's almost always full and does not take reservations.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This greek style restaurant is doing something right. Their meat is tasteful and soft and their price is excellent. They don't accept reservations which is a shame because you might wait their for 30mins for a table. Other than that is a great place for a souvlaki, fresh french fries and nice music.",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"Very good food ... excellent service ... friendly staff ... good prices ....the only problem is that they do not take reservations and in case they are full, you must wait from 10 to 45 minutes or even more .... otherwise is an excellent choice when you visit downtown Nicosia ...",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,totally recommend it! especially the combo for 2! amazing variety of chicken and the service was fair! totally a place to go!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,My boyfriend and I went there last night after a walk at the streets ledras and onasagorou! It was great! The staff was welcoming and the food delicious! We ordered the chicken variety for 2 and it was more than enough and delicious! Totally recommend it to everyone!,Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"So fun! Excellent meat , great atmosphere, huge dishes, lovely waiters. Highly recommended ! ...................................",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This new souvlakeri Piatsa Gourounaki as is called, is located at the centre of Nicosia old town, next to Panayia Phaneromeni church, by Ledras and Onasagorou pedestrian streets. Modern decor, a little noisy, very clean, outdoor sitting for smokers,very good and quick service and very reasonable prices, especially for drinks. The plate we ordered was for two and was consisted of pork and chicken souvlaki, chicken souvlaki wrapped in bacon, politiko pork kebab, chicken kebab with sweet papers,tasty vegitables, fried potatos with oregon, greek-pitta, tzatziki and mustard sauce.It was enough for the two of us, was delicious and the two draft keo beers we ordered came immediately and were cool as we like.The dessert was Mahallepi and was offered by the shop. The bill we paid was 18.5 Euro for the two of us. We will go again !!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Although we had to wait for half an hour to get a table(no reservation accepted),we did not regret it!Very tasty plates for reasonable price!we ordered 3 different platters(vegetable/meat/chicken),2 salads,2 cheese saganaki wine and water for 67 euro !we were six persons !the quantity and quality were very good so we will definitely visit it again.It is better to be there around 8 oclock or after 10!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
40,"This place is ideal for kebab, souvlaki and meat platter. It is value for money and the location and atmosfere is also good.",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"I have visited this reataurant today. The quality of food was ok. It could be better though... One of my friends was fasting, therefore we ordered salad without fetta cheese. The salad came with fetta cheese on top! We also ordered saganaki and we said clearly to the waiter not to put any kind of cheese! No way... The food came to us with cheese topping! The souvlaki portion even though it clearly says that serves two... The quantity was enough for 1 person! The price is reasonable for the food served but generally it could be better!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We went today to Piatsa Gourounaki to check out whether this new place is really that good or not. At first, the place was very crowded when we arrived and had to wait in the queue, fortunately for about 10 minutes. We have ordered a meat platter and a big portion of chicken souvlacki, together with ""tyrosalata"" , ""melitzanosalata"" and a couple of draft beers for 3 persons. Our order arrived within 15 minutes and the overall impression was that everything was really good. Maybe the meat quantity was not that impressive, however it was almost satisfactory. The bill was 32 euros and we were offered also desserts on the house at the end, which is really nice, very typical in Greece, however very rare in Cyprus.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Seriously. We've been here a week... in the north, in the southern towns and all over. And this was the best. We had a chicken platter and it was SO good. Fresh, tasty, not greasy. Lots of variety on it.This place is busy, but definitely a must!! The service was great--- in particular our handsome waiter Rade.Go there- really.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"We first found this place walking around the streets of Nicosia. We were drawn to the atmosphere and made note to maybe try it later. I'm glad we went back because our experience was great. Arriving at opening (7:00pm) I was expecting an empty restaurant but it was already filling up so I suggest going early. There is not an English menu at the restaurant but its not a problem because the staff will help you order something delicious. We ordered a greek salad and a chicken platter to share. Three styles of chicken, grilled veggies, fries and two dipping sauces made the perfect meal. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere has a relaxed, fun, upbeat and modern feel. I would suggest this place if your looking for good food, service and atmosphere.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Supper for two - no reservations, just turn up. Good menu, the sharing platter was a treat. Plenty for two hearty appetites. Great atmosphere with excellent service. By eight thirty, the place was full, with folk waiting for tables.",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"This is the best Souvlaki ever i tried...finily somebody open in Lefkosia such nice and tradiotional place..if you ask me to rate from 0 to 10...i give 10....dont waste time go and try will get in love with every single thing there..food,stuff,value,atmosphere!!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
50,"Hands down the best kebab/souvlaki joint in Cyprus.We went there the first day it opened and still go back once a week. Everything we've tried so far was amazing! The chicken kebab, lamb-beef kebab, the lamb chops and pork souvlaki, even the fries, the grilled vegetables, the halloumi, and the desserts are amazing!! Actually I am very picky when it comes to pork souvlaki, but thinking about their souvlaki makes my mouth watery. Marinated in herbs, juicy and perfectly cooked!The staff is very friendly and there is a great atmosphere. We also met the owner, who is very polite and always around to make sure that his clients get the best service!The perfect spot for a quick and delicious dinner. One could have a fulfilling meal with just 7-10 euros including drinks and 1-2 starters!Great location, downtown and easily accessible. It is always packet and due to the fact that they don't make reservations you'll have to wait a bit to get sited, but it is definitely worth the wait!!",Piatsa Gourounaki
30,"Been there for the first time last nigh(Friday night) with some friends.The restaurant does not accept reservations but we were prepared for that since there has been a bit of a buzz for it on the social media. We waited for 20-25 minutes and we were seated inside.The place is brand new, decoration is very good and the seating arrangement is really confortable making every single table quite easy to sit and eat.For the tables that are next to the cooking and grilling area, noise can be a bit of a problem in case they are expecting a quiet relaxed dinner. It's a new place so there's a lot of panic in the kitchen and the guys working there are quite loud. This is acceptable though, i wouldn't say that it was annoying and i am not a person who expects going out in packed places expecting to have a quiet relaxed dinner.We had a small issue with some of the glasses we were supposed to use for water. The owner came and changed them himself.Food is interesting but it needs a lot of improvement.We ordered 3 different varieties(vegetarian, chicken and meat varieties) for 2 persons each even though we were 5 and an extra small salad. Therefore we expected for food to be more than we could handle since the 2 ladies that we were together always eat less than expected.In the end we ate everything that was there and we felt that we were still hungry.The quality and taste of the food is good. Nothing special though. Of course one can say ""what can you expect from grilled chicken, pork, french fries and grilled vegetables""?. I would say ""Why not a pleasant surprise?""We all found the pork souvlaki tasteless and the grilled vegetables on the side were overcooked and really flat. Chicken variety, kebab, pita bread with halloumi cheese were good though.I believe that the varieties that are supposed to be enough for 2 persons are not that great and for what they are i should say that they are quite expensive. Especially the veggie one will never be enough for 2 persons as a main course to share.Due to the issue we had with the glasses the owner stepped in and told us that everything was on the house and he also offered us complementary desserts.I must admit that this has never ever ever ever happened to anyone of us in Cyprus.We really appreciated his move and we really hope that he takes care of any similar issues that appear giving attention to his customers at all times.Overall it was a good experience but i am afraid that at the moment my rating will not be that great due to the 3-4 issues that caused negative discussions and comments between us.I would encourage anyone to visit the place, preferably on more quite nights than Friday and Saturday. I will definately go back soon to see how it is doing. Grilled food and Greek cuisine is our favorite.",Piatsa Gourounaki
