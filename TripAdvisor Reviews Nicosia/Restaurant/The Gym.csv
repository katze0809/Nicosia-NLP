50,Highly recommended. Very elegant environment with nice music. The service was very good too. There is a quite interesting dining menu and whatever we ordered was delicious indeed.,The Gym
50,"Went down on a whim, had the bao buns which wound up being some of the best I've ever tasted - the Emerald tini was a great accompaniment as well; service was polite and attentive - I'll be back!",The Gym
10,"I paid 13 euros for 3 miserable bao buns that were made probably 2 days ago...I wish I was exaggerating but I am not. even the mayo was dried and had this ""lovely ""yellowish color. The chicken burger was even worse. Please don't waste your money",The Gym
50,"Very professional, respectful and kind staff. Made us feel very at home and added to the overall experience. Absolutely phenomenal food! Very interesting concepts for dishes and incredible plating. Nice sized portions to keep you full but not too much. Professional mixologists and delicious looking and tasting drinks. Gorgeous interior design and very welcoming for dinner. Would love to revisit it and would recommend it to anyone visiting Nicosia who is a foodie!",The Gym

50,I Find quality in artistic place with people who love what the do and they have vibes who give you a good night out,The Gym
50,"While there are plenty of restaurants that offer great Cypriot dishes in Nicosia, finer meals are difficult to find. I love The Gym's small menu which means fresh ingredients. Over the years I have visited this restaurant, the quality of the dishes has constantly been high. I have tried almost everything on their menu and there is nothing I would not eat again. Here is a suggestion: take the roasted beet salad with crispy goat cheese and the tuna tataki as a starter, pork cheeks for main, and banoffee for desert. Add a bottle of white Melissopetra wine and you have an out of the ordinary meal. The Gym is always a highlight when I visit Cyprus.",The Gym
50,So tasty and well presented dishes. I loved the langoustine risotto dish. The deserts was ok and the portions important . I recommend this place. Good atmosphere and service . The average plate price is between 17 to 24 euros and desert is 8 euros.,The Gym
40,Popped in here for lunch when in Nicosia recently. The decor is cool and looks smart. Service was polite and attentive. The menu is not that extensive but that's fine at lunchtime. I chose the Caesar Salad - I felt it was a little too salty but my friend thought it was the best he's ever had so there you go. All the meals we had were good and the price was reasonable. Would certainly recommend for a lunch visit.,The Gym
40,"I'd searched around for a coffee that would appeal to my hipster sensibilities, and The Gym has it. They also serve coffee with a side biscuit or two, in fact, I think all drinks come with something. The red wine selection is fantastic.",The Gym
30,"We dropped in for a light lunch after a long walk. What more appropriate then a joint called The Gym?In Nicosia, people smoke, a lot. I thought that at a place called The Gym, it might be different. It was. If you like a woman sticking her fag in your ear, this is the place for you.Otherwise the food was okay. Stella was good. The servers couldn‚Äôt care less. Maybe it was because we weren‚Äôt Smoking.",The Gym
40,The place is located in the old city of Nicosia at Onasagorou street. Its an old restored building made of stone and wood and the owners gave it a modern look with the addition of steel and canvas decoration. You can call it cozy with nice music matching the time that you are visiting. The stuff are nice and polite and they gladly propose drinks to match your taste. Their drinks are nice and inspired. The place offers also food which is good and tasty. The portions are a bit small but by no means poor. Overall is a nice place to visit if you want a tasty snack or a drink to chill out.,The Gym
50,Regular visitor for past 2 years.. love especially their gin tonic cocktails.. tried also few dishes and always very tasty.. very stylish place.. it‚Äôs a restaurant/bar/gallery all in one.. worth visiting..,The Gym
10,"This is the second time we're ""accidentally"" overcharged. Last time, we noticed it on time, this time, we missed it. Four persons, five meals.On another note, food is really good albeit a bit expensive and service is otherwise very good. Still, this is the last time we visit.",The Gym
50,"Excellent cocktails - try anything with Gin, it‚Äôs amazing! The food was lovely too. We had great fish and seafood pasta for main course. And Excellent shrimpGyoza and Succulent tuna tataki as starters. Last but not least, the decoration and atmosphere was great too. Old tiles decorate the floors, comfortable seating everywhere, on a cool night it‚Äôs nice to eat at their veranda. This place is worth the visit and its great value for money.",The Gym
50,Not one to write reviews on this occasion I have to say this place does some of the best cocktails ever.,The Gym
50,"Hello, I‚Äôm a Hilton Diamond member and frequent traveler to Bogota. Michele in the Gym is definitely one of the best resources in the hotel. Friendly and always willing to help. Very professional. The staff in the hotel is excellent.",The Gym
50,"There is nothing negative to say about this place since it‚Äôs amazing! Excellent service, high quality food (the menu changes with each season) and unique atmosphere! By far my favorite bar/restaurant in Nicosia!",The Gym
50,They recommend the gym from our hotel so we booked a table for dinner. We have been surprised from the ambience of this place. Very nice food excellent choices of wine by the glass. We had few days in Nicosia and we didn‚Äôt missed the gym not even for one day.I totally recommend it.,The Gym
40,"Very friendly staff, nice ambiance and good collection of cocktails and wine. Only no food for vegetarians only salads they have üòäfor vegetarians",The Gym
50,"We were in Nicosia for 3 days and unexpectetly we found this great place. Its not just a bar or restaurant its something very unique.We had many coctails but try their velvet whisper and zombi. For food we had ceviche, shrimps gyoza and fresh tuna, amazing dishes!Dont miss their beautifull country yard if you want to relax but avoid it if its really hot.I wish i could post some photos.",The Gym
50,The old town of Nicosia is the part worth visiting. The gym is the best place in Nicosia with the highest standards in food drinks service and shopping. Don‚Äôt miss the gallery and the courtyard!,The Gym
50,We pop in while walking in Onasagorou str Actually we just wanted to wonder the place since it was looking beautiful and take some photographs too. however we end up drinking their amazing cocktails from 7pm until all night long!! Their signature margarita was superb.I am sure they have great food for dinner as I saw the plates passing next to me. A must try for the next time.,The Gym
50,"Great bar superb cocktails. Nice atmosphere, don't miss to check out their gallery. There is also a small but beautiful back yard if you want privacy. Their food and bites are amazing too.",The Gym
50,"We found this by mistake last Thursday & went back Friday & Sunday , love the place .Good staff & good selection of gins !!!Had pork cheeks there on the Friday & very very good all tho as I read on other comments about the size being small portions , yes they was , my wife had Banofee & that was a big portion for a desert .All in all we all really liked it .",The Gym
50,As we were wandering the old town we happened on the Gym. Wandered in and loved the attention to the cocktails being made. We checked out the menu and booked for the next nightFantastic menu. Wonderful flavours. Great service and perhaps the best tuna dish everService was excellent. This is very accomplished cooking in a very funky spaceYou will love it,The Gym
50,"A quirky bar restaurant in the old town , fantastic cocktails and great food but the best thing was the great staff there is also a very quirky little shop out the back which is worth a look",The Gym
30,"Located in the old town, The Gym has a nice ambiance and background music. The food is lovely BUT the portions are tiny!! They are the size of a gourmet restaurant in London rather than Cyprus. Just getting a main dish with no starter(s) is not enough to fill you up and you‚Äôll leave the restaurant feeing hungry wondering whether you should get a take away kebab on your way home.",The Gym
50,"The gym has been my favorite place the last couple of years.Even though i have a great time in other places in Nicosia, at the gym we experience something unique. I don't know, it is a mixture of several things. It is the vibe, the ambience but not only.There you can feel the energy of a proper bar and at the same time having a fine dining experience. The music is great, food very creative and cocktails are super. You can also find more than 50 choices of wine by the glass.I couldn't recommend it more!!",The Gym
50,The cocktails at the gym is super especially the presentation. Cool music and cool vibes in general. The decor and ambience of the place is fantastic. Last time went at the gym on Sunday for brunch and we end up having cocktails until late afternoon!!,The Gym
50,"Nice atmoshire / music, people 30-45 of age, very goog service,you need reservation. you have to walk a little to find it.",The Gym
50,We first visited the gym a year ago and since then it's my favorite place in Nicosia.At my last visit we started having cocktails at the bar listening to very nice music. We proceeded with our dinner which for another one time everything was excellent. The dishes were very creative taking our culinary experience to the next level.,The Gym
50,"Excellent food. The place is simple and beautiful. Theres a harmony to it and its great for friends, couples...at the bar. Great cockteils and hosts",The Gym
50,"The package is great. Staff, food, decoration, seating - just great. Friendly service, great food and cocktail.",The Gym
30,"Called without a reservation. We‚Äôre given a high table with stools, which was fine. However, it was so dark we couldn‚Äôt read the menu. We asked for a candle but were told we couldn‚Äôt have one. Staff just seemed a bit disinterested and preoccupied. Had to read the menu with my iPhone torch. Food arrived and risotto was very good. My wife‚Äôs chicken was not hot so we asked for it to be heated up. Took 10 minutes to do this as I think they prepare another dish. Whilst the new dish was hot (and tasty), it did mean I had almost finished the risotto when it arrived. Shiraz was most acceptable. All in all, food was good but service lacking.",The Gym
50,"The Gym is a welcome respite from the hundreds of touristy restaurants throughout Cyprus (though there are many great local places). The food was very tasty and well prepared; small menu but for lunch still something for everyone. The restaurant itself is very comfortable; smoking outside only, with some amazing items in their gift shop and a very interesting and eclectic decor. The wait staff and bartender were great; very accommodating. Next time through Nicosia, we will definitely try it out for dinner.",The Gym
20,"We tried four different dishes, none was satisfactory. In sense of taste. Quality wise no issues. Coffee very weak.",The Gym
50,"First time we went for a quick lunch, the second for a longer breakfast. Both times it was awesome, though slightly expensive. The coffees were outstanding. I had the cheese in pastry, one daughter had a Cesar salad and the other the Cesar wrap‚Ä¶all were great.Breakfast was the poached eggs with salmon and avocado plate, scrambled eggs and pancakes with Nutella. WOW.And the d√©cor is great, too. Make sure you walk toward the back and see the enclosed patio, have a coffee there if it isn‚Äôt raining.",The Gym
10,"They destroyed my evening , the manager/ host is racist. We made reservations for 3 people outside, nobody informed us we will be seated right next to exit with wind and no heaters. Was very cold so I went to manager/host with request to move us inside as soon as someone else will leave. He was very rude and he said that we will not seat in side and nobody will not leave!!! I came back to the table, he came after me and was complaining to my greek friends in Greek about me !!!! I asked him in English and he put me down and keep talking in Greek. This is unacceptable I have sent a letter from my law agency to Cyprus tourist organization to see this case in the racist background.After 15 minutes other table left he did not move us there, then next table left so we get up and seated there.When we ask to remove some ingredients from the menu we got answer ‚Äúyou are not allowed ‚Äú I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt like mussels why can‚Äôt I remove it?That means they must have ready dishes, here was again attitude from the waiter.The place has high prices and I‚Äôm fine with it, but I expect service and quality, here I haven‚Äôt got anything. On top of that place was dirty, I even saw a disgusting part of the store room and made pictures. The worse part is that I have destroyed my evening and all we were very upset allNight for such stupid reasons :(Don‚Äôt go there is you don‚Äôt want to finish the same",The Gym
50,"Being a large group we could taste many plates and everything was well thought-out in terms of taste, texture and inventive combinations but not too eclectic so everyone could enjoy the food. We just missed the possibility of ordering a bowl of soup or a simple salad. The service was attentive and professional.",The Gym
50,"Happened to come across the Gym whilst shopping. Attractive exterior and nicely laid out inside. Small menu but I like that, very high quality food and presentation. Highly recommended. üëç",The Gym

20,Clean restaurant. Clean toilets. Friendly staff. Very good hot chocolate. Good drinks/coffees. Average tasting food. Too small portions. Expensive for what is offered.,The Gym
50,"Amazing bar, fantastic cocktails and very friendly staff! We got wine, cocktails and platter with cheese and prosciutto. It have been a while since I had a descent zombie!",The Gym
50,"One of the best steaks in town, although you would need a starter dish as well. Great wine list, many by the glass and an enjoyable atmosphere.",The Gym
50,"I came here for brunch.I had a black angus burger which was really delicious, tidy and easy to hold. The wedges were also hot and tasty.My girlfriend was happy with her eggs on toast as well.All in all, we had a great Sunday noon experience.",The Gym
40,Another pleasant evening spent in the Gym with lovely food and wine. Service was really good too. Well worth a visit.,The Gym
50,"We met up with friends for a birthday celebration - the evening kitchen opens from 8pm so we enjoyed a few pre dinner drinks at the bar , where we were offered cheese and bread rusks which were delicious.The evening menu had a limited but very good variety, we started with a delicious spinach anari salad which had an amazing dressing, warm bread was served with rosemary infused dipping oil .Followed by 3 of the party ordering fillet steak (a tad on the small size ) cooked to perfection and seabass , which was flaky and moist with a wonderful crispy skin. Mouthwatering.Deserts were absolutely delicious, we chose one of each .Good attentive staff , very accommodating, even though the place was very busy by the time was left . We will definitely return, thoroughly recommend...",The Gym
40,"Original bar/restaurant in the core centre of Nicosia hidden behind a leafy facade of the small terrace. Inside you will find old brick walls combined with some modern elements, unusual details, neon lights, an impressive ceiling light hanging in the middle of the room (see my pic) and even an art gallery.The menu a little bit too ‚Äúshort‚Äù in my opinion but what I got was simply excellent: crispy goat salad, sea bass fillets and a sort of dark chocolate dessert. I was impressed by the superb wine list with a professional choice of local (Cypriot) wine too. I went for a quite rare indigenous grape variety: Morokanella by Aes Ambelis Winery ... a great choice. Anyway before my selection we were sent by the waiter a wine connoisseur who exp plain in details the local wines which I was interested in. Professional service. Average prices. If you gave not here before ... certainly a place to give a try.",The Gym
50,"Stopped for late lunch and look forward too visiting again next time in ledra street.Good size portions especially for the price, everything is cooked fresh and you can tell.We had the homemade lemonade and was delightful, I had a few of the bar and the drinks going out made me wish I wasn‚Äôt driving!And the staff was friendly and service efficient too ‚úÖEasily recommend to all.",The Gym
10,Went here tonight and have to say what an absolutely dreadful night. Customer service was horrendous. They have no idea about allergies and what to expect when someone with allergies comes into there restaurant. I told them what im allergic to and are that clueless they put the most dangerous things I couldnt eat on a plate. Stay away to be honest!,The Gym
50,"excellent cocktails, by far the best cosmopolitan in town and a very good service in and out of the bar!!",The Gym
40,We went with my husband for a date night! We ordered the chicken and loved it but to be honest the portion was kind of small! I got the Blossom drink and really enjoyed it and my husband got something Red .....(something)which he really liked aswell! The staff was friendly and the prices of the drinks reasonable! The atmosphere was also calming and perfect for a date! I would go back again for a drink but not for food! Too little and too expensive for our taste I believe!,The Gym
50,"We found the Gym quite by accident, just wanted a snack, we were quite tired and fed up of walking ........What a find.......not a large menu, a very different menu that actually suited me.......it has to be the most adventurous amazing meal that I have had the pleasure to eat for a long time...... the menu may not suit some people but my husband who definitely does not like change actually ate steak tartare........I was so surprised at his choice but he just loved it, I had the Tuna dish which sent my taste buds chomping at the bit for more........we booked a table for the following evening as we so enjoyed the experience.The wine list is excellent, some of their best wines are available by the glass which is a rarity these days......I just cannot recommend the Gym enough.",The Gym
40,"Starting with a bottle of white fresh white wine. Following a very nice tuna salat complementary home baked bread. Main dish: Salmon for my wife, beef steak filet for me. Friendly service, nobody hurry‚Äôs. Lefkosia itself is not that interesting, The Gym made in worthwhile.",The Gym
50,Fantastic coktail choices Very nice place One of the best place to eat in city center And everething for a correct price,The Gym
40,Only came here for drinks and sat in the inside courtyard. Really nice cocktails and laid back atmosphere. Great to visit with friends. Prices are what you would expect (6.5-9 euro) for alcoholic beverages. Would go again to try more.,The Gym
40,"A quaint place with character. The Gym has an opinion, and that is the marriage of old and new, of trend and traditions. The venue is, by all means, a wonderful ode to heritage, being it an old but preserved building restored but yet maintaining its former personality. The new touches that have been added are enough to attract a stylistically interesting crowd, although I do believe the decor inside could have been much better and interesting. The food is good, not a marvel, but decent enough to spend an evening there with friends and enjoy the overall atmosphere. The only setback for me is the parking in the area which during peak hours is totally chaotic. Other than that a good presence in the old part of Nicosia.",The Gym
50,It is not the first time I visit this place and always the food is good as expected. However the portions are shrinking ! The chicken with cheese was tasty and the daiquiri was well done and fruity. The service was good with slight delay. The atmosphere is always amazing. I recommend it,The Gym
40,The good things about this venue is the interior design and the service quality. The waiters are polite and helpful . The capacity is big enough that you can find a place even though you have not reserved for a table. It has open terrace for smokers and a bar scene for who do not. However the menu options need to be expanded a little. When we had the dinner 3 options were unavailable and we had difficulty to choose from the remaining. And this happened a couple of times so now we are thinking if we can find the dishes we like.,The Gym
40,"This is a nice bar to hang out with friends for coffee, drinks, brunch or dinner. It has a bit of everything at good quality.",The Gym
50,"This unique place became our spot. Lunch or Dinner, Coffees or Drinks! New tasteful cocktails. Evolution in mixing. Magical dishes with fresh ideas especially at lunch time. We always enjoy the bruch with a couple of cocktails relaxing and chatting. Service is at its best!",The Gym
30,"So this place is usually packed. I mean you could hear the chatter 300 meters. They have an inside and outside setting. The outside setting is unique in that its partially covered, so you get the outside along with a bit of privacy. I walked into the restaurant at 11 the first time only to be told the kitchen had closed so I had a drink with friends and promptly left. The second visit was a head scratcher as I entered at 9 pm and the waiter told me the kitchen didn't open till 12. He served my friends and I some nuts and drinks. And we left 20 minutes afterwards. So I really didn't get a chance to experience their food, and their seemed to be confusion amongst the staff.",The Gym
40,"Definitely the place to get fancy cocktails in Nicosia, its not cheap compared to other places in the area but one hundred percent worth it. If you like something with a bit of theatrics then get the zombie, I won‚Äôt spoil the surprise by saying why though.",The Gym
50,"get reservation for dinner, great staff, bar really good, cocktails interesting, lunch is not their primary goal, dinner menu with all fresh local food is their special time, in side the old walls, get reservation for dinner or supper, neat little garden, art is really good, get the story about why it's called the gym.We just got burgers, hers was chicken mine meat, cooked as ordered well done, we were not taking any chances, we didn't need to worry, but beer ws good, cold, day was hot, water was good, pleasant stone building, we got tour by manager, He came out to chat and asked to confirm how we found him, showed him artiicle, which had not been an ad.Next time we are coming for supper.",The Gym
40,"Although the music is always very load, the place is very nice to spend your evening for casual chat, a drink or two and if you are hungry the food is above average.",The Gym
50,"We went for dinner and drinks. The food was excellent, the wines suggested by the staff very good, the service really friendly, cocktails very good. I personally liked the decor very much as well, and the place has a very nice vibe! Recommended!!",The Gym
40,We took a hot & sweaty walk to The Gym on a recent visit to Nicosia! It was so worth it. A very cool & quirky place with food to die for. The shrimp linguine is just delicious. Would very definitely recommend!,The Gym
40,"Another quirky bar in the old city, the gym has a great cocktail selection and is laid out over a fairly large area with an integrated art gallery space and an internal open air courtyard where one can hide away for the afternoon. The service was slower than some of the other places we have been (but we were hidden away and out of sight in the courtyard) but loved the ambience. Would definitely go back for a drink.",The Gym
40,"Excellent choice for a coctail or a glass of wine. The location is perfect, in the center of the town near ledra's street. Normal prices. Very nice decoration. The staff wasn't very quick. Bellina coctail is recommended!",The Gym
50,"The gym is one reason to visit Nicosia!! Great team at all! Amazing food, perfect cocktails, great staff. The atmosphere is unique and the architectural exeptional in 19th century building. The prices are reasonable for this quality. Thanks a lot for everything! Great work!",The Gym
50,"Wandering the street of Nicosia on an empty stomach is not too much of a problem as so many restaurants are available throughout the old city. The Gym was a good place for a main course and a glass of white wine. The place was fully booked but I found a seat at the bar. The welcome was not great and the front of house must be improved. However, the team behind the bar are great, knowledgeable and very friendly. I was advise two great local white wines from AES Ambelis Winery and a Spourtiko 2017 Vintage from Vouni Panayta Winery. Both wines were amazing. Try these wines next time you are in Cyprus and at The Gym. It is a great restaurant, trendy with a small but delicious menu. A must try in Nicosia.",The Gym
40,A cozy restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Interesting and small menu ‚Äì as I like it. Everything we tried was good and the service is very friendly and efficient. A good choice for dinner.,The Gym
50,Located in the old town. The drinks cocktails were very tasty and egg food delicious. I ordered the pork cheeks: it was tender and good. The service was excellent and the waiter very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend the place.,The Gym
50,Excellent food with a small Art Gallery at the rear the proprietor is setting new standards for the city in this great little restaurant.,The Gym
30,"Nice food, but definitely overpriced. Smoking and non-smoking areas are rather virtual. Better try something else for your night out.",The Gym
30,"Great location, presentation and general style, to both the venue and menu. However, in practise, my friends and I found the food to be somewhat mediocre. Nothing wrong with it but hard to get excited about. Would re-visit but with tempered expectations.",The Gym

50,"Excellent friendly and cool staff. Very good food. Great atmosphere. In the old city, in interesting area.",The Gym
50,The place is amazing. The decoration and how the building is built is magnificent. I went during morning hours to try the brunch pancakes. The pancakes were delicious and the presentation of it very pleasant. My only issue is that the restaurant opens earlier than the time they can serve. I went at 10:15 and i had to wait until 11 when their kitchen would open so that i can have my pancakes. It would be best if their kitchen could start earlier or open their restaurant around 10:45 so that people don't wait.,The Gym
50,"Everything I've eaten at The Gym has been a revelation, with each ingredient in perfect harmony. Often very busy, but they always went out of their way for us.",The Gym

40,"I stopped here for lunch with friends on a day excursion to Ledra shopping high street in the old town of LefkosiaThe restaurant had some quirky features, such as interesting signage on the toilet doors resembling male and female body parts. There also a link to a gallery at the back featuring local art and a wishing well feature.There is outdoor seating at the front and a nice enclosed outside space at the back to chill and relax.The food was slightly expensive but the portion sizes were good , I had the salmon, spinach and rice which was delicious!",The Gym
50,"I tried it this place for lunch when it first opened its doors. And the food was ok... an average place i thought... In December I was invited by some friends and i was so surprised the food went up in appearance, quality, taste and creativity.... The food is amazing... to say the least.... The chef is a young Cypriot and I have to Tip my hat to him, there are very few restaurants in Cyprus serving this type of food... Now I hope they can keep the standard up as that's usually the story in Cyprus...",The Gym
20,"-Went to The Gym for brunch after looking at their online menu and we were informed that they don't have a brunch menu. Ended up ordering off the lunch menu, food was OK.-Service was terrible. The restaurant was almost empty and we hardly got any attention and/or service within reasonable time.Even worse, a couple stepped in, got a table and ordered coffee. 20 minutes after they made the order (they were still expecting their coffee...) another customer stepped in claiming they will be bringing about 20 people in and the waitress made the couple move to a different table, even though there were other tables to merge instead of the one they were occupying. Not only they made the couple move, they were very rude about it, and (I'm glad) the couple decided to leave (they didn't even get their coffee).As they were walking out, the same waitress said ""I didn't do anything wrong"" out loud, which was just overly rude to do, especially after her rude and unreasonable request.That being said, the atmosphere is nice if you exclude the service, but wouldn't return there for the food.",The Gym

The cocktails were excellent, based on classics but with a twist. Best G&T I‚Äôve had for ages, the ‚Äòbaby blue‚Äô try it! Also a great cosmopolitan. Best to book if you want to eat, which we will definitely do on another occasion. Would recommend.",The Gym
50,"We enjoyed an excellent night out with friends. The music was great, the drinks amazing.The food was very very nice, the portions were small (for the men especially) but because of a delicate dinner i consider the price reasonable.The atmosphere is quite relaxed with good service. It was a little chilli but there were blankets to use ( A+ for that).",The Gym

In the place you can drink coffee or alcohol! also has nice food and a small amount of desserts! we will definitely visit it again!",The Gym
50,"I'm posting two reviews on this place, because it's important to note that the location, the decor and the cocktails are original and oh-so-yummy. But the food isn't up to snuff. So go for cocktails and mini bites, and enjoy the best drink ever made with mastiki (gum) and yogurt. Yum.",The Gym
50,"A must go place with great staff, menu and interior. Try the 12 hour pork steak and any gin cocktail asking for the monkey gin!",The Gym

30,"expensive and low quantities of food trying to be gourmet in the mid of the old city is tricky although they make great hugos and serve good wine, service need to get better, and so do prices",The Gym
40,"Sunday brunch here is very nice. The servings are perfect size. Not a lot of modifications or substitutions with their menu, but they will try to accommodate for allergies where needed. Overall, enjoyed my meal and would go back again.Also stopped in for drinks on a Friday evening and after one margarita realized either I was dehydrated or their drinks are potent, since I was a little wobbly when I left.",The Gym
40,"Great ambiance, very relaxing music and atmosphere; very nicely renovated and decorated old building. I could sit here for hours enjoying a chilled glass of white wine. Tried a couple of salads and the home made cheese pie. Was good with interesting use of roasted almonds and nuts in the various dishes. Particularly liked the goat cheese with honey in one of the salads. Tried the asyrtiko white wine, Sigalas Santorini from the barrel. Love this wine. The staff is very friendly. One of the things I did not like is that they served the bread with pink Himalayan salt. Come on, Cyprus salt is know worldwide and sought after in Europe and the US, they could have added some local black or white salt which is much better.This is a place I would visit again.",The Gym

50,"This is a great place. Couldn't fault lunch (smoked salmon and avocado sandwich and cheese pie). Staff friendly, and very helpful to two Brits lost in the July heat in the narrow streets of this part of town.",The Gym
50,A busy but beautiful place to stay and relax. Lunch or dinner. For a light meal or for a full menu. The bar is the main attraction of this place with expert barkeepers. Tasteful cocktails. The music is always amazing. Not the normal hits of the week but a beatiful selection. The food is excellent,The Gym
50,Very nice place for coffee and brunch.There is a great variety of fresh juices and cocktails. Food might seem a little bit pricey but it is definitely worth it.It is a very popular place with unique design in the center of the city in the old neighborhood . During the weekends it can be difficult to get a table. Service is nice and polite.Just by luck I have found out that the baristas here are taking barista trainings from the owner of my favorite coffee shop of Crete the Crop :-),The Gym
10,"We went to The Gym for lunch yesterday and the service was pretty bad. My partner ordered a Caesar salad, which doesn't usually have mustard seeds, although this one did, and she is allergic (mustard/mustard seeds were not listed as an ingredient on the menu). We asked the waiter to check if this salad indeed had mustard seeds, which was a debacle in itself as he did not seem to speak Greek or English. When we asked if they could make a new one without dressing/with a different dressing he said 'just swap meals'. Cool mate, never coming back here.",The Gym
40,"Not exceptional, impersonal and colorless restaurant, with good food. Located in the old town. I can't recommend any specific plate. I guess the place is more for drinking rather than eating.",The Gym

50,Best and special food. Great taste. We had a special aragula salad and chicken wrap and for dessert we eat pancakes with caramel apple and ice cream. All of them were great.,The Gym
40,"The Gym offers great food and a lovely atmosphere, the decoration is so trendy and modern! A real hip place!The food is very good but the portions are pretty small, so if you're very hungry, I would recommend an appetizer or dessert to be sated.Also, the drinks and wine are very good.",The Gym
20,No value for money here. Just fancy designs and trendy staff. Ordered salmon and it was dripping in oil and the salad consisted of spinach and two tomatoes. Luckily I moved onto another restaurant,The Gym
50,"We had a family reunion here and the food was great, from the salads, to the tuna carpaccio to the squid risotto, tomato and cheese risotto and the prawn linguini. Each plate was terrific. But a special note for the squid risotto. The staff were attentive, but a little to eager to take our plates away. We went there during the evening about 8.00pm with no reservation on a Thursday night. It had a few tables full. By the end of the evening the place was packed. The food had a modern twist with local produce. Portion sizes were just right. A lovely decor. Right in the center of the old town handy to taxis, buses etc. would highly recommend.",The Gym

50,"A friend and I wanted a night out for dinner, but not for Cypriot food! We loved it at the Gym and were so happy with our choice! A lovely homely feeling inside where the bar area is, all three dishes we had were really tasty and when I actually didn't like my glass of wine they changed it with a smile and no cost! The service was excellent!The only downside I find is that outside they secluded the sitting space with high iron installation with plants. Don't know if this is legal, but it is a bit suffocating!In any case, I highly recommend it!",The Gym

The Gym let us sit and order even though they weren't fully open in the kitchen yet (by 8pm it was full).

30,"The decor is a half attempt at something that could have been interesting, but feels like they didn't want to invest money in the place. The chairs are really uncomfortable, as if they don't want you to spend much time there. Food is average. Cocktails are ok. The staff are helpful and cheerful and the DJ played very nice music. Just scraped by with third star and will not be going back in a hurry.",The Gym

What impressed me the most is as well, lighted and covered with glass in the gallery that is in to the restaurant. We enjoyed our food and wine as well.",The Gym
50,"It was a perfect way to finish our day in Lefkosia. Nice surrounding with old buildings. When you go in, you feel immediately that the place is warm and cozy - old with just small necessary changes, high standard furniture, carpets on the old tiled floor and the music!!!We wanted to have something little to eat with our wine, and we ordered nicely spiced chicken and wild rice with spinach - simple and perfect.There was a menu of one page , so you know that more likely you will eat fresh cooked food.And I should not forget the friendly service.BRAVO SAS!!!",The Gym
50,"Restaurants visited the gym for the first time, it caught our attention beautiful design and nice atmosphere.We had a slight problem with selecting a table because the restaurant is quite large, but service at the restaurant was helpful and helped us choose, and gave us the menu. We ordered a salad with baked almonds and cheese Gravier, was tasty as a main dish we chose fresh salmon with spinach and wild rice and chicken fillet with cheese manouri. The dishes were obviously fresh, tasty, well-seasoned. To drink we ordered a well-chosen wine in the choice of advising us well oriented barman. The restaurant is highly recommendable, the waiters are nice, helpful and smiling. As for the price is not too expensive. We will definitely visit this place again.",The Gym
30,"Visited three times while visiting on business. First time was a pleasant evening, good food and great choice of cocktails, so much so, it brought us back on a Saturday evening. The restaurant was busy and we had to wait for a table, which was not a problem. What was a problem was once being shown to a table, having to ask for a menu, then having to ask for our order to be taken, for another drink. At that point, we gave up putting the experience down to it being Saturday and we hadn't booked.We returned for a third time, tempted by the promising first evening. But again it was the service that was what was disappointing and has reflected in the rating. We were shown to our table and order duly taken. Food came, it was good, table cleared and no question of did we want anything else. We did flag down a member of the waiting team down and asked for another round of drinks, which we got. But still no question of dessert. We gave up.I can understand Saturday evening being busy and the reason for the disappointing service, but a Tuesday night with 2 members of staff standing chatting to each other, and at times there were three or four just isn't what I expected. The place has great promise but really need to improve their service.",The Gym

The service is very good by a smiling and helpful attendant. The 2nd time, passed by in late afternoon before catching a flight back home for cocktails. The place was busy by a young local crowd. Good vibe!",The Gym

40,"We normally eat at The Gym at least once a week when we are in Cyprus where we stay around 6 months of the year. Limited Menu, but all the food is great. We particularly enjoy the Salmon on wild rice and spinach. For meat eaters, the home made burger on a platter looks fantastic! The decor is very interesting and there is an arts gallery of a variety of items which you can purchase. Great friendly service. The restaurant is situated a little off the main Ledra St in the old town.",The Gym
50,"A good choice for lunch, after a long walk at the old city's market. We sat outside and order a pomegranate salad as an apptizer and linguine for main. Salad was tasty and pastas were amazing. Lot of choices for wine by the glass. Smiling staff and fair prices.",The Gym

10,What can i say? I did not even get to try the food... visited with the family o a Sunday for lunch and even though a few tables were available we had to wait for 15 minutes until someone noticed us and showed us to our table.... another 10 minutes passed before someone brought us the menus.... it took us 5 minutes to decide what to get... and then.... NOTHING.. so after 20 more minutes waiting for someone to take out order we simply walked out... why do people invest so much money in restaurants but never bother to adequately train their personnel on how to treat clients????,The Gym
50,The Gym has offered consistently and improvement and is now one of the best restaurants in Nicosia. We tried great cocktails which was always one of its strong points. Beautiful tuna starter. I tried the slow cooker pork which was amazing. Great atmosphere. Good service. The Gym has the whole package. Well done!,The Gym
40,Came here for a few cocktails after watching the football I like the atmosphere in here and the service is fast and efficient,The Gym
40,"Trendy place with outside enclosed seating area on the street. Sadly the sun didn't reach us there but with the heater on it was very pleasant on a January lunch time. The bar area is extensive with the emphasis on the exotic cocktails and wines, but we came for lunch rather than these so although the clientele is the young set, they equally welcomed us oldies. Yes it's a short menu but well chosen to suit many tastes. I went for the fresh salmon and worried that it might come overcooked (as it often does in Cyprus) but it was just perfect, very tasty and arrived on a bed of rice mixed with wild rice and spinach. We skipped desert and had Cyprus coffees - one of the best I've had. On the way upstairs to the toilets I noticed a small shop of money-no-object arty farty works in a back room - one of which I recognised from a sculptor in Limassol. Interesting concept. If I lived in Nicosia - I might become a regular here.",The Gym

Simply stunning!!But then we ordered our main course. Once we finished the appetiser, the waiter came to pick up the plates. We tried to hand in our forks and knives but the waiter said, no, just the plates, so in effect we had to eat the main course with dirty cutlery!!The main course comes in. The portions were so small, we thought we ordered from the kids menu. However the prices were for adults!!Am so disappointed, really. Taste wise it was OK, but if you want to feel that you had a proper dinner, maybe you should order double. And pay double of course!!",The Gym
40,"A traditional neoclassical house in the heart of Nicosia. Well restored and nice interior concept design. The drinks and coffee are pretty good at this place.

I ended up searching for it my self.",The Gym

The service is good and the dishes offered are not similar to other places in the old town.

There is a list of different plates and i ricognise that also other people were suddisfied, We took a salad with goat cheese delisious. We taste the palate with solmon.

Also coctails are very famous there.",The Gym

10,"The poor waitress went back and forth to the kitchen at least four times negotiating with the chef because he refused to accomodate my food intolerances/allergies. He refused to budge on the concept of his menu. On the fourth try he agreed that it was not right that I leave hungry and agreed to make me a plain piece of fish, which is what I originally asked for. My group of 8 people had finished their meals and 3 bottles of wine as I negotiated. I give the waitress credit for her patience and willingness to help, she clearly was troubled by his temperament. When my fish finally arrived, it was very good, but getting it was a painful process.I hope the owner sees this review and schools the chef on customer service. It's not about his experience, it's about mine.If the chef is the owner, then those who have food intolerances should be aware.",The Gym

We where happy to get a table allthough in the smoking section (will not do that again ). The Place is hip & popular with locals, a bit pricy. Good vibe but a bit noisy for a romantic dinner for 2.We understand it was a busy evening but the service was not good.

We were in a very relaxed mood, so we didn't mind waiting, but about 40 min later we realized it had not arrived. The waiter was very polite and had brought the drunks, and some bread and butter in the meantime. The food arrived at 3:05 and one of the dishes was wrong. That was corrected within minutes and we enjoyed the food which was nice, just a bit on the overlooked side. Had some cocktails after that. The coconut ginger daiquiri was very nice.Would have given this place 4* (actually 3.5* if that was possible) as we enjoyed everything, except for the slow kitchen service and the cracked glass in which the daiquiri was served. Would recommend for a relaxed visit, but keep the above in mind.",The Gym
30,"The place looks attractive and cosy but gives off a really pretentious, wannabe high-end atmosphere, which is also portrayed on their menu. The place is not gourmet but attempts to be. The menu is just an A4 piece of paper that lists their insanely overpriced dishes. We got shrimp for starters and then the filled chicken for mains. We really liked the food but it was not enough, especially when considering how much it costs. I don't think I'm ever going back for dinner.",The Gym
40,Great food and drinks. Local and international drinks and snacks. Quite noisy but has a good vibe. In the old district so the atmosphere is great and the decor is the old stone walls on the inside. Service was very slow and it took a long while for someone to get us the bill.

Was rather disappointed with food, pricey and of average quality compared to what you can find around the area, so would rather stick to drinks and perhaps nibbles.",The Gym
30,"Go for the drinks, not for the food. The food is mediocre and bland, and overpriced for what you get. The salmon carpaccio came with a lot of grated carrot (!) which hid the taste of the salmon and made no sense whatsoever. The chicken with the manouri filling was tasteless and boring and at 13 euros, i expected a bit more from a dish that i could have prepared better at home. The sea food pasta was average, and the pasta was undercooked (not al dente. Undercooked).The service was not good as well. Over a dining floor with more than 25 diners, there was often no attending waiter (which meant that we had to catch their attention while they were serving drinks to the bar clientelle). Only positive, was the gentleman in charge of the wine who was helpful and knowledgable.Its a shame that such a place with such an ambiance and such a good menu (on paper) is not delivering.",The Gym

The best food in Nicosia in a great ambiance which reminds of the "" Meat packing District "" in NY.

I was told that this is not possible as I cannot change the recipe (!!!). My wife asked for the smoked salmon sandwich but asked not to have the cream cheese. She was told the same. She instead ordered something else and she got....the salmon and cream cheese, 45 minutes later.Their dishes were dry and bland. I shall not be visiting this place again.",The Gym

50,Modern place and an excellent service. Very tasty menu but in my opinion very expensive restaurant. Cyprus wines starts from 20 euro and i think its something not reasonable during the economical crisis. Only main dishes prices are reasonable.

So when myself and my girlfriend entered this very attractive cafe for refreshment, little did we know that the homemade lemonade we received would elicit a reaction which in normal circumstances would merit an 18 certificate.To some up, a world class lemonade, very nice layout, some well placed Dyson fans, a lovely salad plus a little gallery at the back... just to reiterate, a great lemonade!",The Gym
20,Decided to go there with some friends for a drink. unfortunately the menu for the drinks (e.g. cocktails) was really small and i had a difficulty what to choose since i couldn't find anything to drink. i decided to have a cocktail which was the WORST cocktail i've had in my life. Also the stuff was really rude. however i have to admit that the atmosphere was really nice. oh and also the prices are high,The Gym
50,"I've been to the Gym once before so this was my second visit after about 1 year. I have seen great improvement. Menu is short and very carefully selected. All the dishes were very well made. It's not expensive for what it offers. One of the best places in Nicosia. Only minus: by the time we got to deserts, the waiter didn't even offer to us the option. A while later when we tracked him down he told us kitchen was closed. May be they were thought we were on a diet! Strange..so if you want desert order in advance.",The Gym
50,"If you are looking for a quality place in Nicosia, The Gym is highly recommended! Professional people, Great bar, with amazing cocktails. excellent food and service. Enjoy a relaxing atmosphere at all times!",The Gym
50,Super duper cocktail menu and the barman was imaginative and fun to watch. Try the gin and tonic with ginger - to die for!!!,The Gym

50,"Didn't try any food, but had a few decent cocktails there to start the night. Revisited in the morning to recover. Had an excellent Bloody Mary that was so invigorating that I had to consume a second. Decent service, relaxed venue. Good selection of spirits.",The Gym
30,"After a long walk around onasagorou street, we decided to go to the Gym on a recommendation from a friend.I must say that our visit was a combination of ups and downs both in service and food.At first, when walking inside the place, it was only half full yet most of waiters seems rather uninterested to find us a table and just seemed to pre-occupied hovering at the back of restaurant joking around. We found a spot at one of the high tables and sat down only to be greeted by a somewhat rude and grumpy waiter. I know you cant always be at your happiest when you are at work and having worked as a waiter myself appreciate that its not the easiest job in the world, but a smile and making your customers feel welcome goes a long way.I ordered the smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich and my other half ordered one of the salads with spinach, anari and filo crumbled pastry.Although the sandwich was pretty good and tasty, with the salmon sandwiched inside a fresh wholegrain croissant, creme cheese and avocado, the salad was not so good. As a concept the salad was good, the taste was actually dreadful as it was absolutely drowned in an extremely sweet beyond belief dressing. It was practically inedible it was so sweet. At one point we started to wonder if they misinterpreted the salad for a soup as you could almost scoop out the dressing. Had it not been for the dressing, it would actually have been a nice salad. You have been warned. Stay clear of the spinach and anari salad drowned in super sweet dressing.Why I gave this place an average rating when the majority of my comments were negative? I liked the location, the vibe and the decor. The service, other than that one waiter possibly having a bad day, was good. My sandwich was also very tasty and fresh.Would I go here again? Not at first choice.",The Gym
50,Very nice inspired food. The atmosphere is great and warm. Quick service and very helpful staff. Nice drinks too. I would strongly recommend it.,The Gym
40,"My friend who's based in Nicosia had told me of this new restaurant/bar which apparently is one of the hot places to be seen in right now. I'm always dubious of these places because more often than not the reality never lives up to the hype.I dined with my two close friends on a Saturday night. We arrived a bit earlier than our 8pm booking as we'd been told earlier in the day when we were called to confirm that if we were more than 15 minutes late our table would be released. On arrival we were shown to our table at the very back of the restaurant, which had yet to be laid for the evening service although it was only 15 minutes before the dinner menu was being served. It took at least half an hour for someone to come and take our drinks order, which was slightly frustrating as there was not even water provided on the tables, our cocktails eventually arrived and were actually very good, our table was then laid as we were drinking and our order taken for food.We shared a spinach rice dish for starter which was really very delicious, my friend and I had the beef and our other friend the lamb. All were excellent cuts of meat, cooked beautifully, the only downside is what they were served with. The beef fillet was sat on an entire plate of mash with a few mushrooms under the meat, it was delicious but there was way too much mash and a few green vegetables would have made it perfect, the lamb was at the other end of the extreme, served only with a few vegetables and nothing else, we had the fruit platter for desert which was really lovely and beautifully presented. Overall this is a nice restaurant, the food was good, if a little pricey with a few tweaks it would be just perfect.",The Gym
50,"Walked past this place many times however never decided to pop in, the place is always busy with a nice crowd. Yesterday i went with wife and my 3 year old son, i was unsure if kids would be welcomed at 20h00 in the evening. However, no problem at all.We had great service at the bar, delicious cocktails. Last minute we decided to eat, this was no problem and a high table was set up quickly.I take my food very seriously and was skeptical, however, my Lamb Shank was amazing, really amazing! I paired the meal with a Cypriot wine which went down well.Please keep up the good work, as Cyprus has reputation of hit and miss service and food :-)",The Gym
50,"I love a good G&T ,but the real differentiator is the ingredients !We went to the Gym for a drink on Friday night.i usually have a preference to Gin and tonic and I was pleased to see their great selection of gins ! Furthermore the bartender knew his stuff very well and I was impressed that they serve Britvic tonic !Very rare I experience that kind of attention to the creation of a Gin and tonic !The service was great and the place amazing .Well done Ericca and the staff.",The Gym
20,Very expensive for what it offers. Limited selection of food and beverages. Smelly glasses and plates. There are much better cafeterias around the area than this one.,The Gym
40,"Not the first time I visited and not the first time I had an exquisite meal there accompanied by excellent cocktails. Sat at street level in a cosy environment warmed by heaters oblivious to a very cold night around us. The food served in nouvelle cuisine rhythms might be challenged to satisfy a quantity focused diner but will certainly meet the expectation of those seeking to satisfy fine dining palates. Service is attentive and pleasant, condiments however are not presented with the food or brought to the table by default, have to request these each time.An overall elating experience worthy of repeating on a regular basis.",The Gym
30,"My expectations for this place were high. The reviews I went through were almost perfect, so I was looking forward. And yes, the food was good (a little bit overpriced I guess 59euros for two persons), nice decor and location with a big, big ‚ÄúBUT ‚Äú...that actually ruined my night.Imagine yourself sitting in a place where outside temperature is 3 degrees Celsius with no heating on (or at least we did not feel any warm air towards us). On a better look around I have noticed that it is basically an open space. Although, it seems separate, there was interconnection between exterior and interior. Thus, I found it not possible to take off my warm jacket, due to a total absence of coziness, both literally and figuratively.How we were supposed to relax and feel comfortable when our bones got so tight by feeling cold, I was honestly ready to explode.Well, I thought that perhaps, maybe, we were the only ones having this problem, however, on a closer look around I've noticed that no, that was not the case. Most of the people were having there heavy coats and jackets on.Regarding the music, we couldn't hear any sound, only the discussions from the near tables, although there was something on the background.‚Ä¶to my opinion, there are better options for a night out, try Habana for example which is nearby.",The Gym
40,"Very good food, nice music, cosy placeSecond visit at night this time with friends.The place was almost full. We had a high table in the outside seating area with heaters around us. This felt really cosy since it was one of the coldest nights of the winter.I got the steak with potato sauce. It was almost perfect. I requested for medium cooking but it was a bit overcooked. Seasoning and taste were perfect though. The potato sauce was a bit buttery. My wife got the pumpkin risotto which was again almost perfect.It's been a while since we had such good food.Service needs a bit if improvement. Waiters we hard to be found at some point, but that's just a small detail.I am happy to raise the rating by one star and I most certainly recommend it for a great dinner. It was a pleasant surprise to find a high standard kitchen in the area.Keep up the good work. We are definitely going back soon.",The Gym
20,"Its an ok place with a good concept in mind. The food is not bad although not much accomodating when you ask for variations to what they offer. The juices are the only unique thing about this place, but all the second hand smoke you inhale sitting there defies the purpose of the healthy drinks they offer.",The Gym
40,In the streets of the old town of Nicosia the Gym is one of my favourite! It's a nice place to enjoy your wine in reasonable prices. But they don't offer a lot of glass wine and you have to order a whole bottle. Lately they removed my favourite rose one from the glass choice!!! It's getting crowded quite easily so it will depend how lucky you'll be to find a place!,The Gym
40,"The Gym was absolute perfect on a New Years day - relax atmosphere, good food and wine. First we have a couple of cocktail - highly recommendable! All in all a very pleasant experience!",The Gym
50,"Great atmosphere, delicious and fresh dishes, special cocktails and juices. We went to there for brunch and came back for dinner and drinks! One visit to The Gym is not enough!!! PS: Don't miss the gallery room at the back space",The Gym
30,"We visited The Gym last Saturday for a quick lunch. We chose a table on the outer row of tables on the busy Onasagorou street. The sitting area becomes quite packed when tables are full so there wasn't much space to move around easily with our baby stroller.We were happy to see that most of the ""camouflage"" walls of plants were removed and the place finally has a clear view of the street and more light is allowed to the inside.We chose to have some sandwiches, a salad and i personally had one of the burgers.The food was good. Nothing special, but for a cafe/bar you get what you expect and what you pay for.The burger was unfortunately overcooked and totally unseasoned but everyone else enjoyed their food so i suppose mine was a small mistake.Service is quite good. We didn't have any problems.The big issue was the constant ""visits"" we had from children singing christmas songs waving their hands for money, beggars, people selling diaries for orphans... It was a never ending story. It must have happened 5-6 times during the short period of time we spent there. The owner asked the waiters to keep an eye but there wasn't much they could do. It's a general problem i suppose, but if my shop was there i would take care of it.Overall it was a good experience but that's all i can say.",The Gym
40,"Great casual atmosphere with great food and good prices. Its a place to go with friends for drinks or dinner, same excellent service time and time again. Menu is a little limited but I believe there is something for everyone, maybe only one or two vegetarian choices and three or four meat choices but whatever you choose you will be impressed. The building has been renovated its all stone, its a mix of new and old to give it a warm and trendy feel. The prices and very reasonable, average, not over priced as most places you get for a good meal these days.",The Gym
40,"Went here a couple of times. Once for drinks,, and once for dinner. Very popular for drinks, wine was very good, and they specialize in mixed drinks. It's usually quite crowded with people mostly socializing over coffee or drinks. We ate a light dinner there and food was very good and very reasonable.",The Gym
50,"While not excited because let downs seem to be the norm here, the Gym has been very impressive. The menu is a bit limited and has not changed much since they've opened, but, the food is fantastic. The place has great character, very attentive staff. Prices are similar to most Nicosia establishments. We've had the fish, the lamb, and last week the steak which was as good as any steak we've had in Cyprus. This steak however was much cheaper than those found at other establishments. So far so good. Dinner is not served until 2000 hours and they do have english menus.",The Gym
50,"Nicosia's food scene is pretty uninspiring, but The Gym really is exceptional. Generous portions of unusual, fresh, creative food which brings out the best of Cypriot flavors, served in a trendy, high-energy setting. The cocktails were also spectacularly good. Loved it.",The Gym
