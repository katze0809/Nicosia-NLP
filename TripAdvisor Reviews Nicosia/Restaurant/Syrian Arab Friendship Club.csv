50,"We didn't have a reservation but managed to get a table. The meal was just wonderful; it's very big restaurant and you need to be good with that; the service was really attentive and helpful though. There was some dreadful football dross on the TVs while we were there (and there are a lot of TVs) but it strangely seemed quite good and the food was the reason we were there.And the food... oh, the food! I've got shish tawook marinating in the fridge right now because of this place!We loved it. Great food, great service and great atmosphere.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"It's not the first time that I have been to the Syrian Arab Friendship Club and every time, the food has been excellent. Very good quality and very good taste. However, the waiters are a catastrophy. Unfriendly, you see that they don't feel like working, and when you try to order a glass of wine, you have to ask at least three times until they finally bring you what you ordered. An exception is the waiter with the blue shirt, but the young ones with the white shirt are completely useless. A pity, because otherwise, the restaurant is really very good, for both the atmosphere and the food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Our Segway guide, Andros, recommended that we go to this restaurant for dinner. We were not disappointed. There was a wide choice of tasty dishes, from dips and salads to grilled dishes. There was plenty of choice for both meat eaters and vegetarians. They also serve alcohol. Oh and there is both a car park and on street parking.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,This place has the best Syrian/Lebanese dishes to share. Fullstop. Highly recommended. A great place for vegetarians as it has vegetarian meze too.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"My husband and I celebrated my birthday here last night and it was delicious. We regularly make the rounds of Arab restaurants in Nicosia, and this one is still the all around best. (There is one other that has better Fatoush, but everything else in the full meze is better here.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Good food and fast service. Busy on the weekends and especially Sunday lunch time. Portions are generous.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"decent value syrian restaurant with excellent service, mediocre food and affordable prices. apparently they have oriental dance on some occassions",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,"After 20 years of visiting this restaurant I must admit its gone to ****. Prices have gone up by 30% in the last year. Portions have gotten smaller and in essence you end up paying Fish/oriental restaurant prices for a few dips and a kebab. Being a regular, there was always a complimentary tea or coffee and some sweets after food. Prices for coffee and a sweet rivalled a five star hotel.. On the plus the food is fresh (apart from the fried pastry which was frozen inside and the dip which was sitting in the fridge) and if you have never eaten this type of food before you would be pleasantly surprised.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,"Having eaten Middle Eastern including Syrian food for years I looked forward going to this highly reviewed restaurant. Lunch was a disappointment: items seemed not fresh and left over but I thought it because i was eating after normal hours. As music and a belly dancer was scheduled for the week end, I decided to go again. My hotel made reservations for me and said that I was primarily interested in the performance. Therefore I was shocked when I arrived to find that I was being seated where my view would be almost entirely blocked by one of their very large TVs. The waiter initially claimed that the performance takes place through the entire restaurant- but on questioning he confirmed that was not true. I insisted and finally was moved.The food was good but not exceptional- I have had much better elsewhere. The worse was the noise was excessive( large groups shouting to be heard over the loud recorded music)‚Äî several times I thought of leaving but I stayed to see the live performance. Finally more than 1 hour after the ‚Äúscheduled time‚Äù I asked. Turns out the dancer had cancelled hours before!! Guess no dancer, no live music.Were others told? Was I not told because I went alone or because I am a woman or just incompetence?",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"From the time you step in, there is a warm welcome. Everybody is helpful and friendly. The menu is authentic with a selection of the most popular dishes.The meal was excellent and delicious. Just one friendly note. The wine list could be better with some more choices",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Simple and ample. The food is plentiful and comes with a bunch of regional bread and the selection of appetizers is delicious. Suggest trying the chicken liver, if ordering out adding some onions to the side compliments the dish well.I‚Äôd avoid the salads, they are often soggy and a little plain.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Quality and very delicious Syrian Food, Friendly People, Excellent Service, nice atmosphere. Nice Experience.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Food was good and prices even better. Casual and cozy. One of the best places for family to dine in without ripping you off.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This restaurant serves the most spectacular food, so flavoursome and varied. Order the meze and main course selection. The parsley salad is divine and the meats so tender. Finish with a cardamom coffee. I have only awarded four stars as I feel it could be made to feel more authentic, rather mundane with the ordinary tables and table cloths.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Delicious authentic Arabic food ,nice place amazing garden .We visited for dinner and it was really good",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I went recently to the Syrian Friendship Club and was dismayed to see the decor had been totally changed. Modern tables and chairs, bland table cloths No Bedouin tent area, and ghastly VERY LOUD music. What a shame. The food as always was excellent and the staff quick to serve and help but in future we will look for a restaurant with a more authentic atmosphere. A pity.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Clean.Can get overcrowded.Can get too hot, both in the summer and in the winter!Pleasant environment.Based on the mixed/meze menu:Appetisers and spreads are authentic, fresh, expertly prepared and they taste amazing.The two salads are cumulative summaries of more; lettuce salad works, parsley salad is simply out of this world.Grilled meats are uncomplicated but greatly done; skewered marinared chicken and lamb and koftaOverpriced to expensive",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Visited this restaurant last month with family for a lunch over a weekend - Sunday. Nice place, with a big garden. Good tasty Syrian food and very good service.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I have visited this restaurant several times with family and friends, and also have used it‚Äôs takeaway services.

30,"Ordered from here a take away. The place is nice, the staff is helpful and food tastes good. Prior ordering I asked the staff member if the amount of food I‚Äôm ordering is ok for 3 persons, he said yes. The quantity though after receiving was quite small. Was actually for 2 persons. The food is not cheap too.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"This is our second visit in as many days. The food is superb, can‚Äôt fault it in any way,Lunch was the same quality as our evening meal the other day. Just a little quieter which is great. Staff are so attentive and look after you. Highly recommend a visit if you are in Nicosia you won‚Äôt be disappointed I can assure you. I know what I‚Äôm saying about this place is hard to believe. But I can honestly say this place is fantastic and you won‚Äôt find better food anywhere. Best I‚Äôve had. Our meal out was five of us with two bottles of wine and beers total bill was ‚Ç¨133 euros. Not sure of bill today but what a spread.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,I try to visit here every time I am in Nicosia. I have a sentimental attachment to the restaurant and am never disappointed.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,"I am a customer the last years on this restaurant and I was making very often online order... I was making from foody and the minimum order it was 20 euro, this is correct amount for me and they changed it and now is 30 euro the minimum amount..okay I pass this problem and I was calling them directly by.my phone and it was okay they never told me that the minimum order is 30 euro so I was glad to call them and make an order by the phone..I just call them and they told me that the minimum order is 30 euro also by calling them...this is not correct because the last 3 months I was ordering the same exactly food and the same amount I was paying them (less than 30 euro) and now they cannot do something ..I tell them you will lost a customer by doing that but the manager answer to me I cannot do something.. this is wrong policy..if they want 30 euro minimum order they must do it from the beginning from all the ways ...even online orders even by phone directly orders...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Called in one afternooon, without reservation and was warmly greeted, table for 4 for organised and the staff were excellent. they explained the different foods and took the time to go through the menu. Whilst the english wasnt perfect they checked and chatted when asked to explain something. Food was freshly prepared and all served at the correct temprature - no warm or soggy food served here. The prices were extremely reasonable and plenty to go around the table of 4. We choose a wide selection of dishes which were served when ready and they even packed up the remaining items for us to take away! Highly recommended if you want to experience syrian food in a relaxed casual environment. We will return. Thank you",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Interesting restaurant ... somehow old-fashioned but in a place like that you have to pay attention to food mainly and that was definitely tasty. Very good service by the staff ... maybe a little bit too fast -which made some part of the food to become cold too soon ! In any case I liked the atmosphere and I guess that all dishes which arrived on the table were freshly prepared at the time of the order. I know that right now it should be rather a mess to supply wine from Syria ... but I would have appreciated to find in the wine list at least one Syrian label. Anyway I went for an excellent red wine (Porfyros) by Tsiakkas winery (Cyprus). Overall a nice place to be where you can enjoy your meal at a reasonable price.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The reviews about the food here are correct. This was my favourite meal in Cyprus. Portions are large and everything I had was delicious. Given enough time I would have gone back.My only hesitation and negative comment is the smoking. Sides up on a gazebo creates an indoor area guys!! This is more frustrating when the smokers are northern European or from north America; they wouldn't do it at home where it can be enforced.I asked to move when someone out up beside me and staff were accommodating, although surprised by my request. If you are a non-smoker and go before 7pm it will be managed and you'll get great food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,First of all the service from the stuff was perfect. The place could use some renovation. The vegetarian dishes were very tasty. But too much pitta and very poor meat meze for. three. The kebab was just enough for one and a half person. Maybe a little more meat and less bread.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I was invited to a private luncheon for two dozen guests. The plates kept coming... varied and tasty. Something for each and every one, vegetarian and not. Everything was so fresh and obviously prepared at that moment. After sampling a bit of each dish, there still was room for dessert. Surprisingly, these were not overly sweet or cloying. But the real proof of a good restaurant comes when a couple of hours later you have digested your meal so well that you are almost hungry again. Efficient a and discrete service.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"It's a good choice for day out. Different food from other restaurants, good choice and good atmosphere. Excellent service.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I had dinner at this restaurant with a group of friends on a recent trip to Cyprus. It is a Syrian restaurant in a suburb of Nicosia. For a starter, I had Shawander (a beetroot, tahini and yoghurt dip) with pitta bread. My main course was Shish Tawouk (seasoned chicken pieces) with salad. Both courses were delicious - in my opinion, the best food we had on our stay.This would be a five star review but for one slightly irritating feature. Like most of the diners, we were seated in the smoking area of the restaurant, which may technically have been exempt from the smoking ban in Cyprus but was a covered area which appeared to be enclosed. The ventilation was fairly good, but the smell of cigars and shisha was noticeable while we were eating. There was also a non-smoking room, but only one table was being used there. We should have been asked whether we wanted to eat in the smoking or non-smoking area.Despite this blemish, I would certainly eat here again if I was in Nicosia.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,"We were waiting one hour in order to bring us our order! Also, we order drinks and desert and they never brought them but they included them in the bill.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I visited Syrian Arab Friendship with my family last month. The food is mainly Arabic cuisine with a huge variety of plates. I suggest meze menu. Prices are surprisingly low and the service is super. I visited this place several times and was never disapointed. A separate lounge for shisha is also available.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Very nice and different tastes. Excellent service and friently staff. The only negative is the price. 18 euro per person for Syrian meze and 4 euro for the desert is extremely expensive.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Even in Winter we were able to sit outside because there were heaters everywhere! Amazing syrian food and desserts.I recommend to get the falafel and the machallepi. The waitresses were really friendly and they served the food quickly.You should go at least once and try this amazing food!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,Frequent visitor you know what to expect above average food good selection of dips . Excellent choice for vegetarians,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We went there 6 of us (children and adults) for a borthday party and the food was just beautiful, the meat was better than in many other places, and the service perfect. Portions as usual in Cyprus nearly too big (food waste...) but everything tasteful from the mezeto thebreadand all dishes. Not to miss.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The people of Cyprus and the people of Syria always had friendly relations; the restaurant ""Syrian Arab Friendly Club"" in Nicosia has expanded the existing friendship to the field of good and traditional Arabian food.This restaurant serves the excellent tastes of Syria in Cyprus.

Don't miss it, if you want to taste the Syrian traditional food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,Food was amazing as always. I found the dessert not as good though. Also the atmosphere was lacking that ‚Äúnice relaxing touch‚Äù. A nice refurbishment would help eg change chairs.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

20,"The food was definitely not out of the ordinary for MIddle Eastern cuisine, we have eaten better at other Syrian restaurants in Limassol. I would not recommend this place it is way too vast for a start and the menu is suspiciously large.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Perfect food at a reasonable price, lovely atmosphere and service, been going there for a rather long time and the quality remains unchanged. love it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,From 2009 i went there about 30 times. They have the same tasty good value food all those years. Very good service and value for money. Keep the good work guys üòâ,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

20,I‚Äôve been there with a big group of friends and I wasn‚Äôt impressed by the food or the atmosphere. The food did not taste bad but it was not interesting. Because I‚Äôve been to other syrian restaurants in nicosia the other ones had much more tasty food. And the atmosphere has nothing that says ‚Äúsyrian‚Äù. Nothing arabic in it. So not my favorite syrian restaurant in Nicosia.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I've never try the Syrian cuisine in Cyprus, expect when i visited Syria, so my first visit in this restaurant surprise me positively...A lot of dishes to choose from (meat and vegeteranian) and reasonable prices.

50,have been there with friends for diner all the dishes were very good and the prices were reasonable will go there again,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,"Authentic Syrian dishes, nice and friendly environment. Reasonable prices and good service. Provides a convenient parking space. It is a weekly destination for a good lunch or dinner.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We went on a Sunday night and had a fantastic meal. We had read the meze was for a minimum of 2 people ( we get it because of the work involved) but we are light eaters and these meals are huge. We saw it served to the couple next to us and they loved it but only ate a third. So we ordered one grilled chicken, humas, and the spicy red dip. So let me say the pita bread is the best I have ever tasted. I will be dreaming about it for years to come! The humas was outstanding and so was the spicy red dip( it had pomegranates but I cannot remember the name. The house wine was reasonable and enjoyable, the staff attentive and it is our best meal yet. There is a reason this restaurant is rated so high and I wish we had more opportunities to dine here. The ambiance was nice too!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The food is always amazing. menu is helpful with what to choose, as it has fotos and detailed descriptions. meze is 15euro and is a loooot of food.other choices are quit cheap too. It comes with a bunch of delicious arabic pitta.One downside is that they serve and charge for water without asking. I personally complained and they said is on the house but they still charged for it!!!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Its a place I visit very often with family and friends, the food its very tasteful! Service its excellent and prices are really good!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,We went to this place a few days ago. The food was very delicious and tasty and the waiters very polite. We really enjoyed the belly dancer who was dancing quite long comparing to other belly dancers in similar restaurants. The only problem was that although we were sitting outside it was very hot compared to the temperature in the street.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Used to love this place and was a very regular customer but stopped going after watching standards drop. After a year-long break I ordered a take-away tonight. The shish taouk was well over-cooked (burned to black in places), and the tabbouleh salad was swimming in oil. The bread was stone cold and tasted like it came out of the oven hours earlier.On tonight's experience I will have to find another Syrian/Lebanese restaurant for my ""fix"" or just stick to traditional Cypriot kebab which is both cheaper and more consistent.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"As an alternative to the usual local restaurants or taverns, this place offers a well cooked middle east traditional food. A good place to enjoy food on special occasions with friends and family",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Nice place and good food. The staff is friendly. There are many traditional foods which you can try. The place has shisha also.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,The food is always good Standard quality of Syrian cuisine Spicy as expected I have visited the place many times and I am always satisfied Nargile smoking at the end is a highlight,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"This is a fantastic place to grab lunch or dinner in Nicosia. The food is so tasty, especially with the home-made pitta they provide. The setting is nice, but it is recommended that you reserve a table in the evening, especially at the week-end.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,"a nice atmosphere especially during the summer, good food, if you like to taste the Arab kitchen is the right place the prices are high",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"After reading several reviews for this place we decided to come here for an evening meal on Sunday, but being wary as we have never tried Syrian food before we only ordered one starter each and one mixed grill. We thoroughly enjoyed the felafel and the fried bulgar wheat stuffed with minced lamb starters and were really pleased with the mixed grill. I tried the Syrian sweets, but they don't look like the picture on the menu and for me, they were not quite crunchy or light enough. I prefer the ones I had in an Israeli Arab village several years ago and have never found any to be quite as good.That said, we decided to come back again the following evening and really went to town on the order, making our own mezze, in effect: felafel, hummus, spinach pies, and lamb sausages, two different salads, chicken kebabs and lamb kebabs: all thoroughly enjoyable but definitely a case of eye bigger than stomach. No worries: the remainder was packed up for us to take away for tomorrow's lunch. I did manage to find room for the Syrian ice cream which was really good but very different from any ice cream I have had before (& we're both retired!).If ever we return to Nicosia, we'll definitely be sure to revisit this establishment!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"Visited this restaurant with friends earlier this month and was very very pleased with the quality of the food on offer.Plenty of dishes to choose from if you don‚Äôt fancy the set menu‚Äôs they do one dish which name escapes me but has walnut and pomegranate molasses which is too die for and their breads are incredible.Not the easiest place to find if you are a tourist as it‚Äôs quite tucked away but well worth the effortIf your staying in central Nicosia then jump a cab it wouldn‚Äôt cost a lot, you will be pleased you did once you taste the food",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"In this restaurant we enjoyed the quality of the food, the wine and the belly dancing but not the aesthetic that reminds restaurant in busy bus station and the portions. The portions are totally unbalanced. We were three vegans and we ordered three ""vegan meze"" portions. The price of the vegan meze (meze means some of many different plates) was good but the portions were unbelievably small. They served only one piece of falafel per portion! So three falafel one for each person. That was very miserable. The belly dancing was a nice surprise and saved the night.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Excellent mezze and beautiful ambiance. Too hot however due to high temperature heaters.Good selection of mezze plates with lots of dips salads and tender meats. Beautiful. Expect 15-20‚Ç¨ per person for full mezze and a drink (or two).Original Syrian cuisine with bread made on site in traditional wood stove.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,I am visiting the Syrian Friendship Club since the early nineties when it was only frequented by Syrian expatriates. The food was excellent and very original at extremely reasonable prices ! I am happy to say that today the food continues to be of excellent quality and still very original despite the fact that since then has become a regular commercial restaurant !,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Amazing taste of all mezze that we have tried. Definitely the restaurant has wooden grill, as all the meat and aubergine had nice smokey smell. Big restaurant, a bit missing atmosphere (my visit was during lunch time) but food delicious and friendly waiter.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"Past experience has shown that the Syrian Arab friendship club at 17 Queen Amalia‚Äôs Street in Nicosia is a first class restaurant, offering really delicious Syrian dishes. Hence, it was our first choice for a family Sunday lunch.The place was decorated in a nice, restraint Arabic way and was very clean. The atmosphere was very tranquil being conducive to a relaxed meal.We booked a table ‚Äì a wise move given the popularity of the place ‚Äì for three, three days in advance; the booking was a hassle-free process.We ordered Kebab Kafta, Shish Tawouk and Shukaf, plus Fattoush (traditional Syrian salad topped with crunchy pita bread and pomegranate dressing). All the dishes were delicious: nicely cooked, very well presented and very tasty; what is more the quantity was enough to fill even the biggest stomach!After the meal we were served a variety of sweets that were a treat from the vendor.Furthermore, service was excellent and the prices very affordable.We truly look forward to having a meal at the Syrian Arab friendship club again and again!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"first time having a Syrian meze,,,great tasting simple food no frills or ribbons just the way it should be served authentic and fresh. pricing was very reasonable with pleasant friendly staff all staff we dealt with had time to chat and exchange a few words even though the place was very busy.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,We went to this restaurant several times. Last time was for a birthday. We ordered the meze which is at a very good price. It includes the most characteristic dishes so you need no more. At some point a traditional dancer makes her appearance so most men look at her instead of the food during that time!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Huge terrace , with lot of threes around.Restaurant outside entry fantastic like antiques replicas and they have a full menu for all type of appetite..will experience it again..",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,Nice traditional place. Good service. Decent food. A little heavy for my taste but overall good. Nice refreshing deserts,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,The food is excelent i tottaly recommend it the prices are good. I will advice you to check the receipt before you pay they often make mistakes,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This restaurant if open 365 days a year. It serves Arabic food and it is very tasty. There is also a take away and delivery service. You can order the meze and get a variety of salads, dips and meat dishes or if your prefer order a la cart. The portions are generous, the salads are made with fresh ingredients. For dessert try the Lebanese Mahallepi, it is my favorite.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Syrian restaurant has been offering over two decades excellent value proposition. Despite the fact that there was an accident during our last visit where a waiter accidentally poured three cokes from the tray next to one of our guests it was managed ok and the whole lunch went very well. Tried their lachmajou for the first time and it is a good try. Only disappointment is their sweets which in my opinion need to be improved.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Was nearby the hotel and was recommended by the staff thereGood Middle Eastern foodSet Menus most value as they bring out lots of dips with flat breads and then let a lot of meat especially lamb kebabs etc.Atmosphere was nice and staff was friendly but the service was a bit slowRecommend,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Visited this restaurant in several occasions and we never regreted it! Food is always fresh and in big quantities! For sure try the mezze and dont forget the Lamp Arayes and the boneless chicken dish!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I‚Äôm working in Cyprus for a few days and a local colleague recommended this place. I am so glad he did! The food was amazing. Fresh and tasty. The lightest flatbreads ever. A delicious mouhamarah dip. Very flavoursome and tender chicken shish tawouk and a beautiful fattoush salad. I barely had room for the dessert I was given, but it was so lovely I somehow managed most of it. Can‚Äôt recommend this place highly enough.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Have visited many times throughout the years, always maintains a relatively high standard, nowadays the traditional meze has become a bit too standardized, there is lack of enthusiasm and the desert (mahalebia) was definitely not up to par. My humble suggestion to management is to become a bit more eager, to step in with a new dish perhaps...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Have eaten from here a couple times, ordered delivery for work and the food orders was great except the salad which was loaded in oils and soggy...Each time we ordered delivery, either the order was wrong or they forgot something and we had to wait...all 7 times actually...Food is however delicious and the restaurant I hear is worth a visit...try it out and leave a comment",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Easy to park which is always a good beginning. We ate inside but since there were no sides in position it was partly outside as well I guess. Service was excellent. We didn't feel like a starter so we moved immediately to lamb kebabs and an extremely good. well dressed salad accompanied by two large bottles of Keo beer. The kebabs were delicious. It's very good food and extraordinarily good value.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
10,"In the quest of halal resturant, we opted for Syrain Arab friendship club. We ordered lamb kababs and marinated chicken boneless.Our ordered arrived and I reached for kababs. And when i tried the kabab right in the middle of it I spotted a FLY.It was there, grilled with the kabab i guess.We called the waiter, astonished as he was, he tried to give justification and took the plate away.We called for bill and went away.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"We had a wonderful eating experience here. We went with another family and were all extremely satisfied with the food we had. There was PLENTY of it, so hold back on placing a big order, you can always ask for me as you go. All dishes we sampled were extremely tasty. My only complaint would be smoking! - both hubba-bubba pipes and regular cigarettes are allowed in any area of the restaurant. We were sat next to a chain smoking table which did prompt us to cut our evening a bit short, but tbh, we were so stuffed, we didn't have room for any desert!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"If you‚Äôre in Nicosia you really must come here. The food is spectacular.The shared Meze is ¬£15 per person. (Min of 2 people) Travelling solo, it‚Äôs normally not possible but I was lucky with my waiter and he arranged a starter of four dips & then a mix of chicken & lamb grill.Everything was so perfectly cooked and full of flavour. I would definitely return. The lighting is a bit harsh so the restaurant is not fancy but come for the superb food!!The table next to me couldn‚Äôt finish their food and were given taken away containers.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Hi All, I went to the restaurant as part of our team engagement post our full day workshop. The restaurant was selected purely based upon being Halal serving. We had most of Muslim friends hence we were there. The food portions were big, quite a big menu and a lot to explore. Alcohol serving was putting a bit doubt on the food being Halal as posted by some of our colleagues but restaurant staff assured that its an authentic Halal restaurant. Overall good engagement with the team thanks.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The restaurant always keeps up with its good reputation. They bring fresh arabic meze, salads, dips and meat, charge very reasonable prices, and the waiters are always friendly. Last time I went, they even had a belly dance show. I will always highly recommend them because they deserve it.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Everything is perfect! Excellent food, excellent atmosphere and excellent service!! The staff are very friendly and proffessional. The prices also are very reasonable. I strongly recommend it for visiting it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Good restaurant with a nice open yard.Fast good service.You can choose from set menu or make your own mezze. Dips and salads are excellent. Meat dishes are small quantity but still delicious.Prices moderate due to the food quantity.They could offer the desert and not charge it too, or even offer coffee.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This restaurant is living proof that ingredient quality, taste of food and service is over and above restaurant decor. Atmosphere here is created by faithful happy customers enjoying excellent food and good service. We wanted seconds of everything! Good place for vegetarians too. We will go back again and again.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Very nice place, a bit of an extravagant decor in line with the style. Food always the same good quality and standard, with little deviation. Staff is welcoming and polite, and service is quick and to the point.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Went here to escape the scorching midday sun. Nice setting and service very prompt. Excellent selection of dips with falafel and chess roll starter. Plenty of wonderful lifts bread to mop up hummous, baba ganoush and so on.Meze completed with meat platter - good meat but kebab meat a little dry. My companions had some Syrian coffee which they really enjoyed and 2 of them had the mahallepi which was delicious. Well worth a visit - the difficulty is eating a large meal in that heat.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"great syrian food, nice atmosphere, one of the better known syrian restaurants in cyprus. worth a visit for genuine syrian food",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"The ambiance is lovely, we sat outside and it was decorated well.However, unfortunately it wasn't as expected, we ordered a meze, the food tasted good but when it came to the meat part it was very disappointing with a very small amount of meat in each of the dishes, definitely not enough for 6 adults, so we had to order more dishes.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The place has got a unique ambience, you could even call it ""cult"". Great service, very tasty food, large portions and excellent value for money. Don't miss it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Excellent syrian food with nice atmosphere. Highly recommended. Give it a try and order the meze....,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Authentic tastes.Extensive spread of optionsA bit too hot during the summer monthsI would appreciate a menu option of meze with half the currently offered appetizers, one salad instead of two and 25% more mains (meats)CleanAmbience could have been betterSpace looks like it was put together in a hasteVery limited parking spaces",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I have been here a few times and the food has always been excellent. Delicious dishes, lovely environment, excellent service. It is a favourite.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Authentic delicious Syrian Cuisine at its best,an amazing array of dishes to tantalise your tastebuds and the fresh deserts are to die for, my favourite was the Mahalebi with rose syrup",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Amazing food with always the same excellent quality!! All dishes are delicious and prices are great! Would recommend it to anyone.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,The food is good. And is not fusion at all. It looks and tastes traditional. I have tried the mezzes (meat) and many salads. The salads and the dips there are very nice. In terms of meat the lamb is my favorite. Juice and tasty. Worth a visit if you like this type of food.One of the things that have a lot of room for improvement is the deco. It needs a good refresh i think.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The BT Curry Club has relocated to Nicosia, Cyprus.The first venue visited, on Saturday 22 July, was the interesting sounding Syrian Arab Friendship Club, located in the quiet western suburbs of Nicosia. It is a welcoming oasis in the suburban streets near the US, Russian an Egyptian embassies.We were warmly welcomed and offered a pleasant table in the atmospheric, even though a little artificial, surroundings.Not being so familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine, we ordered simply with a selection of meze and mixed grill main course. Listed below are the scores in our usual format:Location: 3.5/5Service: 3.5/5Cleanliness: 3.5/5Atmosphere: 3.5/5Value: 4.5/5Drinks: 3.5/5Starters: 4.0/5Mains: 4.0/5Overall Score: 7.5/10The quality of the food was good and the value for money excellent. We will be back and perhaps be more adventurous on our next food selection.That said, the BT Curry Club recommends the Syrian Arab Friendship Club and will definitely return.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"As far I was told, lovers of Syrian food go to this ethnic restaurant in Nicosia. So, we did! 45 minutes drive from Larnaca we were there. We avoided to order the ""meze"" menu as we are familiar with the Arabic cuisine so we order a selection of starters and dishes we preferred. Everything was very tasty and well cooked. After dinner, we had our dessert accompanied by nargile. I recommend it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,If you like Lebanese or Syrian food this is the place to go the prices are very reasonable and you can get a good selection of food to choose from. The service you get is rather sometimes disappointing.My favorite dish is the Chicken Kebab which is very well marinated and probably the best i have tasted until now.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,First of all is a very cheap restaurant with very good and quality food. We enjoy every bite of it. authentic syrian cuisine,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,"After visited other Syrian places we found its food poor...Their vegetarian meze (9 euros per person) had only 2 salads, 5 dips, 2 falafels, 2 cheese sticks and the some pitta... The pitta was not fresh, the dips you couldn't tell easy what they were as they had very mild taste and wasn't something special...their falafel wasn't something special also, we had much better elsewhere... In overall, for such a vegetarian friendly cuisine, their meze was very poor and not great...Another thing we didn't like it was that when you sit they bring you a bottle of water, for each you pay for it later (2 euros), without ordering it or want it...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,We have visited the restaurant on a number of occasions and have always found the service and the food to be very good. Recently used their efficient delivery service.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Traditional Syrian/ Arab food, great taste good quality. went with other 2 families (6* 7 kids), and enjoyed the food although ate a bit too much.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I strongly recommend having a dinner at this restaurant Nice presentation of food, friendly staff and extra good food",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,I felt like the waiter was abit cold and impolite but the food was worth the bad service. Enjoyed the salads and the chicken was decent too.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"I wish some one explained to us about food. As it was our first visit we took their suggestion of FULL MEZE!WHAT A DISSAOINTMENT!One salad after the other, tones of bread..... when the meat came we asked them to put most of it in a take away box!I will never do it again unless I am with friends from Syria.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"This restaurant offers a good option for casual dining or take away. Being that I spend half of my time in Arab countries I am a rather strict judge when it comes to Arab cuisine which I love! So food here is average, tabouleh needs improvement in recipe and cut!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"went on Sunday for lunch.Rather crowded, but that was not a problem because the service was very efficient and friendly.The food excellent, fresh salads,tasty dips and grilled meats cooked to perfection.Prices reasonable too.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Whilst the waiters were slightly too inattentive for my liking they were fine and in fairness i did i have reasons not to be hanging around too long but if you're happy to have a leisurely meal you couldn't go wrong than eat here. Decor is interesting in a themepark type way but fun and inviting.The food though is the star of the show. Its really good and great value for money. Mixed grill was really good and relatively cheap.I'd definitely recommend going here,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Tucked away in a quiet street, this is a real gem. Equally cosy during the day and at night it offers first class food. This is just right in terms practically everything",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Good tasting and quality food at good prices. Great place to take family. Service fast and polite. Try anything from grilled.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"If you like trying out Middle Eastern cuisine then this is the place to go to. We ordered the meze for two and it would have fed four people! The food was great and such a diverse variety of food, also good for those that are not to keen on meat! Initially, I did not think the waiters were friendly but I think it is a language barrier. It offers a very relaxed atmosphere where if you keen on shisha you can enjoy that too! We finished the evening with complimentary Syrian desserts and a drink.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"We went on a Saturday evening, and initially it was lovely. It's possible to order vegetarian mezedes, and everything tasted interesting and good. However, the service was slow even by local standards, and then they suddenly turned on some very loud music for belly dancers. My advice would be to go, but if it's a Saturday, go early enough that you can skip the loud music.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We are just back from a trip to Cyprus. We spend three nights in Nicosia and of those we are here two nights. The food was delicious, it was a vegetarian heaven. It was also very child friendly. The staff were friendly and very helpful and it was reasOnably priced. It was a little difficult to find but def. worth the effort I would go back again",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,people enjoy the place for the friendly atmosphere and good tasty food. meat complemented with fresh green vegetables and Syrian bread,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This is a meze restaurant which like most of this type offers a huge selection of small plates, bowls and platters of really some of the best appetizers one can imagine. The local is in south Nicosia in a neighborhood. The interior setting is festive and ornate with efficient waiters who are prompt and kind. The food is decidedly a blend of Cypriot and Arabic including 2 huge bowls of salads,all the usual meze dips and a more than ample selection of grilled meats to savor.I would suggest ordering 1 less meze than the number of guest since there is so much great food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Nice location, quiet erea but close to Nicosia center. Very nice food with a big variety in the menu. Tasty bread. Excellent service and quick. Nice belly dancing. A good place for family night out. We had a great break from routine.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,First time here and we would go back. It is the fairly traditional middle eastern fair with fresh herb salads and grilled meats.We did not realise it but smoking was allowed which was a bit strange so when the bloke on the next table lit up a cigar everyone got a whiff.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Tablecloth stains, wobbly chairs, old-fashioned china and an outdated d√©cor manifest that the time has come for the restaurant to be refurbished. The above are eye-catching and if you are the kind of people who pays attention these, you won't give it one more shot.With respect to food, that's ok; no fireworks.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We visited the restaurant with our friends and ordered the Meze. The food was spot on, delicious and the price was reasonable. The staff were very friendly which made the experience even more fun. I would recommend this restaurant for a nice night out.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
10,"Invited our friends to this restaurant, as we read a lot of positive reviews about it. Booked a table. Staff was very impolite right from the start. We ordered shishas and some of us ordered food. After couple of minutes waiters came to us again and said that we need to order more in order to stay. They (!) did not ask us to do it politely and were very rude. We were shocked by it. Some of us even were not hungry and we rejected to order more. They told us to go to another table, so not to occupy this one in smoking area.Then the food. It was far not the best in Cyprus. Portions are small, compared to other places, and not really well-made. Shisha was bad as well. We had to ask for the bill twice and we could not pay it for around 25 minutes, as their card machine was not working. The waiter was very angry and he forgot that we are also wasting our time because of their problems. The impressions left from this place are awful. Better choose something else to have a good time.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"we had an early dinner according to Cypriot standards, around 19.00 and the restaurant was almost empty but it started filling up later on. we tried the meze for 2, everything was delicious, i especially enjoyed the hummus and the salads.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

10,We ordered the meze for two. The food was very little based on the money we gave. Also the food quality was really bad. I wouldn't recommend it,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,Great place to dine in Nicosia. Has a unique ambience and excellent cuisine and is probably the best Syrian restuaranin in Cyprus.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,A pseudo-authentic feel of Middle Eastern culture in Cyprus. The meze spread is diverse and friendly for meat lover and veggies alike.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I have been to the Syrian Friendship twice this past month. I can never have enough of it. The food is great, the waiters extra helpful, the atmosphere is lovely and the prices are excellent.

I'd definitely recommend dining here and will endeavour to return when I'm next in Nicosia.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"A really hearty and festive variety of plates from Syrian cuisine, including salads, meat, and falafel, as well as pitta bread. Tip: Order the potatoes on top of the meze, they are really that good. You can stay longer and enjoy your narghile / shisha, and don't say no to the mahalepi (lebanese/syrian) dessert. A truly enjoyable experience, and very friendly service, for the lovers of good and honest food!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I read about the restuarant while visiting Nicosia. As syrian living in barcelona i was craving for authentic syrian food. The menu is rich and not pricy. We ordered mezze (taboole,kebbe naye,kebbe makleye, humus, muhamara) and arayes. Evrything was so yummy. Big portions. Yumy arabic bread. Delicious pickles. The staff are very nice. Very generous restuarant.You have to try it if you are in town and escape cyprus food to syrian taste.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,It took us a while to locate the restaurant but well worth the treck.

40,Great food and great place! You should try it. I hope they dont use MSG as I always get heart pulpitations after eating there. I want to believe that they are caused by the amount of food I try there. Expensive for Cyprus standards by the way.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This is a very special place the decoration of which may surprise: one part recreates the syrian tent, another is made of bricks and another is the patio with trees around. The food is excellent; there is plenty of it. The staff is nice and very quick. If you want to try a shisha, there is a space outside the restaurant where they will prepare it for you",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This place is great! We got 12 dishes of various items, each one expertly prepared and delicious. Charming set up with real and fake trees, but somehow it works. Attentive staff, including a bread maker. Get the meze ( huge number of pre-set appetizers) then add a couple dishes of things you really like. We loved the eggplant with pomegranate sauce. The meze for two was enough for four people. We went home with enough food for the whole next day. It's was a fun and delightful experience. On top of that, it was very inexpensive. My daughter enjoyed the hookah. The Syrian coffee and ice cream were also enjoyable.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,Never dissapointed. All food is freshly prepared. Shish tawouk is a must. We usually order meze. Service is efficient and food is brought out quickly.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The food variety is not so good, as they mainly have dips. We tried 6 or 7 different dips , but very little quantity of meat. The quality of the meat was superb but the quantity was very little. All this at the price of 15 euros per person is abit overpriced. They should add a little more meat.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Very good stuffed wine leaves and humus with grilled lamb as starter. Grilled lamb and bread as main course. Cyprian coffee and Syrian sweets were offered for free. Water is complementary. Excellent value for 18 EUR.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I have been many times to the SAFC and I think their vegetarian meze is wonderful. My visitors always enjoy everything from meze to kebabs and I will likely continue to go there. However, the atmosphere could be so much better with very basic tweaks!! Turn the lights down!! It's like a cafeteria in there. A little ambiance lighting would go a long way.Order the walnut and pomegranate dip -- it is to die for! But avoid the dolmas/stuffed grape leaves. They are always soggy and flavorless, and I've given up ordering them.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Once you visit here, you will do again. A nice, warm place. Good service and not expensive. The food is tasty and gives many options. The atmosphere is nice",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"Visited Limassol for a week and went here on a recommendation from a local. It is tucked away in a back street just off the main strip, but really easy to find. The restaurant is very relaxed and quite an attractive place to sit during a meal, the food is spectacularly good, so much so that we went twice in the week that we were there! There is a LOT of food in a meze for 2, and they were more than happy to box up the remainders to take away",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We go all the time!!! The quality and the value for money you get it s the best in town. Salads are fresh and tasty, the chicken taouk excellent and all bbq meats are excellent. Bread is freshly baked on the spot. Strongly recommended!!? Fridays and sats they gave belly dancers performing. Do try their deserts and ice cream and have their white coffee !!!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Quality and great service at rediculously low price. Been visiting for years and no drop in either!!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I go to the Syrian Arab Friendship club very often. The food is amazing you cannot go wrong with the classics (hummus, muhammara, tabbouleh etc) they are always delicious and fresh.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This is a Syrian restaurant with a very complete menu. If you enjoy arabic food as much as I do, then it's a must visit when you're in Nicosia. Plus it's not expensive. the only downside is the decor which is a bit of flisntones, not very comfortable chairs and huge tables. Not cosy, but good food for good money.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,It has become a family tradition to visit the Syrian Friendship Society Restaurant every time I visit Cyprus. The food is consistently high quality as is the service. Meze is 15 euros per person and is more than one can eat. Eight of you? Order 6 or 7 meze.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Visited the place with my husband and another couple who are vegan. This is one of the few places where you can get some very good options for vegans!The music is a bit too loud (has been loud over the past couple of times we've visited during the past 3 months).Food quality was good and service was very good as always, even though they missed on a plate we ordered. They might just need some fine tuning :)",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"A pleasant, traditional environment (perhaps the music is a bit louder than necessary). Good service. A very rich menu, several different choices (incl.meze: variety of different dishes) and average prices. Delicious sauces and dips, large tasty salads and a great mix grill make for a delicious experience.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Pleasant staff and atmosphere, excellent good and value for money. Plenty of space so not usually necessary to book ahead, but do it anyway. The dips, bread and little pies are especially good. Don't over-order and do try the fatoush salad.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Great place to visit! Nice atmosphere, live entertainment and great food! Small dishes can be ordered to taste a variety of choices.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The best Syrian food in Cyprus. Always high quality, fast and friendly service. The Syrian restaurant is one of my favourites for casual dining at an affordable price. Big place so no need for reservation. Highly recommended for any occasion!!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Big variety of Middle East dishes including salads and grilled meat ,well cooked and presented well priced.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The whole experience is 5 star. Staff are so welcoming and helpful, the service is prompt. The food is best quality and presented well. There is only a small menu choice BUT if you want different then so be it. Have been eating here for over 14 years and keep going back...which tells you ? yes its worth it",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"The food is good, The Nergila/Shisha need to be better, we also had bad experience with the shisha service. shisha charcoals are very bad, music is same and old its good to change the playlist :)",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Tasty interesting menu, good variety of dishes, nice decor, relaxing atmosphere, maybe a little pricy for some, but worth a visit",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Fresh, well prepared food, rich taste must go for the meze. The dips are magic. It is already an old venue that has managed to hold on to superb quality and fair prices. It might be an uncomfortable place to sit in, in the hottest part of the year, but still worth the visit.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Sit, relax, eat, have a shisha and eat your mahalepia. A touch of deferense in nicosia. A pkace that brings memmories to those who love the deferend.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,The Oriental food is well depicted here with all its parameters You can't go wrong here with the choice of food Highly recommended,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,Consistently good food quality. Meze is the top pick for me at 15 euro - value for money. Drinks and desserts are expensive. Local beer at 5 euro and plain ice cream at 4.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This is one of our favorite places in Nicosia. They are a bit slow with service, but the food is excellent to our taste and the atmosphere is relaxed. It is a simple place and a good option to come with children.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,"As a vegetarian there was nothing except the fatoush salad ( which was greek salad with pitta bread, no spices no Lebanese/ Syrian taste) and aubergines. The dips were poor and tasteless. Disappointed",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Each time we visited the restaurant (3 or 4 times so far), the food was delicious and abundant. Grilled meat is extremely tasty, but plenty of choices for vegetarians as well. Take the meze - you won't be disappointed.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,A place you can enjoy genuine arabic food. Very good service and nice environment.You can enjoy narghile as well.The prices are very reasonable.Cost around ‚Ç¨15-‚Ç¨18 per person wine included.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I took a recommendation from a friend to try this outdoor restaurant in Nicosia. From the time you arrive until the time you leave you can see that the place is full of energy and the waiters are on standby to fulfill all your culinary wishes.As for the prices more than decent for such a service and the food brings back memories of the old.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,This is one of the places we love in Nicosia. It used to be inexpensive too!!! Now the prices got up but the food is great if you like spicy but not hot food.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Nice food, interesting dips and side dishes. The meat is also very tasty, marinated and tender! Very nice desserts as well!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Great food and service at a very reasonable price. Come as you are no dinner jacket required. The humus is outstanding and the lamb is fresh.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,when i am entertaining friends this is always my go to restaurant. The food is authentic and the people there are so friendly and you feel like home... Usually I cant even get past the appetisers and that perfectly roasted pitta bread (fresh every day) but i always try to leave some room for dessert Friendly service best resturant in nicosia,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I had been with my family at this place the food was great the waiters was fantastic great place I advice everybody to visit great atmosphere.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
10,"Avoid this place . We were the first ones in the restaurant. 5 of us. They sat us at an awful location. Mot was hot, humid and I had a fan blowing on me the entire time. The waiter was unfriendly. 2 menus for 5 people. We were basically ignored for much of the meal. And to top it off, my wife had glass in her dessert, I guess it was the manager whomcamemto apologize and tell it that such things happen. Well maybe in Syria they do. And if such things happen, make good. They still charged usmformthendessert. We have been in Cyprus for 3 months now. Tried dozens of restaurants all over. This was the worst.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"This restaurant offers wide range of very tasty dips and two most popular salads. Meat portions are small in size ( to compare with other restaurants ) if you order meze. The more you order the lesser you get! I had meze few times and we got similar size meals for two and for four persons. Service is good and atmosphere is typical for this kind of restaurants. I think sometimes is better to order separate dishes, at least you will have chance to try different things.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,I would give 5 stars if I was a fun of that kind of cuisine. The quality was good and they provide a lot of variety. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very good as well.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"For oriental food lovers this is the ideal place to satisfy your good apetite. Beleive me the apetisers and side dishes are more delicious than the main food. Don't forget to order Muhammarah, and falafel!! Reasonable prices!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,The food was Excellent. The traditional drinks were perfect. The atmosphere was very good. Finally nargile was amazing.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"An amazing place to be at! Food is delicous! The variety is remarkable! So many foods to choose from! I would suggest if a big company , get a meze for everyone! It contains a variety of salads, always freshly made, with a great dressing for every of it! Moreover the meat is just perfect! Again a huge variety to choose from! Everything was just delicous! A perfect quiet atmoshpere to be involved in! Was there more than 20 times and was satisfied at all of them! This restaurant gets a 5*!!!!!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Always fresh meat, very friendly and hospitable approach by all staff! Delicious and a variety of Syrian cousine dishes available! Highly recommended!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"For everyone who craves Middle Eastern cousin this is the place to go as it serves the food at its best version. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, food taste and quality always amazing and consistent prices are very reasonable. Don't miss out!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"An amazing array of vegetarian dips, dishes and salads along with various kebabs that melt in your mouth, complimented by genuine pitta bread, made right there. The feast is completed with Mahallepi, Baklava and Syrian coffee. Very friendly staff in a traditional environment, topped on Saturday nights with a live belly dancer. One of our favorite restaurants for Sunday lunch as well.They lost the fifth star because the prices went up a little bit lately, however the overall pricing is still quite descent. With moderate drinking expect to pay around 20 Euros per person.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"A really good place with good food, a big variety of food. Great environment and good service. They also serve shisha if you want to try.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Best Syrian food in town, try the Syrian meze and definitely ask for desert. Average prices. Typical Syrian decoration.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,One of my favourite places in Nicosia. Lovely environment and amazing food. Quick service and very good prices for what it offers.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Nothing new or special here. They turn out the same food, in the same old, jaded environment. the whole place needs a serious facelift. Even the belly dancer, gyrating to music so loud that conversation became impossible, looked bored. But the food is ok, and plenty of it",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Nice food, lot of variety, humus, falafel , spicy chicken, nice spicy lamp, the kebab was not so good. Nice atmosphere , nice garden, good service.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Especially on Saturdays is very nice with the belly dancer. And the food too especially the bread(pittes)!!!!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Good food, fair pricing, decent service, pleasant surroundings. Would have given the place 5 stars except the server was not that helpful and we had to guess what we were ordering. But we liked it and we do recommend the restaurant.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,Not super not even very good. Just fine. The price and quality equal. Big and long menu to chose between. I just give 5 of 10,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Have been there several times and I have no complaints the houmous is very good also the lamp kebab try the arak with your meal instead of wine or beer. Have not been there recently also the service is perfect,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Great meze for a filling lunch. The quantity is always leading, per norm in Cyprus, but the food was nevertheless delicious, esp the tabbouleh, taouk and lamb shish",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Syrian used to be a top favourite for us. In the past few years though it has become too ""commercial"" and this has come at the expense of the uniqueness of experience that we previously felt.We used to go to Syrian Arab Friendship at least once, often twice a week with the whole family. What we have experienced in the last couple of years was an improvement in the seating and dining space (larger, more elaborately decorated) but a comparative deterioration of the overall experience.Don't take me wrong; it still servers decent food but the prices have steadily been increasing with no corresponding improvement in the offered dishes. The waiters continue to be reasonably attentive, even though they are not as friendly as they used to be.All in all, after visiting again following a rather long spell of choosing not to, I didn't get that special feeling and Syrian hospitality which this place was known for......",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Very tasty Arab food. Beautiful and young expert belly dancer but only danced only for a few minuits. Smoking area is excellent and open-air with nargile service,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"We enjoyed meze for 2 on a Saturday evening. Friendly service, delicious food, good value for money (always big portions). Popular with locals. Separate smoking, non smoking area. Authentic atmosphere. Shishe & bellydancer, lovely garden. Will be back againüëå",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,i am fan of arabic kitchen and is always a place wannabe. friendly service good attitude but i believe is rather expensive. but certainly i will go again,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Nice place, relaxed atmosphere, not a good value for money, large salad portions, not so impressive main dishes. Used to b more popular.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Though the staff was not the friendliest, maybe it was just us, the food was fresh, well prepared and the service was good. Not that easy to find a server when needed. But overall a good experience. We will be back",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"interesting oriental food, nice service, high rhythm music and out of the blue comes a belly dancer!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Great food,. Great service. Great wine. Great ambience. Small car park !! But you don't eat in the car park so go inside and treat yourself to some of Nicosia's best dishes at very reasonable prices",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I had dinner there several times. Nice, relaxing place to have dinner. Food is excellent and prices very reasonable. I would recommend it to every one.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Ok,but is very expensive for Cyprus if you take the family,on the other hand,they do bring a lot of food,the other downside is that they bring you too many plates of salad,I think about 4'they look and taste the same,if you can afford it then the price you pay is ok,quite big,nice decor,friendly service,good food,with a couple of drinks it will set you back about 30-35 euros per head,",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Do not expect great ambirnce and confort but you will get good clean food, good service at good prices! Desserts are a must too!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Good Syrian food (although have not tried other Syrian restaurants). Good selection of dip's, meats and salads. Reasonable prices and a rich menu to choose from. Great place if u like middle Eastern food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Food at the Syrian Arab Friendship club is almost always of good quality and very tasty. I am not impressed with the d√©cor but otherwise the food and service is fine!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I am not familiar with the Syrian cousine. Nevertheless it was a great surprise the wide variety of flavors and colors in it. I suggest go for a sample of thing, so you can try more rich plates.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Very tasty good quality food..freshly made bread in front of the customers is an attraction, belly dancer entertainment, staff very kind , good prices. Would recommend it! Escape from your routine ..",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,we usually go there with our family we usually orde meze its alot of food homs motabal mohamara baba ganoj tasty falafel and mix grill best hand made ice cream in nicosia from fresh milk friendly staff good service,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,The parking lot of the restaurant is very small and cannot accommodate the demand so have in mind you will need to waste some time fining one near the place. The restaurant is situated near the American embassy.The d√©cor is nice and reminds of Middle East. There are smoking and non-smoking areas. You can smoke Hookah is you want; we didn‚Äôt because me and my wife love our lungs.The dishes are excellent there are a variety of vegan and vegetarian dishes which is why we liked it. The prices were very good and the service was excellent and very polite. WE order fresh orange but we end up having mandarin juice instead.Anyway overall a friendly place for vegans and vegetarians.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"As already stated this is the Syrian Arab Friendship Club NOT the Piata Gourounaki! Having said that, the food is great! Things can be difficult for us as my husband loves meat and I am vegetarian but this place catered for both of us with ease. I ordered a selection of hot and cold appetizers. Portion sizes were big so I over ordered but between us we devoured the lot! Had such a good experience going back tonight!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We showed up on Friday night without a reservation, they kindly found us a table. We ordered the Vegetarian Meze for two, the servings were enough for 3 or 4. Two huge salads, hummus, a delicious mixture of red pepper, walnuts, and pomegranates, two tasty dishes featuring eggplant, falafal and a filo dough with cheese, served with a tahini sauce, Syrian mashed potato, accompanied by pita bread. The food is delicious and excellent value, though the drinks are slightly more expensive than at similar places. Friendly and efficient service.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"If you're looking for some great Middle Eastern food in Nicosia, this is the place for you. The vegetarian meze is excellent value at only ‚Ç¨9 per person and includes everything from tahini to tabbouleh and from fattoush to falafel. In fact, pretty much all your classic meat free meze dishes are included and all of them are prepared to a very high standard. But be warned, unless you've got a big appetite there really is no need to add in any extra dishes. We made the mistake of doing just that and ended up with way too much food. But nonetheless it was still great value at just ‚Ç¨39 for two including a bottle of mineral water & a couple of big bottles of local beer. Give them a try. You won't be disappointed.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,We were greeted by some not so welcoming staff. They were not helpful with the menu. We were a group of 4 and ordered some starters and for the main course we ordered each a mixed grill.The food arrived in one platter and when we counted the meat there was 6 skewers of minced lamb kofta and 6 small pieces of chicken and around 8 small pieces of lamb. They were all placed on a bed of pitta bread. The meat or the better the contents of the platter was certainly not enough for 4 people and the total cost of the food without the drinks was around 70 euros.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Very good food with excellent service. Going there frm last 12 yrs, once every two times. Service is excellent and staff also very friendly and well mannered. Very good to enjoy faimly time in summer evng.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Excellent food and service. Place is a little out of the way (15 minute walk from the centre), but worth the trip. Prices are good, too.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I have been visiting this place for many years. The quality and quantity of the food remains as good as in the beginning. They have made some nice renovations. Last time we went there we had a surprise since there was a belly dancer!!!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"We visit this restaurant quite often and the food never disappoints us. The quality of the the food is excellent, everything is fresh and well presented. A variety of choices both for vegetarians and meat lovers! The only ""bad"" thing i can say is that one time that we the waiter insisted on us having a dessert, he brought us dessert despite we told him we didn't want it, (of course we ate it) and they charged us the dessert. One would expect that they would have said it was on the house!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Visited a couple of days ago with two young children aged 3 and 4 and my husband. Had the meze 1 without the meat and added in 3/4 other vegi meze dishes that we fancied from the menu. The portions were excellent, food was gorgeous, delicious flavours and textures, service was fab, loved the roast aubergine dish, they provide bread gratis so bulked out the meal even more. Lovely fountain/pond on one side of the restaurant which entertained the kids and gorgeously fragrant lemon trees. Highly recommend this place.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This was our first time at a Syrian restaurant and despite the inexperience with the specialties our meal couldn't be better. The servers were very kind and attentive, the place took us to an Arabian scene. We recommend stopping by this place for a Syrian gourmet experience ;)",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Best Middle-East food in the island, nice place with excellent service, quiet place, tasty Syrian plates, salads, dips, oriental specialties.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The food was gorgeous. They do a vegetarian meze (which is actually the normal meze minus the meat, but ‚Ç¨6 cheaper) and of course if you've a particularly healthy appetite you can always add in a couple of other dishes like spinach pies and breaded cheese. We did this and there was still far more than we could eat.Other positives include a car park, fair value for money and very nice Syrian coffee (which we inadvertently ordered after asking for the bill, so they said the coffees, which should've been ‚Ç¨6, would be 'on the house' - you really can't complain about that!).The only downside (and the reason it gets 4 rather than 5 stars) is that, despite giving us free coffee and lovely food, the waiters (all male) were just a little bit stand-offish. I wouldn't go quite as far as saying they were unfriendly, but in comparison to the vast majority of restaurant staff in Cyprus, they were significantly less friendly. But it wouldn't stop me going back.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"If you like good arab cuisine, you will not be disappointed. Dont miss the mahalepi desert at the end. Excellent.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Nice outdoor sitting place, with middle eastern taste. Very good food, prepared personnel, good quality/price",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,Excellent food and rather reasonable prices. The grilled meats shish taouk (chicken) and kofta kebab (lamb) delicious and mouthwatering!!! The salads very tasty. Room for improvement in the service but overall not bad. Will visit again and again.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,Excellent choice close to capital's business centre. Fast and polite service and the food is well cooked & served in satisfactory amounts!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"First of all, I have been going to this restaurant for about 20 years, since it first opened, and I can say that they are consistently excellent. This is one of my favourite restaurants in Cyprus, and also one of my favourite restaurants in the world.If you love Middle Eastern food - you will be in for a treat!By the way, this place is not easy to find, as it is in a residential area, so look it up in advance.Booking - this place is popular and busy, so do book if you intend to visit.D√©cor - basically you are eating in a green courtyard garden surrounded by vines and various greenery - a good atmosphere indeed. You can also see the bread guy making fresh pitta breads.Food - ok, if you are new to this place, one idea is to go for the standard set mezze menu and you will be happy with what they bring. However, if you know your Middle Eastern food, then I would recommend ordering all the dishes individually. This has the added benefit that you will get exactly what you want. You see, when you order the set mezze, there will always be a couple of dishes that you did not really want or not quite like, but if you order on a dish by dish basis, you avoid that issue and secondly, depending on what and how much you order, the price per head will be more or less the same as the mezze set price. With 5 of us eating dinner, we basically ordered everything we wanted, various salads and vegetarian dishes (the works, muhamara, mutable, pickles, cheese puffs, falafel, hummous, fattoush - aaargh thinking about it is making me salivate!), and of course the grilled meats (chicken, lamb) etc - all excellent. Fresh bread comes as standard and they will bring you more if you ask.We also had some desserts, ice cream and baklava - but for me the main event is the mezze dishes.Service - good service overallPricing - in my view very reasonable and well worth the money.I look forward to a return trip.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,you eat arabic food in a meditterenean country nice place good for vegetterians because they serve a lot of salads falafel ecc but it is a little a bit expensive,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We had vege mezes. One of the best meal we had in Cyprus. Came with many dips, warm pita, falafel and fried cheese, and two kinds of salad, which were both excellent. Tabbpuli was exceptional. The best I've ever had and I'll be missing it forever. All for 9 euro per person. More food than we could finish.I would return to Cyprus just to go back there again!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This was fortunately one of the few places open on 1 January in Nicosia. For some reason this is not a place that we always think of when looking for somewhere to eat, but we are always happy when we come here! The ingredients are fresh, the pitta warm, the options many and the dessert is great.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Even if you are not aware of the Syrian food you can still order a mee according to the persons in your company and for sure you will wnjoy a tasty and quality/quantity food,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,We have never had a bad meal at the Syrian club. And their menu can easily be classified as healthy eating food. Check them out. You will love it!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Possibly the most authentic and the most amazing Arabic food you can have in Lefkosia. All dishes prepared fresh for you, but it's totally worth the wait! The tastes are just tantalizing - you keep wanting more. Plan on not having a huge meal before your visit here :)The ambiance leaves something to be desired, but that is more than compensated by the excellent service you get over and over again.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"i use to visit this restaurant for many years, the quality and service remained at high level, either in the garden or inside the enviroment is nice and plenty of parking place. Great variety of food , if you try meze or even with separate dishes.I like alot marinated chicken kebab, felafel, houmous always together with the fresh cooked pitta arab bread.Try it",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"I've been going to this place for the past 15 years or so. Quality has remained the same - impeccable. While you can dine here on the inexpensive side, it is on average a mid-range priced restaurant to fully enjoy yourself.The same people are there since the day I first dined at the restaurant. The dining experience was and still remains excellent as the flavors genuine and the food is properly prepared and served.There is a truly a huge variety of food that can easily cater to the needs of a die hard vegetarian through to a full fledged carnivore. I would know as I was a vegetarian for a few years and I frequented the place quite often.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"OUTSTANDING FOOD and HUGE PORTIONS for a very reasonable price !!!!!My partner and I ordered the Meze for 2 people and we were not disappointed in the least. There was barely enough room on the table for all the dishes we had...and we were sitting at a table for 4. We had 2 big salads, 4 or 5 bowls of homemade dips/spreads, a huge stack of warm pita bread, chicken, lamb, and several other items. All were great and we had so much food left over that we ate it all for breakfast the next morning !!!!!!!Prices were very reasonable and the service was excellent. Our waiter, from Syria, was very humble, soft-spoken and kind. I'm sorry I did not ask you your name, but you were wonderful.Eat at this establishment...you will LOVE it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Great -tasty dishes, nice choice for lunch or dinner,excellent service and atmosphere. Dont miss the homemade lemonade and the syrian coffee with kardanon",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,As a vegetarian it's so nice to go to a restaurant and find so many non-meat options that taste AMAZING!! visiting again this friday!!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,I have read many reviews and decided to give it a try.i ordered meze for 2 and the whole table was full woth salads and dips and when the meat came was just a piece of each.i have to admit that the tastes on the meat was very tasty and fresh,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The main asset of the restaurant is the ambience. Its wonderful garden is secluded and shaded by a colourful tent.The food is rather nice and tasty but I expected more. I wasn't overwhelmed but I wasn't disappointed either. We had a variety of meze including humus, babaganus, mutabal, and some other spreads that I am not aware of their names. One big bowl of fatus salad and another one with tabule. One plate with felafel and vegetable rolls as well as a plate with a variety of kebap.The beer washed everything down pleasantly and we finished with a mahlepi desert and a syrian coffee.Recommended!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"like the laid back set up, very friendly atmosphere, very good food, best prices good combination of great food and price",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Tourist season was nearly ower and the place was wery guiet on sunday evening. We had meze and on old man did not remember that only young ones can eat it all. But we did! Worth of every cent!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Frankly, even though this is one of the best restaurant I know in Cyprus, this level of service and fine cuisine may well compete with the best addresses of this kind Europe-wide. The grills and meats are great, the starters are mind-blowing. Nothing in the world would make me miss their delicious 'baba-ganoush'. The menu is vast enough to cater for any taste. The wines are delicious. The service is quite simply exceptional, and if you are lucky enough you might witness the evening belly-dancing accompaniment. The place used to be cheaper, but even today it is still a great value for money, expect to pay 17-20 EUR per person with drinks and deserts. Don't miss the lamb kebabs, the Syrian tabbouleh and aubergine-based dips. Kali oreksy!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
10,"This used to be one of my favourite eateries; but over the last 5 years years, the quality of food has declined enormously. The chicken particularly has a very bad after-taste and am prone to think that the quality of meat is sub-par or even past its use-by date. The decor it extremely out-dated and overall there is a sense that hygiene is not a top priority.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,Friendly with good range of Arabic food...including a shisha pipe after dessert! Sometimes there is a considerable delay between ordering food and its arrival. They do take aways but do not deliver,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I love this place... it is informal in a nice garden very enjoyable during summer and autumn. The food was great and so was the service. Some of us were vegetarians but this was no problem at all! food was fresh we had a huge variety of small plates... interesting food and flavours. Loved it will be back! easygoing casual place with great food at reasonable prices,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We had the meze and it was a delicious feast, especially enjoyed the Mouhamarra! The chaps serving were very friendly and it was well worth the walk from the old town",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The food tastes very nice and fresh (from the salads to the meat to the bread to the dips), the atmosphere is welcoming, the service very fast.You can find all sorts of traditional Syrian food. There is so much to choose from and it's the sort of restaurant that whatever is offered on the menu is delicious.Ideal for any sort of gathering, whether with friends, family or partner.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The restaurant had an outdoor courtyard, some might call kitsch but we love it. The food is consistently good each time we go in fact we order take away often too.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"My wife & I had the banquet for 2, it was simply amazing. The dips & meat meze were 10/10. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. The service was also amazing. Well done!!!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,its been around for over a decade and never lets down. but its a very simple place and presentation and taste varies from the chef they have at hand that day. sawa owned by the same chain is a much better choice and nicer atmosphere and more polite waiters.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I've been eating in this restaurant for the past 10 years and it's been a great experience every single time! The food is mouthwatering and the waiters are amazingly polite.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"On a day trip to Nicosia this caught our eye as the place we wanted to eat at (otherwise we'd have visited every night). The maze was amazing - some meals aware memorable holiday meals but for us this was one of the best meals of our lives!I had a selection of vegetarian meze dishes and my husband ordered a kebab - and then gobbled up my meze too!We'll be talking about our meal for years. If you like Middle Eastern, or just vegetarian food then go here.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,"Great service, very good food and nice atmosphere. The garden is lovely, but we would prefer more fans as it was hot outside. Meze costs 15euros which is reasonable, but ice cream costs 4euros p.p. People are more than happy to serve you and so friendly.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Great place to dine with friends relatives or even buy catering from !! Superb quality food if one admires Middle Eastern food while being in Cyprus. Great service and very helpful staff too. Will surely buy food from there again and again,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"Authentic syrian restaurant with exelant food and real syrian service with very friendly attitude.We try Falafel,humus,syrian salad,lamp means meat and bread and everythink was great.If you like this type of food you are in the right place.It's better to take a taxi to find the place if you are not familiar with the city.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,when i am entertaining friends this is always my go to restaurant. The food is authentic and the people there are so friendly and you feel like home... Usually I cant even get past the appetisers and that perfectly roasted pitta bread (fresh every day) but i always try to leave some room for dessert,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,No one has mentioned this restaurant to us since we arrived in Cyprus. This is a must visit for anyone! Nice gardens and very friendly staff. They know how to throw down a spread! All the food was great! Also there is hookah. This restaurant is now one of our regulars. Will definitely mention this restaurant to the expats in Nicosia.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

30,"The food is good and the selection is big. It's typical Syrian / Lebanese kind of food. I find it slightly overpriced especially if you don't get the set menu.For example if you order a main and a salad, the salad comes up to pretty much the same price as the main.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,I had very lovely dinner with my family their it was fantastic food with frindley staff great service lovely place,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Recommend for a relaxed informal business meal - 8 of us attended having typical Syrian food of average to good quality. Staff were friendly, surroundings are not special and would not take clients here who are looking for 4 to 5 star surroundings.Enjoyable night had by all although staff did looked to focus more time on the local regulars than our paying attention to our group.Would go again for the food as it is a change to other styles offered in Cyprus.Not a place that would impress, or support a business evening, more of a place to relax in your jeans...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I visit this restaurant regularly for many years now. It is serving consistenly high quality food with great service. It is really nice to enjoy dinner in the garden during the summer. I also consider the Syrian restaurant as value for money (it normally costs about Euro 12-15 per person). I highly recommend this restaurant, which is fit to all occassions.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The Syrian Arab friendship club at 17 Queen Amalia‚Äôs Street in Nicosia is a first class restaurant offering delicious Syrian dishes. The place is decorated in a nice, restraint Arabic way and is very clean. The atmosphere is very tranquil being conducive to a relaxing meal.We booked a table ‚Äì a wise move given the popularity of the Syrian Arab friendship club ‚Äì for four, two days in advance; the booking was a hassle-free process.We all ordered Mixed Grill (kebab, shish tawouk & shukaf) and Fattoush (traditional Syrian salad topped with crunchy pita bread and pomegranate dressing). Both dishes were first class: nicely cooked, very well presented and very tasty; what is more the quantity was enough to fill even the biggest stomach!Furthermore, service was excellent and the prices very affordable.We truly look forward to having dinner at the Syrian Arab friendship club again!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,Tried few Middle Eastern restaurants in Nicosia but I always return here. It's especially pleasant during the summer months when you sit outside. Friendly efficient service with very good prices. At about ‚Ç¨20 a person with wine one cannot complain. My advice is don't go with the fixed menu. Order individually.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,I have been there (with my wife) after the good reviews i have read here. We ordered the Meze for two.The food was very little based on the money we gave. We expect more dishes but the main dish (with the meat) was only one small dish for both of us.I thought that they did mistake and i have asked the waiter for this but he confirm me that all the meze was this plate.Moreover the service was not friendly.On the other side the food was tasty.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Been here many times and thoroughly enjoyed every meal. The mezze is delicious and offers a nice array of dishes in generous portions. The atmosphere is eclectic and fun and the staff is friendly. I recommend SAFC without hesitation.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Great food, great atmosphere, very reasonable prices for mezze (15 euro) and large portions! Service could be a bit better",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"If you like Syrian food, that's the place to go. The environment is nothing fancy but the food is good. they bake their own Syrian fresh flat bread, it comes hot and I recommend the mezze, it just covers all tastes.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

40,"perfect time to enjoy al-fresco dinner in the Syrian club rose garden. Spoiled for choices of food, suggest you finish yr meal with one of their mahalepi dessert and don't forget to ask for shisha (narghile) even if you are not a smoker : you can choose jasmine or apple flavour and accompany it by a dervish coffer for a perfect digestion..you are sure to return to this place where good food joins good service in a pleasant environment :)",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The food selection is great, all grills and breads and snacks are excellent. Loved everything we tried",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"This is a sure bet if you want beautiful Syrian / Lebanese food while also at a reasonable price. I've been here several times with my Cypriot family and we always have the meze. It's beautiful, varied and healthy food being perfect for both vegetarians as well as meat eaters. Every time I come to Cyprus to see family I will always pay a visit here or to the sister restaurant, Sawa, which is also in Nicosia.The service has always been swift, friendly and helpful and they make you feel very welcome. The standard of food is excellent and always fresh and vibrant.Go, you won't be disappointed.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,This a great restaurant - genuine Syrian food served by genuine Syrians in large and delicious portions. A regular haunt of Cypriots and Syrians alike.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"My first taste of Syrian food! Absolutely amazing! Great flavors, beautiful presentation and very good prices!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,The restaurant is just outside the centre of Nicosia/walled city. But the detour is well worth the effort. We enjoyed the most wonderful meze with both cold and hot dishes. We ordered meze for three between four people and it was more than sufficient. There were some different dishes which we had not experienced before. We sat outside in a covered terrace which added to the experience. The service was wonderful as we were never hassled and the waiter seemed to know when to come to the table. A wonderful way to finish off a day visiting all the sights of Nicosia.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Nice arab food plenty plates for vegeterians good prices. If you go on weekend make reservation to be sure.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"We were very happy to see that a Syrian Restaurant is at the top in Nicosia; the last time we visited this restaurant was almost 30 years ago, and we decided to visit it again to find out why it was ranked that high.The decoration has been upgraded to reflect a real oriental design.The reception was very warm with a big smile; the waiters kept spreading a nice ambiance all around, and the service was excellent.We didn't select the Mezze in order to enjoy our favorite dishes; the food quality was generally good; however the Houmous and Moutabbal needed more garlic and lemon; the Garlic Potatoes had almost no Garlic; the Olive salad was not that good, and the Hot Potatoes was mushy and not crispy as it should be. The Falafel were tasty, crispy and fresh, the chicken liver and the Grills were good, the Bread was superb; fresh directly from the oven, and the Syrian famous Ice Cream was delicious and out of this world.Prices are reasonable.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This place has been around for over a decade. It never lets you down. They always serve good quality Arabic food. Its sister restaurant, Sawa on weekends and dinnertime is a personal favourite choice. But during the weekdays this place is a safer bet as it never lets you down. Its a safe bet when you do not know where to go in Nicosia.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Been there many times. Service is excellent and food always of the highest standard. Staff are always friendly and efficient and know everything about the menu. Prices are also very good. Definitely value for money,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,The perfect place to eat Middle Eastern food and enjoy some good shisha. Order the meze and when you finish ask the waiter for their famous dessert; the mahalepi.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Gr8 food, gr8 prices & helpings, good service - all in all worth a repeated visit!Tender off-the-chargrill meats, and good-sized helpings make this place one to visit if you want some tasty Syrian/Lebanese food at a reasonable price. They also have a quaint and rustic marquee-type area in the restaurant with Arabic-style d√©cor - adds a nice and pleasant touch to your surroundings. Gr8 for taking family or a larger number of people to without hitting your wallet too much!Also has car parking.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Been there many times.Tasty ethnic food at reasonable prices. Friendly staff, good service and nice environment. The yard offers a good option for outdoor seating in the summer, although it becomes hot enough during some nights. Needs a bigger parking place.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Good quality and good service The last Syrian cusine in Cyprus You will enjoy the garden in the summer,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"First, thanks to Trip Advisor peeps for the tip. My husband and I were there with our 11 & 13 yr. old boys on a Wednesday night. We ordered the Meze for 4, as well as aubergine with yogurt and haloumi grilled in pita bread. Yes, we ordered way too much food. The salad, tabouli, every bowl of dip etc. we had was amazing. The falafel needs its own sentence. How do I explain to you how delightfully tasty, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside it was? I guess I just did it? I don't eat meat. Well, normally. But tonight I had to try a taste of all the meats my husband and kids were eating. The chicken, flavorful and tender melts in your mouth like butter. The lamb and beef were tender and extremely tasty. The pita bread fresh, fluffy and oven hot. Dessert was as you'd expect, great. Syrian ice cream, milk pudding (don't know the Arabic name) and baklava. All fabulous. And they were happly to box the leftovers for us. Wait staff were all great! Initially shy (or just reserved), but friendly and warmed up quickly. All-in-all great service and great food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I must admit that I never tried Syrian food and I was a bit cautious before I went to this restaurant for the first time, some years ago. Since then it became my best restaurant for ethnic food as it has excellent food, very tasty,good portions, very good service. I strongly recommend that you take it easy with the food and leave some space in your stomach for the syrian sweets.It is good to go along with friends or family especially if you have children that do like to taste different type of food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,the restaurant offers tasty syrian food at good prices friendly staff they also offer meze set menu at a fixed price depending on the number of people. i prefer the individual plates though in order to choose what i like the most.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The quality of food and service are excellent. I've been visiting this restaurant for ages and the quality of food is always excellent. The staff is friendly and polite. I personally recommend fattoush, chicken kebab, falafel, mouhamarra. Most of the dishes are very good.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Tais restaurant is one of the n'est I Know. The quality of the food is incredible and the prince is low. For 20‚Ç¨ you get an extraordinary s√©lection of Syrian cold dishes ( taboul√©s, hoummos, salads....) Then the grilled meat comestible,plenty of it: chicken, lamb,beef, sausages, silices of pizza. and you can askfor the leftovers; they Will provide a sp√©cial bag. The service is very good and efficient",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I have been eating at this restaurant and it's sister establishment in Limassol for many years and have never been disappointed. The dips are delicious and the shish tauk - marinated grilled chicken pieces are my favorites..ans felafel...the service is always good as is the ambiance - especially in the summer when dining is in the garden and in the tent area where you can relax on cushions ( I think that;s still there...I HOPE it is!) And the prices are very reasonable as well.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Really nice food, good quality. Service was good, polite and pleasant staff. Loved the meze with all Syrian traditional dips.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The Syrian Arab Friendship Club has been a staple in the Nicosia restaurant circuit for years. What is remarkable (I would say almost unique in Nicosia) is that in all these years it has not dropped its standards in food quality or service.If you want a good-to-excellent Eastern Mediterranean meze venue then look no further. Excellent, freshly prepared home made dips, constant supply of fluffed out fresh off the grill flat bread, crisp salads and an impressive array of really flavoursome cooked mezze dishes.The meat selection that comes at the end may be a disappointment to Greek/Cypriot visitors as it may be considered under par compared to the quantity of meat served at similar Greek taverna venues. For more 'European' taste buds like mine it is cooked/grilled beyond recognition too.The complimentary desert and the offer of a nargile (hubbly bubbly) round up the best value for money meal in Nicosia.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,The best Syrian food in Nicosia! Prices are very decent and the food is delicious. The staff as well are friendly and the service is good. Happy to go back any time.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This use to be a frequent restaurant we would visit when we lived over there. It's where we would go for every special occasion and take visitors when they came to stay. We loved the atmosphere the food and the service. We loved it so much when we moved back to the UK my husband insisted I learnt how to cook some of the dishes. We love our little Syrian nights and reminisce over how wonderful a time we had there. We loved all the meze dishes but my favourite were the breaded mushrooms, the cheese filo parcels, and the lamb kebabs. Everyone who we took there loved this place and we regularly took our baby with us. She now loves it when I cook Syrian meze. Wish we could go back there. If we ever return to the island this is definitely the first place of will be visiting.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This is one of the best hidden secrets of Nicosia. Tucked away in a residential area, you will never bump into it. First impressions are mediocre at best. Decor is tacky and the place definitely needs renovation. But the service is excellent and the food is great. Try: felafel, shish taouk, wonderfully fresh salads ( tabouli), all the dips as well as the lamb. Everything is accompanied with freshly baked Arabic pitta. A real treat. As for the prices. One of the cheapest places around. You could eat with 15 euros per person. You could eat like a king for 20. Definitely recommended!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,A meal for the whole family( 6 people) before the university students went back to their respective countries,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,In this restaurant I admired the Syrian cuisine. Everything was delicious! We liked the kabab the most. The staff was very kind. I have never met such good manners on a restaurant before. I assure you it worth a visit.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Staff friendly and very helpful the food is wonderful only order meze if u really hungry. This is a must in Nicosia,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,We visited the restaurant last night with family and we were amazed by the quality of the food as well as the quantity! The prize was fairly okay and deserved every cent spent. I definately recommend it to others and is indeed one of the best restaurants in Nicosia district.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I recently visited Syrian Friendship Club, during my third trip to Cyprus. I am a vegetarian and I enjoyed the variety, the freshness of the food and the atmosphere. I would highly recommend eating here!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We live in North Cyprus and decided to give this restaurant a try after seeing the good reviews about it. Although we walked more than half an hour after crossing the UN border, the food eased our pain :) the variety of mezzes and the taste of grills is just heaven. Definitely a go-go if you are into Syrian food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This restaurant has offers Great food quality and very delicious meals. Staff very friendly. Prices were ok. I was very exited, I will definitely go again",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"It serves Syrian cuisine and authentic enough. It has a very nice garden and one or two nomad type rooms taht when you smoke nargillah all you are missing is the AK 47 by your side and the drones flying on top of your head.Thank God you are in Cyprus. The restaurant has been on forever and I must have visited it 5-6 times both day n night.Usually food at night is better. When I visited teh place for Sunday lunch in October we felt taht some of the food especially the dips had formed a thin crust on top-Typically they must have been prepared on Saturday night. Similarly the falaffels were not crisp on the outside and felt taht they had either been warmed up in an oven..There was no soft pitta made on the day but only the normal basket with pitta there. Otherise teh staff as usual were smiling and looked happy (I would b too if was a Syrian working at a restaurant in Europe right now)Ultimately we prefer the Sawa off Pindarou street. The ownership and service is the same (as expected!) and the food I find that is more carefully prepared and presented.Overall, if you are reading this and you feel bohemian, college student or like a more free spirited place then do go to Syrian Arab.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Really typical restaurant in which I had the possibility to taste the main Syrian dishes. Food was really good and the atmosphere of this huge restaurant is unique!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Very nice syrian food in good prices! We tried the meze, for 15 euros per person, which was nice and had many dips...! Interior design could be improved... although the garden looks nice for the summer!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The Syrian Arab Friendship Club has preserved, through the years, the food quality to its highest standards. The interior of the restaurant has its own laid back character, and together with the smell of shisa, is giving you a feeling that you are abroad. Try out the Syrian coffee at the end of your meal and the home made ice-cream.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The Syrian Friendship is one of the best eating places in Nicosia, which we rate the highest of all the Syrian Friendship restaurants. It's decor is daft, barmy and beguiling, the service superb, the food consistently of such good quality, fresh, wonderful flavours,a truly delicious experience.In all the years we have been going it has never failed to please.I highly recommend if you have never been do treat yourselves it will surely become a firm favourite as it has with us and almost everyone we know.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,We had falafel and mixed grill. The falafel was very average and I had homemade much better. The mixed grill was not really for 2 people. More like for 1&¬º Nice meat and ok cooked (grilled) but no great standards. Very good service thought.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"One of my favourite places! The atmosphere gives you the impression you are in a different country, from the decoration to the food itself. I would suggest to choose a standard variety. It is accompanied with many salads and Syrian delicacies like Muhammara, Fatoush and others. The pitta bread comes just from the oven hot.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Delicious Syrian food and very good staff. The place is nice, as well as the atmosphere. We had a very good time!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Absolutely loved the food here. After looking for some arab places to eat in Cyprus we found this and were not disappointed. The service was fast and above all the food was amazing. We ordered Falafels and Fatayers for starters and they were very very nice. Will definitely go again.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I visit the restaurant 2-3 times a year and it never disappointed me. Usually I go there for dinner but this time we went there for Saturday lunch. The food and service were excellent as always, but the place was deserted.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Great food and great service within a relaxed environment. The quality of the food is excellent and so is the service.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"for around 30 euro, we ordered the mix kofta grill, Hommos, Kebba, taboula salat and coca cola and it was yummmmmmy. the waiter is so nice. DON'T MISS IT",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"THE GOOD:Food is tastyService is goodDecor is niceParking availableTHE NOT SO GOOD:wifi signal could be better, although you don't go to a restaurant for it's wifi.We ate here for lunch, we were the first ones here, the place is not very busy on a Saturday lunch. The food was good and so was the service, it has an interesting decor.We shared a lot of the food as you would at these sort of places and it was very tasty and good.It is great that there is free parking as well which is a huge bonus.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"We have been at Syrian Arab Friendship Club in June with some friends, after being there more than two years ago. We were five persons and we ordered the meze platter that is a variety of abab salads and three kinds of kebab with pitta-bread, a beer and a bottle of water and dessert only for the three of us (mahalepi) and paid 100 euro .Food was more than enough, too much salads, but i think is overpriced, the service not quick, we had to wait a lot as the restaurant was crowded,the atmosphere was very noisy and the place needs renovation. For people who love Syrian food will be perfect, but I'm not sure if i want to go again... maybe i will give another chance...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Highly recommended. Great food, good prices, nice ambiance! It does give the feeling of ""friendship""",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This relaxed Syrian restaurant is the best value for money restaurant in the city. The dips are not to be missed, as are the several varieties of kebabs. Wash the delicious food down with some Arak and if you have some room try the nargile (shisha). This place always gives me a nostalgic effect, with it's relaxed atmosphere, good service and consistently excellent food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This restaurant offers great variety of Syrian food, many options in meat plates and of course big variety in different dips for the Syrian food lovers. A place not to be missed. Special service and nice atmosphere.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"This place is sooo much Syrian, ist just not possible you are in Nicosia!So go and take Advantage of it, as ist Food is splendidRecommed the Mezze Platter which in itself for a Group of 3 or 4 or more is so much Food, you will p√ºrobably stop ordering,We specially liked the grilled mixed meat.go!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Nice place in Nicosia tasty grilled food and meza .Beautiful garden .I like the salads and the grilled minced meat (kofta) and kebab,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,This restaurant produces terrific Lebanese/Middle East style food and at last Nicosia has a worthy successor to Abu Faisal. We chase one of the set mezes with a few additions and we were not disappointed. Lovely fresh salads and dips and really tender meat.Although a large restaurant the service was quick and friendly and well deserves the excellent reviews it is getting.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Excellent quality of food! Try the meze that has almost evrything in.Very good service- fast and polite.the decor is not that great,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Although in the suburbs, it is an excellent place to visit.Wonderful environment , lots of trees and plants if you prefer to sit outside.The waiters are very friendly,helpful and give their suggestions for the kind of food they serve. The food is just delicious.Many choices of salads but especially the "" taboule"" for those who like parsley is top. The desert is very tasty too. Differrent menu from usual food but superb! I would definitely recommend it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,There is no question what to order it must be the meze. We only ate 80 % of the meal as we were stuffed but it was by far our Favorite meal in Cyprus.No problem getting a table mid week but book if you try on a weekend. Very fast service and helpful staff.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Another great find in Nicosia. In a side street but when you arrive it could be in a garden. Lots of trees and shrubs the table outside were set out around the plants wonderful atmosphere. The waiters were very helpful and attentive and the food was just superb. An excellent menu so much to choose from or else you can try a set menu, which we did on this occasion it was very tasty and most enjoyable.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Great price lovely food and venue.. staff were really friendly and helpful.. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I love this restaurant and will always try and visit it when I am in Nicosia. The food is outstanding Middle Eastern meze type dishes which are perfect for vegetarians as there is so much choice. For meat eaters the mixed meat platter is a delight of exquisitely spiced (but not too spicy) delicousness!Usually we end the meal with a lovely set milk dessert called Malabi with a good sprinkle or rose water. If you like white wine, then give the Thisbe a go. It's very drinkable if you like a medium-dry wine.Much of the restaurant seating is set in the open under colourful canopies. The restaurant is relaxed and friendly and, on the Friday night we went, the restaurant was very busy with a lively, laid back and welcoming atmosphere. We had an 'early' dinner and book the table for 8pm! The service is efficient and friendly.I've always had a great meal here or at their sister restaurant, Sawa, also in Nicosia. I will certainly go again.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Lovely people, lovely food, lovely atmosphere! A beautiful restaurant in the middle of town. Cannot fault the service, the food or the atmosphere. Do try it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Atmosphere is great : definitely a fun place to have a meal with friends ..lots of varieties forvegetarians and meat eaters and there's a very unique food types which I've never taste like it before very tasty so delicious simply the best placeone of the best places for shisha as wellRecommended highly,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,The restaurant sits in a nice garden. Service is attentive by mostly arab guys. They really try their best. Food is the traditional M.E. fare. Mezze was fine and come quickly. I really had a great evening with goid old friends and that is exactly what we wanted.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I am feeling very pleased with myself for doing my homework and adding this restaurant to our list of places to visit during a recent trip to Cyprus. We combined our visit with a day trip to Nicosia, and arrived here for lunch. It is quite a big restaurant, but we were the only visitors at that time. By the number of place settings I imagine it gets quite busy in the evenings. The service was very welcoming and friendly, and with 3 vegetarians in our group it was very easy to choose what to eat. Basically we all shared a wonderful vegetarian mezze, and enjoyed the unusual (for us) dishes. A memorable meal for sure!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"My mother in law decided to have a surprise birthday party for my father in law.  It was the first time my wife and I had gone to the Syrian Friendship Club although my mother in law had always praised it.  When we arrived I was surprised that there was ample parking in their own private parking place plus the surrounding roads, a must for Nicosia.  Upon entry, the staff were very helpful, polite and seemed to have everything under control.  We were around 30 people and without any fuss we were shown to our table and our every wish was taken care of.  Dish after dish of delicious Syrian food kept arriving, was totally surprised at the variety.  The restaurant had even arranged a birthday cake for my father in law and it was brought to him with accompanying versions Arabic and English music singing ‚Äòhappy birthday to you‚Äô.  I cannot fault the service, very professional.  My mother in law made a wonderful discovery in this restaurant and we will certainly visit them again soon.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We had a simply fabulous experience at this restaurant. Arrived early, but still welcome and presented with fabulous feast. Mezze, salads and meat dishes, colourful, plentiful, tasty and healthy. By the time we left the restaurant was nearly full, attesting to it's well deserved popularity. The food was amazing, and a tiny taster plate of baklava when we mentioned being too full for a sweet course but still wishing to try one, was thoughtful. 2 out of the 3 of us had our first taste of a 'hookah', very unexpected fun. So much so that the teen purchased one from the venue producing only quibble, cannot get it to work. Would definitely recommend venue and will try to return.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The shortage of good Lebanese restaurants in Larnaca (both Habibi and Abu Dany have closed recently) was the reason for us to travel to Nicosia's suburb and search for this restaurant. Couple of years ago we tried its branch in Limassol and had a very good experience. They serve tasty meze and they have honest prices. The service is good, the meze for two is abundant. The atmosphere inside is nice, the location is a bit less. The restaurant is located in one of the small streets outside of the centre, it's not that easy to find, there is no sign to lead to it, nothing to be seen around. But the food experience is worth the time spent while looking for the place. My only disappointment is that they have limited choice of puddings, i.e only muhallabia and baklava, but after all it's hardly needed after such a meal. I highly recommend it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Totally superb. So nice to eat out and get something better cooked than I can do at home I never knew tabbouleh was really supposed to have so mych parsley although I'd read it in cookery books. Falafel immensely good. Crisp on the outside biting to a tasty inside. Salad with th thew crunchy bits of pide wonderful. I couldn't stop eating it. Hone made pide too. All the better for picking up food. We ate everything. My guest had lamb chops well done. A real haven for vegetarians in Cyprus who are fed up of people asking them if they want halloumi helim. We also has Syrian coffee which is quite different to Cyprus coffee. We also had ice cream which was a bit like Turkish marash ice cream (sticky gum). And baklava which came as a mixed plate of sweets but was so sweet. They brought extra bowls and spoons with the desserts which was a nice thought because wanted to share anyway. Service great. Friendly and casual. Lots of polite goodbyes as we left. I will definitely go again. Great place to take visitors. Wonderful. Go and you will not regret it.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Always nice to eat at this restaurant. The staff is always friendly and happy to serve customers. The food is delicious and fresh. Love the Fatous Salad and the aubergine dip! Would definitely eat there again!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"My husband and I were in June 2014 in this restaurant invited by my husband's cousin. It was 4 of us and since we (my hubby and I) never tasted Syrian food, his cousin ordered every single thing from the mezze menu. In one moment, out table was full of small plates with different food.. I've tried everything, and was delighted. Fresh, tasty and not spicy at all. Since that I cannot eat meat, this type of food (different salads, mush potato with lemon and garlic, and lot of fresh spices) was the BINGO. Falafel and babaganoush is my favorite :) and their pita-bread..mmm... hot, fresh.. We were not so lucky to see a belly dancers, but never mind.. maybe some other time.Waiters are so kind, nice, polite, and very friendly. Always around when you need them..Would love to can come back but for sure will recommended for sure. As per my opinion, A MUST when you are in Nycosia.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Really fresh dips and salads and nice meat, spicy but not hot. Good place for a quiet business dinner, except for the belly dancing nights Thursday- Saturday.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I went there with my friends we where 8 people we orded full meze the food was good and taste we orded ice cream the best ice cream i tried its hand made ice cream very taste friendly service taste food specialy the mohamara that is made of red peper and waulnuts this is the best syrian food in nicosia,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Seven of us had the Mezze, with drinks and dessert. Price was around 20 euro per person. The food was fresh and delicious. Highly recommended.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Staying in Nicosia we were told to try this place - particularly as my wife is vegetarian and Cyprus is a meat eaters paradise and, though the salads are often excellent we wanted a bit more choice. It took a bit of finding in the dark, near the Lebanese embassy, but when there we were in semi open tented style awnings with traditional Arabic decor. Service was formal and attentive and the menu was very easy for the uninitiated as it contained pictures!The array of food set before us was indeed a feast. we had a wonderful mix of cold and cooked vegetable dishes and chicken and lamb. The Tabbouleh was a tasty treat alone!The roast Aubergine and diced potatoes...well in fact everything (almost) was perfect. The boy had ordered minced meat parcels...these did not arrive..we reminded them and they did arrive..looking a bit like a root vegetable in breadcrumb. These were universally disliked.But the point of trying is that you are going to come across the occasional thing you do not like.Again we had wine beer and pop..this was a relaxed restaurant setting quite large but characterful. In my view well worth seeking out.The total cost was 63 Euro`s. We were very happy.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I have been to there many times with friends and family its a perfect Place they have many dips also a great selection of meats nice atmosphere very good prices and friendly Service,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The place is great, the atmosphere is nice and quite, staff are always polite and helpful, and food is great.I have been there several times, and anytime someone would visit from abroad I would take them there for a real taste of the Arabic food and hospitality.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,One of the best restaurants in nicosia i went there i orded full meze it was alot if food very good prices they have good friendly service best food and best friendly service one of the best,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Syrian Arab friendship club is always our first choice when we want something relaxing and calm, either when with girls company or even in couples. Is so friendly and certainly has very tasteful and refreshing meals. The keyword to this restaurant is ""balance"" of taste, of clients and of prices.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I have been coming to this place for many years now and things have only gotten better.The atmosphere of the place is great and they make you feel very welcome. The food is excellent - whether you order the ""meze"" or other dishes off the menu.Well worth a visit if you like Arabic food.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,This is the second time I have visited this restaurant. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. Fun place to visit!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Family visit for lunch. Great ambiance and the food good, as always. Excellent service and can be used totally if you are vegetarian. Seems like always we go for the meze in order to try a variety of dishes and enjoy it.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Lovely flatbreads cooked in front of you to dip into various mezes. Particularly love the pomegranate dip. Pretty courtyard with fountain, little oasis in the city.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"If you love arab cuisine then you will become a huge fan of Syrian Friendship Club. You cannot go wrong with this place whether you are go for a date, a business lunch/dinner or just want to have a great restaurant to catch up with friends. Menu is great, service is friendly and the most important thing of all - the food! Fantastic! So make sure to book your table, order the pre-dinner sheesha (hookah), cold beer and enjoy a great evening.PS: The mezze is a great way to introduce you to the menu!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,First time i went to syrian club already catch my attention with the quality of the meals and the service. Great athmosphere and very friendly staff. The best place to try famous syrian cuisine and to spend a nice time with friends and family. Now i am just like most of my friends a regullar customer weekly. I highly recomend it to visit for everybody.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,We went there we orded meze it was alot of dips 2salads and taste mix grill friendly service nice place also we tried the syrian ice cream that is hand made very tasty one of the best rrsturants in nicosia,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"We went there as a family group to celebrate my daughter's birthday; it was my first visit there although everyone else had been before and were always singing its praises. The environment was really exotic - in the centre was an old water wheel with water trickling through and lots of ancient artefacts decorating the central yard. The service was quick and efficient and there was a huge selection of exotic and delicious dishes to order from; what I particularly liked was the fact that there was something for everyone - meat eaters and vegetarians alike. The food was beautifully cooked and we were impressed that the wine and other drinks were quite reaonably priced. The only disadvantage was that the place was extremely crowded but this was probably because it was Sunday lunchtime, so in future we'll keep our visits to weekdays. One big advantage is that the Club also provides takeaway so it's also handy for someone wanting to entertain people at home.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"This place was great once upon a time, but over the ten years every year I give it a shot and every year it disappoints. However, it still is the best value for money place in town. Better try Sawa on Klimentos street, same owner higher service and better chefs.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"A relaxed restaurant a little out of town we had the Mezze it cost 15 euro per head, there was 12 of us in our party there was not enough room on the table for all the food that never seemed to stop coming, I will be surprised if we managed to eat half of it. very good selection to suit all tastes",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"The food and service are just great, I could say that the meat is not that much, but the salads and starters are so many that there is no place left for the meat at the end",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"the place is actually quite terribly decorated but it has been around for ever!! the food is constantly steadily great! Lebanese, Syrian maze to make you dribble!! the outdoor seating is a must for the hot summer nights and trust me I don't see how you can not enjoy it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"A very nice and relaxing place with very nice food. The service was friendly and fast, and the prices was low for the quality of the food. Very nice choice for a Syrian food!!!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,This is one of my most favourite places as i love Syrian food! I always call ahead and order over the phone so as soon as we arrive we are served immediately which is great for a business lunch. The meze is always up to its high standard every time and everything is always fresh. The service is quick and the atmosphere is relaxing. There is a beautiful garden area in the middle and i imagine would be very romantic at night.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Everytime we go we get the meze and we are all times happy! A great variety of dips and salads, and at the end a large plate full of meats. So, if you go forget about your diet if you want to enjoy it!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,Love this place.!!!!! very good food and when you go dont forget to order mastiha ice cream and of course nargile!!!!!!!!!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"All time classic choice when you are hungry, you can't be bothered to dress up and you want to enjoy a nice meal!We have visited the restaurant on many occasions and on different times of the year and the service and quality is always of high standards!Keep up the good work!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club

50,"dont belive what ever u hear we orded meze it was more then enougth ,very friendly stuff which i didnt see in other restaurants .good service i think this is one of the best restaurants in nicosia u have to try it the most i liked its the falafel and shish tawok..dont forget to make resevation to have a table in the garden full of green around you",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
20,"I'm really surprised with some of the reviews of this restaurant. The restaurant (as a place) is ok, but food quality is really bad!! Service is good and environment is very friendly.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,I went with my family on Sunday to try syrian meze and desserts. I got excited with the big variety of cold and hot appetizers. i really liked syrian mahalepi with pistachios. The environment was pleasant and staff was very helpful and with a smile on face. You have to go there if you want to eat authentic syrian cuisine as the chefs are syrian!!!!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Quick service, the food came 10 minutes after we ordered! Good atmosphere and personel was friendly! I...This is one of the places where you get genuine syrian food made by syrians! Its amazing. Good quantities and value for money.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Very nice place, food is great and it comes in a quantity that you cannot finish it. The waiters where hyperdriendly and this declination of Syrian meze is indeed pleasant. Don't believe silly people who write that food is not good or not enough. You'll burst with flavour, see my picture.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
10,"I have been visiting this place for years and it was a good place with good Syrian food, good service and reasonable prices. During our last visit with friends, we ordered specific dishes and we observed that we were receiving what we had ordered plus some more. We called our waiter twice explaining to him the situation and his reply was ""it's on the house"" twice. The third time that something came to our table without being ordered we called the manager trying to clear up the situation. We received the same reply. At the end though we were charged with everything (ordered and not ordered) plus three sodas which we did not order, were not delivered to our table and of course not consumed. When we called the manager again he was at least rude and he was very insulting.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I have visited this restaurant on more occasions that I can remember really. Food is of constantly good quality. The staff always friendly. I recommend this place especially during the non-winter months as the heating arrangements during the winter are poor. Overall, one of the very good places to eat in Nicosia.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Yes, this is my favourite place to eat of all the places I have travelled too so far - and that is quite a few. This may in part be down to fantastic memories of days gone by in Nicosia and that we had gotten to know the restaurant quite well - but it has got a lot to do with the the amazing food too.I still long to return for the tabbouleh salad, muhammara (red pepper and walnut) dip, flat breads (they do these in impressive size and quantity), falafels, halloumi pieces and the lamb kebab.They also do takeaway of all of their menu (I wonder if they deliver to the UK!). I would go back to Cyprus just to eat here!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,An excellent meze and very many choices for the food and the wines. Our favourite place to dine out.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Very good value for money. Syrian cuisine is delicious anyways (perfect for vegetarians; a great variety of fresh salads and veggie dishes), the venue is nice and simple and waiters always helpful.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I have been having dinner at the Syrian Friendship Club few times and the quality of the meze is consistently very good. Extra points for the excellent service as it is very attentive and fast - you will not have to wait around. I am finding it hard to describe the interiors, fine dining it is not for sure and I actually think (not sure though) that the part of the restaurant you can smoke is a tent. But it is definitely an original experience and as said, the food it wonderful. Excellent value for the money. Recommend taking a taxi to go to the restaurant however as it is outside the town centre - all the taxi drivers know how to find it.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,This is one of the places where you get genuine syrian food made by syrians! Its amazing. Good quantities and value for money. We had the meze and a shisha after and the whole experience was worth it.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"go several times, its worth it, the food is good, and you¬¥ll not worry any longer about the ""aladin and the 40 thieves"" style menu card. the food is great, the location ok, the style far from satisfying - but the food rules the place. great dips, aubergine, peppers with walnut, great grilled meats, tasty salads, i recommend.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Great restaurant! We ordered meze and it was delicious. Although it has mostly dips and the mixed grill should be a little larger. I dont say it's not enough but i think for it's price need to be larger. But it was fantastic. Quick service, the food came 10 minutes after we ordered! Good atmosphere and personel was friendly! I highly recommend mahalepi!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"This is one of a group of three restaurants under the same management in Cyprus. I've been multiple times there and always have been satisfied with the food. This is maybe the best of the three in terms of food (we tried the other two as well which are also good). Go for the meze as you get a broader idea of the Syrian cuisine and it's not less than a feast of Middle Eastern traditional flavours. During summer time is a must that you sit outside in the garden! The last time we've been there I was not super satisfied with the service as there was a big delay for a waiter to come and get our order. Any thought we had of maybe seeing the menu for choosing something else than the usual meze went away as we didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for the waiter to get us the menus and additional time in ordering. We asked right away for meze. Then it took us a bit to call the waiter for the bill. Personnel though is always kind and friendly. Maybe this delay we experienced the last time was due to the fact that restaurant was full. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Tip: Finish your dinner with the mastic ice cream which is AMAZING by all means! So pure taste, an absolute must!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Mezze seems to go on for ever and includes many delicious items. Staff are attentive and the location, enabling outdoor eating, is evocative of balmy evenings in the Levant.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,I visited that place with friends and family many times. Very good food and friendly staff.Normal price. They also serve the traditional nargile!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I had read a review about this restaurant, ""not to miss if in Nicosia"". And they were right, it was excellent. The menu is extensive, and unless you are familar with the cuisine some help from the waiter might be required. Very helpful waiters they were. Marvellous bread baked on the premises. And a good selection of Middle Eastern wines. We had an excellent white wine from the Lebanon.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Great value for money as this place serves simple, yet excellent in food in quality and taste at a low cost.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"The Syrian Friendship Club Restaurant in Nicosia is a place I visit often.The food quality is great, with excellent dips and succulent grilled meats. This is also one of the few restaurants in Cyprus with satisfactory vegetarian options. The food variety is not enormous but each dish is very good. The service is swift and courteous with enough waiters to avoid unnecessary waiting time. The meze is rich but is composed mostly of dips with some grilled meats in the end.There is a large garden which is great in the summer when it's not too humid and nargileh is also offered to conclude a satisfying dinner.Ultra-tacky arabesque decor aside, this is a true gem of a restaurant offering great value. For four adults I paid a total of 90 euros which included a bottle of wine, dessert, enough food to get stuffed and a nargileh in the end. I am looking forward to the next time I visit.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,The setting is beautiful. The food is excellent.. The staff are very helpful. One of the best restaurants in the area. Everyone we have taken there have been impressed.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Excellent salads and starters followed by delicious kebabs. Fresh bread is good too. Choose a red wine which will be chilled. Try to sit outside in the summer.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I always go here when I am in Nicosia. The menu is huuuge and varied, exceptional for vegetarians given the mezze range and excellent felafel.The service is good without being brilliant but this is fine as you go for the food. It suffers from the Cypriot obsession with smoking where/whenever possible, which is a shame as it does detract from the nice garden environment and make a mockery of the ""ban"" on smoking.Never been disappointed in over 10 visits...",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"In the embassy district, with a large outdoor garden. Parking can be hard to find but worth the walk. Phone ahead.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Very Good VFM - great if you like the narghile as well. Service always quick and attentive,",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Nice garden to sit in during the summer and you can enjoy a nice meze with all the main traditional dishes. Lot of dips and salads are included.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"Very friendly staff, cozy environment, very good quality food, excellent value for money. Ample space for accommodating a big crowd.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,one of the least restaurants that serves pork free dishes. I love their tasty traditional Syrian recipes. The environment is very oriental and cozy . don't forget to order the nargile-smoke after the dessert!,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"Nice place to go with friends, food was ok, a bit flat tasted though..",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,A great recommendation by both Lonely Planet and Rough Guide. This is not the easiest restaurant to find - but worth traversing the streets of Nicossia as the food was brilliant. There is plenty of parking when you get there. I would recommend the set menu as this gives a great range of cuisine and chance to sample the range of mezze. Excellent for vegetarians,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
30,"not a place to go on a date..decor is not nice,very plain.we were 8 ppl and ordered the pre set meze menue.... no1 came to explain what each dish was...and it was our first time we were gonna try this kind of kitchen...food came really fast... but they were too many dips and not ""real"" food....",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"Lovely food, although rather a lot! Good, friendly service. Great value for money. We go there frequently when we go to concerts in Nicosia and have never had a bad experience.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,The choices of food in the mezze are exceptional. The salads alone are worth the visit. Come with an appetite or do not go at all.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"I had the pleasure of visiting several times earlier in 2011. It has a very good selection of messes, kebabs etc., very typical middle easter fare.The food was fresh and tasty, with very ample servings. The Syrian ice-cream was a plleasant surprise.The staff were friendly and attentive, without being annoying.Smokers have a completely separate eating area.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
10,I was shocked how dirty this place isthere was a hair in the saladthey literally cheated their way with the bill . we ordered 6 portions but were charged 9.awful service - we felt pressured as if they were trying to kick us out.just follow my advice - DON'T go there,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"It's hard to find but worth it. The food and service was excellent, it's probably as authentic as you will find outside Syria and represents good value for money. Plenty of options for vegetarians including an amazing dish of wafer thin pitta bread stuffed with halloumi. Yum.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,Tasty food. Good price.,Syrian Arab Friendship Club
10,"The meze menu includes some dips and salads that look like they were bought from the supermarket. This is 95% of the whole meze menu with a few kebabs brought afterwards.A couple of beers, one desert and a shared nargile afterwards the bill came at 35 euro per person!!!For 35 euro in Nicosia you can eat at best restaurants and tavernas!",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"One of our favoutirte restaurants in Nicosia, expect the best Syrian food, served by waiters who are discreet but there. Food is very fresh so takes a bit of time to arrive but that's Cyprus and if you don't learn to chill out, you won't survive a trip to the island. Menu is based on meze dishes and the 1-6 person meze is very good value. The Lebanese red wine is also extremely palatable and cheap for a good wine. We go there every 2 months or so and always take friends there when they visit. Good atmosphere but expect very different decor! Best to book as usually busy.",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
40,"its nice,clean,friendly.Not much variety.SImple but good",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
50,"I have visited Damascus, and tasted Syrian food. Syrian Friendship Club brings exactly that in Cyprus.The menu is a list of ""meze""-dishes, you can choose as many as you like, and they come in the form of dips. And finger food. At least I would calle it finger food. But it's defenetly fullfilling.The place is friendly, and so are the people who work there.Don't forget the desert.. Ask for the traditional mahalepi..",Syrian Arab Friendship Club
