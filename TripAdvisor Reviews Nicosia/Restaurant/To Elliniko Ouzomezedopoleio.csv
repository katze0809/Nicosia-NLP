20,Big portions.nothing to do with meze.dishes should be smaller so that customers can taste more.the orzo tasted only ouzo seafood was completely uncooked.sardines overcooked and tasteless.salad and tarama were good.this is not the mezedopolio concept as in greece.sorry .,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Staff was really friendly and helpful.. I went with friends and we had some great dishes to share.. e.g. zucchini balls, aubergine with tahini was exceptional!! Cold beers and cheers to that place!!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Located within the Hilton park hotel Nicosia. The food was well presented and tasty mainly the chicken with bulgur. The desert was just ok(ekmek kadyifi). The service was average, should be much better!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"The restaurant was located in our hotel and I was pleasantly surprised to see locals also eating here. The dishes were all served very quickly, and all tasted super fresh. The eggplant dishes were quirky and well presented.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"I went with a friend for lunch and for dinner. Ouzomezedopouleio means a place serving ouzo and mezedes (a series of portions of a variety of foods such as cold meats, kebabs, salads etc) but in fact they serve a la carte meals too. Here you will find some authentic Cyprus cuisine expertly cooked, including some lesser known dishes such pastirma (cured, spiced beef). There is a wide choice of meats, fish, and salads. Unusually for restaurants in Nicosia, they also offered low alcohol beer. And of course, there is ouzo. It is situated away from the center, so it is a place to go searching for (and worth the search) or to drop in if staying in one of the nearby hotels.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"The portions were big with a good tasteWe ordered zucchini balls, Greek salad, chips, feta pie and octopus plate.Tasteful and delicious.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,The food was nice but the one of our dishes never arrived. No one noticed until we asked for them to remove it from the bill.They could improve a bit on the service.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Staying at the hotel next door on business and for a few cold days, we had no incentive to go anywhere else. Everything we tried was good, and even on a busy night when they were fully booked later on they fitted us in. The atmosphere of a Cypriot taverna with no frills, really good food (fish or meat), generous portions, pleasant English-speaking service and reasonable prices.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,Very good food and service with a warm atmosphere. The place are very welcome to the public and nice to visit them.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"We visited one Friday evening for dinner with friends. Although such restaurants are known for offering mezedes in their menu, this one didn’t. What a disappointment!!!! We spent considerable time deciphering the dishes from a menu packed with un-necessary info.The staff was friendly and fast, but the quality of food was average. Will not visit again.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,"Located in the Hilton Park in engomi, this restaurant serves the best Greek Food, food market or mezze, had the best Greek food so far, friendly service and great for large group of people …..",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"If you want to taste Greek food this place is ideal. The quality of most of the dishes that we ordered ranged from very good to excellent and the prices were, on the whole, reasonable. However, the ventilation of the place needs to be looked at, as one's clothes are left with a not so pleasant smell of food.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,The place was good. I would have preferred more herbs and/or spices in the dishes. Meze selection impressed more than the main courses.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

The food was so wonderful that we ate there four different times. The staff was very friendly and our meals arrived in a timely manner.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"The food was tasty and came on time. The ambience was good and the staff was very helpful. The only negative is that the ventilation was not good enough and when we left, our clothes smelled like food.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Excellent food but a few setbacks. Waiters in a hurry to serve , as a result no time left between starters and main dish, like they wanted us to eat as fast as possible and get out of there. ThEy should be mor3 careful with their timing. Food quality was excellent and highly recommended. On a busy night it can be crowded and noisy",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

20,People are trying to pass it as traditional greek ouzeri but all they do are serving low quality fried dishes. Sometimes i wonder if the chef is tasting the food. The atmosphere is nice though despite the heavy smell pf burned oil.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,"I visited the place for lunch, It was my third visit. Just like the previous two times, we ordered several starters and salads, as well as a couple of main dishes to share. I quite liked the starters and the salads who were innovative and tasty, but the main dishes were average or sub par. And especially taking into account the price of each dish, I find that there are better options out there with more reasonable prices, given the large number of places offering these type of cuisine.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,I 've heard a lot about this place so I decided to visit it...the atmosphere and the decor are great so as the service. We try different starters and all were delicious. The main plate was just good,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Since the first time we visited the restaurant, we always stop by the Elliniko for dinner when in Cyprus and Nicosia for either a holiday or a business trip.Once again, we enjoyed our dinner with a good selection of amazing appertizers and salads and great tasty main courses. Friendly, polite and lovely staff; especially Savvas, he is a truly professional! We do like the modern with the traditional ‘Greek Style’ decoration of the place. Until next time...the Elliniko is an excellent choice with a majority of Greek dishes! Thank you for taking care of us!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"You will not be let down ... if you are after very good service and consistently good food. It's not off the charts by Michelin standards (unlike say Pyragmena which by Cypriot standards is unique) - but I've never having now gone many times been disappointed, and the food has a certain high consistency. If I had an important business lunch in Nicosia other than Skinny Fox and Pyxida, it's where I most obviously would head to just for its very good service and food quality which never disappoints.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,Had a business dinner Good choice of food. We shared a few dishes and wine. All well cooked and very tasty but all seemed to sort of taste the same. I would go again but not a gourmet type Greek restaurant.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"All what we have ordered was exceptional, nice atmosphere , waiter was very friendly , all was perfect",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,some foods were excellent but some others seemed they were not freshly made . generally it was ok.the service was very good.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"We have visited the restaurant with friends. The place looks nice. The menu was not very exciting, we had a difficulty to choose from the menu. We ordered 4 different dishes from classic calamari dish to some new combinations. The taste was disappointing, all 4 of us agreed we would not visit the place again. There is just nothing special or even satisfying about this place.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"I’ve eaten at this place and ordered it home. There location is nice but there isn’t much of a view. The food takes a good 15-20 minutes to be served depending on your order. The the fish and meat portions were smaller than I expected, but the taste is there. Overall I do recommend.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Very good food. Selection of salads, hot and cold appetisers and different meat dishes. Friendly service and very good value.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,It gives me another dimension to Greek crusine. Love the fried goat cheese and the grilled sardine fillets. Wish I had more companion to share the food with as there are so many more dishes which I love to try.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
10,Waiter suggested because we were with our child we should be placed at the back of the restaurant so as not to bother anybody.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,We had an occasional visit to this establishment and we really enjoyed our time here. The service was great and the food very delicious,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"The restaurant is very well located near big hotels, coffee shops and other restaurants. The service is top class with gentle and quick waiters. Whatever we tried was really good. Prices are a little bit to the high side but affordable. The decoration is cost and exactly what you expect from a taverna. The food selection is big and varies to suit all tastes. Highly recommended",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Everything that we ordered (and we tried many plates from their menu that offers a wide variety of choices) was very tasty, well prepared and nice looking. The service was fast and effective and the place nicely decorated. Something you suspect during the meal and you feel after the meal is that some dishes are overdone in salt and spices, and that may produce indigestion to sensitive persons.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,Medium to low quality which makes it even more frustrating if you consider the high prices! This place is seriously overpriced for the quality it offers. I don’t know if it started well and now the quality is deteriorating.. I can get better food in my neighborhood’s kebab place. Also they have only one choice of wine in a glass.. calling it “house wine”. Terrible! I didn’t even see where it came from! There are loads of taverns in Nicosia.. Don’t waste your money on this one…,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"We visited the restaurant for dinner with family - the selection of dishes is good and the ingredients are fresh.I strongly recommend chicken Souglaki, village salad , kolokythokeftedes,However Sone of the portions are rather small and the prices compared to the portion is high..However I will visit again with my family we overall liked the quality.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Super nice and clean interior, very professional and polite staff, and the food is indeed great. Inspired by northern greek (thessaloniki's) regional cusine, but also including many products (cheese, meats, salads, omelletes), and recipes from across greece's culinary tradition, the place is probably the closest as it gets to tasting good quality traditional greek dishes and meze. A fine place.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,A very traditional place that reminds you Greece but also serves you GREEK food that you think you are in Greece. The staff is amazing as well as the food. It's very good and i will be visiting it again very soon as it's AMAZING.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,"It’s always a pleasure to eat at this restaurant and there are too many things to choose. It’s a bit expensive, but it does worth to try!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Very nice place, favourite place of our cypriot friends. The kitchen and dishes are very greek (don't mix with cypriot!) but 4 stars are only for one disadvantage - I was driving hence not drinking (cypriot people used to soft drink when driving but we, belorussians, don't at all) - there were no options for non-alcohol menu. No juices, no packet juices, no even tea! Only cypriot coffee, water and drinks like local Fanta, Cola and Sprite.But if you drink - it's 5 stars and awesome )",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,This is a nice casual place where you can enjoy very tasty starters which you can share.dishes with cheese and feta. I recomend the pork chop and pork souvlaki with nice fries Prices moderate I recomend it for a nice casual night out with friends,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,The restaurant is always nice and clean with helpful personnel. The variety of Greek food but there is an inconsistency on how the food is prepared. Sometimes the meats are really good and the rest is average and sometimes the opposite happens. General I am very satisfied with the quality and the prices. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a good Greek restaurant around Nicosia.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Excelent service, top quality food, and overall an amazing experience!Highly recommended for casual or business eating!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,"I have visited To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio many times before but always as a ‘regular’ customer.I therefore know the food, .... and I know it always delivers in both taste and quality. Never have I been with a group though but we decided to give them a chance for our business outing.Boy, did they deliver !We, a group of 22 people, arrived a little early but this didn’t matter to the kitchen as before long the dishes started coming out. Yes, we agreed a menu up-front so the kitchen knew what to expect .... but it usually takes time for a kitchen to get up to speed. Not here ! .... delicious dips and small starters were put on the table in no time, the drinks arrived .. and people were getting comfortable ... having a great time.From there onwards .. it went only crescendo! Given that we had many foreigners in our group, we decided to go with a nice selection of typical Greek food. I don’t know if a Greek restaurant finds it harder or more easy to please foreigners (as they don’t know what to expect) ... but I personally was very happy to observe that all the Cypriots present (I’m Dutch myself) were really impressed by the food. And our foreign friends were also blown away.To put a long story short; we had a great evening. The service is excellent ; both friendly and professional ... no request seems to be “too much” for them to handle.I recommend for you to give them a try yourself, you will not be disappointed!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,After trying almost all dishes ! we really enjoyed seafood and especially the baked sea bread and small meze like salted/ Marinated fish really tasty!!!!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Unsusual decor, modern with a touch of old greece. Scrumptious is the only word to describe whatever emerged from the kitchens, salads and dips and souvlaki - could not reach the dessert stage as the appetizers filled us up.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"First time we visit the place , the place is very nice really reminds us places from Greece , original greek food nice atmosphere ane polite and friendly service",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,Excellent service and great atmosphere! Very nice food and drinks. Recommend for families and couples!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"I have visited several times, mostly with family and also foreign guests for business lunch or dinner.This is one of the few places in Cyprus where Greek food actually resembles the one you get in Greece, includes many old-school traditional dishes, all the meats are well cooked (pork chops, chicken souvlaki and fillet are juicy and delicious, never dry), although there is a tendency for over-salting…The variety is great, there is something for everyone, but it may be confusing to choose from such a long menu.The staff is fast, polite and helpful, the atmosphere is unique and a sort of an entertainment by itself, can get quite noisy though and the lights are too strong to my taste.As for the price, you can easily have a filling tasty meal on a budget, but if you fall into the trap of trying-out a selection of several hot and cold dishes with your ouzo then you may be unpleasantly surprised with the bill.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"I visited the place with 2 colleagues as we were staying in Hilton Park. Fava was top, seafood risotto great, giants mediocre. Service was fast and staff was very friendly. I recommend this restaurant.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"I always like to eat the food of the country I’m in so headed straight for Elliniko. The food is excellent, but beware, the portions are huge. I have had dinner there 2 nights running and have really enjoyed everything. I recommend a glass of ouzo to finish off. The service is nice too.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"It wasn't what it was expected to be; thoroughly underwhelmed expectations. Food was neither the best in its category, nor the cheapest, nor memorable, nor worth it. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's ok if you're there and you're getting something fast for the road but I wouldn't plan a night out there.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"Just a food, some of it was too salty, some overcooked, some tasteless. We took Armenian pastourma (too salty and the garnish didn’t compensate its saltiness), grilled octopus (which was dry and chewy like a rubber) and sardines (tasteless and dry). Never go again and do not recommend anyone at least if you are not starving or have no choice.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Been there twice the past 12 months and theie food is amazing, service is great. The only thing i would change is that they bring the food too fast. It would be better if they paced it a bit.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"The food here is delicious! greek , mediteranean taste and aroma in all dishes. you can either have a main meal or share different kinds of small dishes, like a meze. but not with traditional meze dishes like in greek taverns! Ellinikon is one of a kind. Not a restaurant, not a tavern, something between!The staff is excellent, help a lot and are aware if you need something! They are very kind and the mananger is a Great Guy !! :)Souvlaki chicken was my favourite, saganaki, ravioles and the cheese with honey!I also tried some of my brother's giaourtlou which was very nice even if it wasn't my taste.I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!!!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"First and foremost, we have to be clear that this is a typical Greek (i.e. Greece as opposed to Greek Cypriot) meze restaurant. The difference is that you pick and choose what dishes you want to eat, as opposed to the stereotypical Cypriot meze (where everything is already chosen for you). It's just how I like it. The service is great and, on a Saturday night there was a real buzz about the place, people enjoying their meze with family and friends.With such an extensive menu, there really is something for everyone. I cannot wait to go back.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"I visited the restaurant many times, either with friends or family. Every time we left very happy, enjoyed our meal, the taste, portion, combinations. The staff is always friendly, smiling, willing to help even the most demanding, hard to satisfy people like my mom :) by suggesting dishes, what's new, or according to the person's preference. Another nice thing about it is that there are options for vegetarians and vegans too so this will not stop them from eating out with their meat eating friends. As vegan, ask for 'nistisima'. I usually take fava or peas or bins, aubergine with tahini, kipos tou papou salad without cheese. I would suggest for vegetarians the zucchini balls and the saganaki cheese with crust and honey on top they are both very tasty!! or one of the fish/seafood dishes. As meat eater (when i visited the restaurant 2 years ago) i remember I liked the chicken souvlaki. Worth the visit, make sure you reserve in advance and prefer visiting on a weekday for a more relaxing atmosphere.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Very pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff! The food is very tasty! Whenever i am in Nicosia this restaurant is our first choice. Even if we couldnt decide, the waitors were always helpful with suggestions. Worth the price but make sure to make a reservation especially during weekends!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"The food came fast and it was well cooked.mostly meat dishes and fried calamari. The salad was fresh and the staff polite and welcoming. However, we were seated next to the door and it was freezing cold. Also, the smoke from the smoking section kept creeping in and it felt like we were sitting in the smoking area to be honest.Dessert was fine too. We had a couple of pieces that we all shared.Again the food was great and the quantity,too,but it was expensive. We paid 30-35 euros per person with no wine. Just soft drinks and a couple of beers.Additionally they only serve esspresso and cyprus coffee. No other hot beverages which was a pity sincevit was so cold outside.Overall a nice place but you can't go there regularly.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,"On the strength of past experience, the “To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio” is a very nice place to go for a meal. So there we went again for a Friday dinner and did not live to regret it.Always, it is imperative that one books one’s table several days in advance, as demand for this restaurant is high. On the plus side, booking a table is a simple and hassle-free process.The place was spacious, very clean and decorated in a unique way. The waiters were very pleasant and courteous and service was very efficient. The starters (Dakos Cretan Salad and Kolokithokeftedes) and the main dishes were first class: nicely cooked, very well presented and very tasty; what is more the quantity of the main dishes was enough to fill even the biggest stomach.“To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio” have lived up to, and enhanced their reputation. We look forward to going there again!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

30,"The food was nice, but not great. Staff were very attentive. Restaurant is quite big with a varied menu but not particularly cheap. Ate better meals away from the hotel.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"I had a solitary dinner there - having there on business alone. The place is large enough so it didn't matter very much. The menu offers both fish and meat, and quite extensive too. I took grilled sardines and they were absolutely fresh as well as beautifully presented. For a hotel restaurant, I could not fault.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,The original Greek cuisine at your plate. The cuisine is immaculate. Small treasures at your plate. Little bit expensive but for that taste you have to pay gold. If you taste the original pasturma you are going to thank me.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,i have visited the restaurant several times over the last 6 months. The service is excellent. the food is traditional and tasty The service is excellent,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,The best greek food! Its my favourite option for lunch during work days!If its for weekdays there are many options for the quick lunch offer (12:00-16:00) where you can combine different appetizers with different main dishes every time! My favourite combo is the aggourontomata salad or kolokythokeftedes with chicken fillet or souvlaki which are considered as healthy options since are cooked on grill!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,The food is very good and the service is excellent. It is very good for a casual or a business meal.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,The food was mediocre to good. The oil in the salad was tangled and smelled awful and the “yiaourtlou kebab” had a strange and unpleasant smell. Potato chips and chicken kebab were super. Desserts were delicious and service was OK.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"Nice menu with delicious, freshly made and tasteful dishes but the price and quantity is disappointing",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Excellent food and fast service. Very polite waiters and very professional! I have been a regular customer for 2 years and the food is getting better and better! Keep it up!!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"We were staying at the Hilton and we really didn't have many options and thought why not try this restaurant. I had the grilled calamari which was very nice.

50,A different view of Greek cuisine with dishes not found easy elsewhere. It was a nice surprise visited with family,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"A modern Greek cuisine restaurant situated inside Hilton park Nicosia as a part of the second restaurant of the hotel (with Japanese Akakiko). Serving delicious salads cold and hot mezze dishes and dips and a big selection of Greek local cheeses. For main there is a great selection of meats and fish grilled and oven cooked in large portions.Excellent restaurant and fast service. Average prices, and upscaled place. Loved it",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"We were there last week, OK i was really frustrated as i couldnt find parking nearby. When there is a wedding party in the hotel, dont expect to find parking nearby. Anyway the problem was my food, i ordered this beef with mashed potato, called a name i cant remember... meat was not too hot, and before i finish my dish the meat was cold - maybe the kitchen staff didnt reheat it enough :) we were offered desserts and it was a nice gesture but really i wasnt excited.. better luck next time for me. The staff was very helpful and the manager was a nice guy but ....",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,"Have visited on many occasions. These guys maintain a good quality consistency (the number one criterion for great restaurants and the one at which most fail). Mouth-watering Greek tastes, fava beans, black eye beans with dill, pastourmali, a variety of Greek cheeses,agiorgitiki tigania, oven baked sardines and many more.... If you like authentic Greek tastes, this is a great choice, possibly one of the best you can get in Cyprus.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,As usual the food from the starters to the main and the desert reminds us the real Greek food with emphasis to Crete island. The food was very good and the service perfect.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"greak greek tastes we tried the calamari skewer, the mushrooms tigania, pork tigania, salad, and a few more all was delicious!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,Very nice place with nice setting and smart decor. Service was good as well. However the food quality and quantity was average especially at the prices offered.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Exceptional Greek cuisine, menu reminds me my trip to Santorini and Paxous Island's.That was my first time visiting this restaurant in Nicosia and for sure i wouldn't except to find this kind of dishes in Cyprus.This place don't serve the classic meze dishes but as the name says it serves authentic Greek dishes that you find in Greek islands.A variety of salads, grilled meals and seafood, what drove my attention was the seafood section with plates like fava from Santorini and seafood barley.I choose the Kritharoto barley risotto with seafood and it was delicious, presentation and taste was amazing.My new favorite place in Nicosia.Definitely recommended.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Absolutely perfect food, all the dishes were very tasty. Very good service and polite staff. Just one parameter that can be improved: we seated at the terrace facing the main road and our plates (although facing upside down) and cutlery were dusty. It would be better not to have the tables already set up but prepare upon guests arrival.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Very pleasant environment and friendly staff that offer quick service. Perhaps the music should be turned a notch down at times. The menu has several options from greek cuisine, not too many, but still enough to cover more than one visits. Prices on the upper average side. Portions are very good. The food is well prepared and delicious, reminiscent of modern greek restaurants. With the exception of the salad, which was decent but not something in particular, all dishes (in our two visits) were memorable.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,we have had nice food here the staff was also friendly and was very close to our hotel which was very convinient,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,nothing in this place made me say WOW !! I tried this place wishing to have a real taste of the real greek cousine which I have enjoyed in Greece but I was wrong ... nothing special ....just an average local restaurant ...,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"A great restaurant with a wide variety of dishes and a selection of wines. You can enjoy all the classic greek dishes with a twist. On the downside, the portions are a bit small so its better if you order a variety of dishes and eat as finger food with your drinks.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Excellent service. Good quality food. Pleasant environment. Convenient parking inside the Hilton. Classic Greek dishes originally cooked.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Very good restaurant in a greek environment. The staff, especially George Konstantinides, are extremely polite and professional! Ask for his suggestions on food. Try also the traditional Greek deserts",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,We visited the restaurant on a Sunday for lunch. The food was very nice and also the atmosphere very good. Though the place was full there was a lot of space for us to move around and the chairs were not packed! The prices were within expected range and the desert was complementary! Would definitely visit again soon:),To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Ate meze style with friends. We picked from the menu rather than ate a set item meze (Cypriot friends selected). Food was excellent. Service was very friendly. Modern decor that was perfect for lunch - lots of windows for good lighting. A little more expensive than small neighborhood taverns but I would not place it into the high price category of some restaurants.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Delicious greek food, very good quality and well cooked! A bit expensive but it worth it! They have a big variety of vegetarian dishes also and good greek wine! We 've tried the zucchini balls, the cheese croquettes, the eggplant, the octopus, the sardine and the greek salad and all of them were very well cooked and prepared!Good service and nice place also!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"This restaurant was advertised in our hotel magazine.It was just next door and so we decided to try it for our evening mealWe were the only ones in the restaurant at around 7pm, however all local restaurants were nearly empty.My partner had the Pork Fillet that was absolutely delicious. I had the Mixed Meats minced kebabs.....again, absolutely delicious as was the minty sauce accompanying them.Service prevented this from being a 5 Star experience.8 staff were visible (including 2 in the kitchen)They did not seem to be aware that we had finished and did not remove out plates for some time. Appreciate interested that dining should generally be a leisurely experience however they were more intent on having a chat.....2 groups on different sides of the restaurant. All visible.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,Nice restaurant that is attached to the Hilton Park hotel. Great freshly cooked food that is served by friendly staff. It gets busy so a reservation is needed for the busy times of the day and early evening.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Three of us had dinner at “To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio”. The place was nice, tidy, clean and decorated in a modern way. It was quiet too, a fact that made it conducive to a quiet evening out. The staff were very pleasant, courteous and facilitative in helping us to make our selection of dishes. Service was very prompt.A wide variety of Greek food was offered. We ordered Dakos Cretan Salad, White Taramas, and Kolokithokeftedes for starters, followed by Marinated Chicken Fillet with Greek Pitta, Pork Bacon glazed with dark honey sauce and fries, and Kebab Yiaourtlou as main dishes.They were all very well presented, very tasty and very stomach-filling.All-in-all we had a memorable gastronomic experience and look forward to revisiting “To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio”.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"One of the four or so restaurants in the Hilton Park Nicosia is the To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio, offering Greek mezze dishes. It was always my understanding that mezze are small dishes, hot or cold, spicy or savory, similar to Spanish tapas. The operative word is “small.” The dishes I ordered were anything but small – but humongous!Before ordering, I was given bread and a small complimentary dish of potato salad with a light mustard dressing. I normally do not like potato salad with mustard dressing, but I found this version to be quite tasty and would order the appetizer version listed on the menu (€5.50) if I were come again.For what thought would “small” dish appetizers, I ordered the Armenian pastourma - highly seasoned, air-dried cured beef (€5.50) and an order of pan fried fresh mushrooms with cognac and balsamic vinegar (€6.50). This would be followed by my “main course” of horiatiki – a country style salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, olives and feta cheese (€7.00). I also ordered a 650ml bottle of domestic Keo beer .When the pastourma arrived, there were 8 pieces on top of a huge amount of what appeared to be politiki – a cabbage salad with carrot, celery and red peppers. This was surely enough food for 2 or 3, after all, I expected this to be an “appetizer.” The pan fried mushrooms were hot and very tasty. I would have ordered another if I didn’t already have the pastourma and the horiatiki salad was still to come. The horiatiki salad, like the pastourma was quite large, enough for 2 persons sharing.The offerings were tasty and the service was fast and efficient with no mistakes in my order. I could only finish the mushrooms as the two other plates were large. My waiter offered to put the remains in a take away container. I later placed it in my hotel room’s mini bar cooler to keep it from spoiling, so I could eat it the next day.I would definitely come again, if just for the pan fried fresh mushrooms with cognac and balsamic vinegar.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Very Good for a business meeting. Very tasty small dishes but we had to pay 94 euro for 4 persons per visit. Plenty of parking, very pleasant personell",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"I had a business dinner here. the place is a little too loud for business conversation, but may be OK for casual dining. The menu is very extensive with a very lengthy selection of cheeses and dishes from all over Cyprus and Greece. the descriptions are somewhat cryptic so its better to have someone local with you who can explain the food.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Supper the first day, lunch on the third day;We had supper here the first night we are in Nicosia on business and lunch on the last day before heading to the airportGreek Meze!Salad, different of fish in small portions, chicken, lamb, dips, fried cheese etc.What can i say!I can go on and on.Good food at reasonable price.I will be back:-)",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"The best restaurant in town especially for lunch! Every time i visit Elliniko is getting better an better. Atmosphere is really nice, the staff are friendly and always taking care their customers. The manager is absolutely the one every business is looking for to hire, he knows what he is doing. He's a gentleman, period. I definitely recommend it to everyone who likes good food and great atmosphere.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,I have visited a number of times this restaurant but this time the food was a great disappointment. One of the dishes was ice frozen although cooked in the outside. The service was good.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"Nice atmosphere and interior, good personnel, but... Food quality is Very inconsistent!The very same dishes that were exceptionally tasty 2 days ago, today were very very mediocre and disappointing! The restaurant must have at least 2 different cooks, nothing else can explain this! The one who was doing the shift during lunchtime January 12 should definitely be praised! Zuccini keftedes melted in the mouth, saganaki had beautiful flavour, liver with caramelized onions had just the right amount of sweetness to the dish! However, lunchtime January 14 presented us with almost burned, dry zuccini keftedes with sour dip, shrimp saganaki had a very sour tomato sauce on dry shrimps, and liver with caramelized onions was sour as well! Basicalky all dishes tasted the same.. Disappointing! But if you want to take your chances, maybe you'll be lucky to come to To Elliniko when the better chef is on duty, then you will be glad you did. However, take a sandwich with you just in case",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,Warm place which reminds an old grocery but in a modern decor. Plenty of greek tasty dishes. You can choose between cold and warm appetizers and a main selection of main dishes. Staff was smiley and friendly. Not as expensive as I heard!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"It was a must Greek dishes cuisine.Selections of fish ,meat cook and serve the Greek Orthodox way.Big variety of Salads and big choices of delicious small dishes.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Even after the bad experience I had yesterday at a restaurant in Nicosia, I was attracted by this place when I arrived at the Hilton Park hotel because the place appeared to be so cool! So I wanted to try Greek food again! I ordered a platter with 3 meat and it was indeed a good choice. I finished the entire dish and the bread they provide as kind of a starter. (Those bread tasted well with the gravy they had on the meat platter).Absolutely a very good place! Service, cleanliness, taste... everything was almost perfect!!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Great variety with several dishes.Usual starters with tasty saladsMeat dishes are nice, not too cooked but tasty!Decoration is OK a bit not so authentic as it shouldAll in all they offer a nice selection of meat, veg and fish dishes for all tastes.Recommended.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"I could clearly undestand that ""mezedes"" stands for small portions, however charging a small portion for a price of a normal meal is not a good idea.Either they have to drop prices so we can order more variety, or they have to increase the size of portionsRegarding the taste, is not a typical Greek restaurant if you have eaten in Greece, is more like Greek atmosphere with a local taste.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Very nice open plan, new style tavern. Very nice taste of the traditional Greek cuisine. Good service!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"This was our first time at this restaurant and we were impressed! I've been reading the comments for 'To elliniko' quite a long time now and I was not sure if this place is really good or bad due to mixed opinions. We decided to go and see for ourselves and good we did! First impression is the professionalism and politeness (without being too much) of the personnel. Our waiter (pity i don't know the name to mention it) was very helpful with our order and very friendly! The menu is extensive and we need some guidance in terms of how many dishes we have to order and the portions in order to neither exaggerate or order less than we should. We had a salad with rocket and despite the fact I'm not so much into rocket I liked it. Then had the Talagani Messinias which is similar to Cyprus halloumi and we found it delicious and the feta cheese in crusty dough with honey which it was amazing! For mains we shared the Agiorgitiki Tigania and the calamari skewers with a kind of bulgur pilaf both mouthwatering! There is an extensive selection of ouzo which we 'd chosen from! Food was coming on time, it was freshly done, service was flawless and value for money! We are looking forward to going back and try more dishes from the menu! Don't just read some of the average in rating reviews here, just go! You will not regret it!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"This is my favourite restaurant in Nicosia. If you are looking for quality greek meal that is genuine together with nice service and an excellent price then this is the place. I have been here so many times and it has never failed me in service, delicious food and value for money. I have had the pleasure of dining here with my friends and family all of whom have walked away with high praise. As I said, I have been back many times and will continue to do so. I obviously have no hesitation recommending this restaurant to everyone, locals and tourists alike.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,Elliniko is a good restaurant butit is noisy - too much noise in the main room. they have to do somethingInflexible - they have kebab portions with 3 sticks! and we were 4 and there was no way we could order 4 sticks - the same with souvlakiService was average - asked for Cypriot wine and they offered us greek options!!Food was goodSweets - average - typical and always the sameIt is always full and i guess they must be doing something good because it is not a cheap restaurant,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"very nice little tavern with menu in greek and in english..very interesting menu, a bit different from the usual meze with tasty food...and deserts :) lovely house wine at very affordable prices...friendly staff...the only thing I don't like (and I get annoyed each time I go there ) are the table with rounded feet...which mean you have to seat sideways and try to squeeze your feet somewhere...",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"A must for every visitor in town and for local too. I had a business obligation 2 days ago and all 25 colleagues from all over Europe were excited! Each time I visit is better than last time! Congrats to all, management and staff. Delicious plates, excellent service, best choice ala- ellinika in town.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"This was our first time to this restaurant and it will probably be the last.The nice setting reminds of Greece and sets a very high standard of expectations for the food and the service.Unfortunately the actual experience was anything but! Service was amateurish with almost all dishes mixed up between the 4 of us. What was worse was that the service felt ""cold"" definitely not reminiscent of Greek or Cypriot hospitality.Food was ok but only that.....We won't be going back any time soon.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"We were staying at the Hilton Park Hotel so decided to eat here. It was clear that the restaurant is part of a chain as everything is very professional. The menu has a vast choice. We had potato skins for starter - don't be misled, they are actually new potatoes boiled in their skins, a huge portion. For main we had the pork fillet which was one of the best pieces of pork we have had in Cyprus and the stuffed sardines which were beautiful. The house wine was fine. The service throughout was excellent, the staff were knowledgable and helpful. The price was very reasonable. Would definitely recommend this place, it is really different from the normal Cyprus taverna.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"Reproduction of a Greek taverna offering authentic Greek dishes at quite affordable prices. Connected with Hilton Park with possibility to find easily ( free ) parking. Large menu to choose from. Accurate and friendly service in a pleasant atmosphere. Actually I read many excellent reviews about this restaurant so I am sure they can cook well and probably what occurred to me is just a mere accident. In any case a chef should check all the dishes which are getting out of his kitchen and he should not allowed a ""burned"" dish to reach the customer ! No need to give any explanation ... just have a look to the picture I posted along with my review in order to understand what I mean. I was not in the position to reject the dish; I did not want to make any controversy and I ate it all the same. Just a pity.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"This is your typical ""ouzomezedopoleio"" meaning a place offering small dishes to accompany ouzo or in a wider sense any drink... Well cooked delicacies or raw dishes based on traditional recipes.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Had a great night at Elliniko! We had a meal with family and friends. Started with excellent mezzes (one of the best tzatzikis I ever had), which were followed up by the meats. The lamb and the chicken were really good. Excellent atmosphere and great service. Definitely a recommendation!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Two days in the city and we visited this restaurant two times. The food is absolutely great and the service is friendly and efficient. Definitely the best restaurant we have visited and it is warmly recommended!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Previous Friday I had the pleasure to be a guest again at To Elliniko. Our group was 60+ guests and therefore probably had an impact on staff and kitchen.Quality of food: I have never been disappointed with the food served at To Elliniko. This Greek Meze is compared to the Cyprus version absolute A class. Obviously there are personal preferences but in general it is very good. They take care of every piece of the menu and that is praiseworthy.Hosts: It is not easy to handle a crowd of 60 people and serve their food at the right temperature almost at the same time, but Mario and his team did it.This restaurant is absolutely one of my favorites in Nicosia.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"To Elliniko is so good .. It is Unbelievable!I have visited this restaurant several times during my last stay in Cyprus. We always liked it .... As part of our wedding we therefore wanted to organise a dinner (a day before the actual wedding) at To Elliniko for 60 of my friends. Spoke to the owner beforehand to discuss a budget and gave him freedom to create a menu that would suit locals and foreigners.From the moment we entered drinks arrived at the table and soon after the food came out. It was simply delicious. The starters to share were so good .. my friends kept on raving about them! Then the mains arrived and again people were so happy. The quality of the meat was sublime ; not dry at all and perfect in taste! The chef has really taken the Greek cuisine and put his own mark on it without losing any of the traditional elements. He must be so talented.What surprised me most of all was the consistency of the dishes and the way how logistics were handled. Every dish arrived at the same time at the table, looked stunning and tasted the same....for me it is mind-boggling how the chef and kitchen managed to deliver such high standard for such a big group of people.I can't thank the waiters, staff, chef and manager enough for adding such a special touch to our wedding!I will return , maybe not with such a big group :)) ... But to Elliniko definitely will always be a place for me to come back to and revisit those happy memories!Modern Greek food to its finest !Recommend to all whether you come by yourself or with a big group.Richard",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"ok I will be honest. It is not as good as the same restaurant in Glyfada (Athens) that I often visit... but, for Cyprus standards its very very good. Nice atmosphere, good food preparation. True Greek experiences from the islands, the north, pelloponisos, crete and Cyprus.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,I love this place. A wonderful selection of dishes to suit every taste and great value for money. I'm vegetarian and it's wonderful to go to a restaurant and have so much variety to choose from. Last time I visited I was with a bona fide carnivore and we both felt spoilt for choice. The fava is incredible and the mushrooms were the best I've ever eaten.The service is great too - friendly and attentive. One of my favourite restaurants in Nicosia.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,"Adjacent to the Hilton Park, so loads of free parking. Nicely laid out with indoor and outdoor seating. Extensive menu of mainly Greek and Cretan dishes. Seafood very good, but meat dishes a bit underwhelming. Best thing about this place is the beer called Fix.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
10,"The grilled 'talagani' was the first thing we ordered that arrived to the table- it was cold. At that point I thought that maybe that was a fluke and the rest of the food would be decent...but unfortunately it was not the case. My pork souvlaki was pink, the fries smelled of burnt oil, the 'politiki' salad was completely wilted and had too much salt. The list goes on. However, my most serious concern relates to misselling- we also ordered a 'mosxarisia brizola' (beef steak) which I am quite convinced was in fact a pork chop of some description put on the menu at at a considerable mark-up (€16). The waiter reassured us that it was beef however I remain unconvinced. I can't recommend this place I'm afraid. Don't be fooled by the agreeable decor, this is essentially fast food quality sold at a premium.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,"We had dinner here -as a couple- on 2 evenings :July 11 AND 12 .We stayed in Hilton Park Nicosia last week so this restaurant is only 20 m. walk from Hilton Lobby via inside corridors...Location saves on taxi fare which will be spent on food as the prices here are a bit higher than normal in Nicosia town (on tourist level or for people with expense accounts ??)On our first visit July 11(table 11) the manager proposed us as a tip several deepfried items and stuffed potatoes which we declined as we were looking for more typical cypriotic kitchen. Name is a give away : this is Greek food centered around mezze :))We ended up ordering 2 starters based on eggplant ( 1 hot / 1 cold) and our entrees with my wife taking grilled kalamarakia= squid skewers(3) and me ""kebab giaourtlou""= minced meat mix grilled on skewer!Our starters came out rather fast and both were very tasty , sliced brown and white bread came in basket and was refilled . Entree for my wife came out but after 10 minutes my entree was still missing. Despite several waiters and at least 2 managers serving the restaurant it escaped their attention and we had to request where my missing main course was . Meanwhile my wife slowly had to start her cooling skewers, eating alone, while I waited for my food. Manager on scene excused and kindly offered a free dessert to make up for the gaffe...My kebab came out when my wife's plate was empty so now she enjoyed me enjoying my kebab which was tasty ... After the meal the bill came out but the grandiosely promised free dessert never did make it to the table and I did not want to ask for it either ... Manager seems to have a bit ""short memory"" problems if he can not keep track of such promises ?? Total was about 38 Euro.Second meal on July 12 (table 52)was less chaotic and the 2 starters as well as the 2 entrees made it on time to the table . My wife had her usual squid skewers as she liked it the day before , I went for Mprizola ... which was a big veal chop . Menu claims it to be 400 gr. , probably when it was stil in packing paper and untrimmed but taste was good and protion ok so lets not haggle too much even if 16 euro is probably more mainland price than Cyprus price? Total for this evening was app. 45 euro .Suprising for us was that on neither evening the manager of To Elleniko offered us a cyprus coffee nor any sweet or fruits after spending a nice amount for diner so guest service here was more than lacking !!Check can be charged to Hilton Park Nicosia room so that made it a bit easier ...",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,"We were staying in Hilton Park and therefore decided to try this restaurant as it is located just next door and offers Greek cuisine. We were extremely impressed, the food by its one deserves a 5 out of 5. Portions were massive, so we got full after 2 appetizers already. Overall we have tried about 6 menu items and all were extremely delicious, made out of local ingredients, including lots of tomatoes and feta cheese. I would also like to mention tons of vegetarian options in the menu which I was extremely pleased by. Staff did not seems to go ""extra mile"" though, despite suggesting several menu items for our taste, which we gladly accepted. But it does not spoiled our overall experience, so we will definitely be back!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Very good service, polite staff. However, not any choices as side dishes for your main course that are not charged extra which is very inconvenient. For example, you can not change the potatoes in a dish with rice or with something else. You have to buy it extra. Also, they could offer a treat on the house at the end of dinner such as fruits, a sweet or something. Does not cost anything guys!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,Went for dinner with customers Nice big location also with dehor Great mix of different greek dishes from salads to feta and suvlaki Definitely suggested,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"the restaurant is beautiful and will please any tourist but the standard is not what I expected knowing the greek cuisine, it is more industrial than homemade, in Cyprus restarant owners pay more attention to the place than the food",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,A place where you can emjoy greek mezedes with emphasis to Crete food. The service is good and the staff very polite,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Exvellent service in a nice atmosphere and quite an interesting menu with wide choices. Very interesting mix of authentic dishes which were rasty and enjoyable. Sure recommended for a good night out,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"It was an overall good experience. Staff was polite and friendly and the restaurant modern, in a good place with a nice view. The portions though were too small and the prices high, so was a little dissapointment.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"A clone of our favourite restaurant in Thessaloniki (same name), To Elliniko has a very extensive menu of Greek - not Cypriot - dishes. Whatever we tried was excellent, as was the service. The decor is interesting but the layout isn't as cosy as we'd like and the place can be very noisy.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Lovely Greek Food and service. i was impressed by their lovely Greek dishes and desserts alike. will definitely go again!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,We decided to revisit this restaurant to see if it has improved since our last visit.We had lunch on a very busy Saturday; we noticed three major improvements; first the reception was excellent and the service was very fast and provided by a very well trained staff; second the 4 main course dishes were served at the same time; and finally they opened a smoking area which made our experience more relaxing and enjoyable.Thanks to the management for listening; we can claim that the restaurant now that the food and service are perfect,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"I've visited Elliniko many times in the last 6 months. I waited until now to write a review because nornally all new restaurants try their best at first until they are established and then they try to cut costs on the expense of the quality and quantity of the food. This is not the case with Elliniko. For six months I noticed that the food was improving while the prices were not changing. For example the smoked pork was a bit salty and gradually they managed to control the amount of seasoning. Additionally the quick lunch menu was a nice surprise with a variety of dishes, meat, salads, poultry paying aproximately 9 euros per person and have a full meal.The food is really not expensive. The secret is that you have to be careful about the amount of food you are ordering. The menu has an incredible variety of dishes and it can be confusing. First time I visited the place with my wife I paid around 30 euros per person and there was plenty of food left untouched. I had them pack it for take away and my wife and I had it for lunch the next day and there was still leftovers. Next time I visited, I asked the waitress to help me with my ordering and the bill was approximately 15 euros per person and still had a small amount of food left on the table. Bottom line ASK THE STUFF TO HELP YOU.The stuff is mainly young people acting exactly how I like to be treated as a customer in a greek taverna. Friendly but also professionals. Attentive but also discrete. Well done boys and girls!On the downside the place can be really noisy and crowded during the weekends and people who like peace and quiet should prefer visiting the place during the week. Additionally they should consider adding more options for desserts.Overall I believe that this is a restaurant that fits my needs and I hopefuly they will continue maintaining their high standards.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,This place reminds you of a grocery. It has a nice atmosphere and the service is good. Kind waiters and staff. There is a large variety of different dishes. Taste of some food could be improved.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"First visit to this restaurant. The food was disappointing ,especially the lamp with sausages which was tasteless and the lamp chops which could not be chewed. The decoration was very nice and the service slow. Nicely decorated restaurant but too noisy. much better Greek food restaurants in Nicosia at much lower prices.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"The atmosphere is excellent! It's a big and comfortable place, full of traditional foods and drinks found manily in Greece but in Cyprus as well. There's a big variety of cold and hot dishes, salads, drinks and sweets. Everything we tasted was magnificent! There are dishes originating from every corner of Greece, such as Macedonia, Metsovo, Crete, the islands, Volos etc. All well cooked, accompanied with great side dishes, such as tasty potatoes and sauces. The service was excellent, providing every help we needed and there was no delay in preparing and bringing our ordered dishes.One thing missing was some low-volumed music...",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"We visited To Elliniko several times since its inauguration; the food was mostly fine with few exceptions, but the service was below standards in every aspect; the waiters were doing their best, but they lacked the experience, and the food took very long to be served.The worst thing was serving the main course for each guest separately with 15 minutes gap between guests; we had to wait for the last dish to be served; making the food cold and inaudible. The first time we experienced this inefficiency was on Saturday and the restaurant was full; so we didn't complain, but the last visit was on Tuesday; we were the second table, still the 3 main courses arrived 20 minutes apart and we finished our lunch in 2 hours where a total of 10 guests were served by 3 waitresses.There is no doubt that the service team needs experience and training, the kitchen staff need better coordination internally and clear communication with the service staff.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Food is good, service is ok, atmosphere is good as well, price vs value is not good. A little commercial products quality. Local tavernas are much better in terms of value for money.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"The place is within the building complex of the Hilton Park, Nicosia. Parking can prove tricky because the hotel parking is on the other side and street parking in the vicinity is shared with the sushi place next door. It is busy place and they maximized capacity by crowding the space with tables. It is what I call densely populated.The décor and the ambiance are nice and pleasant, although the noise level is a bit high.We visited the place with friends who recommended T-bone steaks (veal chops). We ordered 5. The three were ok, but the other two were anything but acceptable - cooking was as ordered, quantity was ok, but the quality was barely acceptable. - with extensive marbling - (intramuscular fat or intermingling of fat within the lean). We complained and, to their credit, we were asked if would like something else. We said no and they compensated us by not charging sweets and coffee.The bill was in the region of 25 per personThe staff were excellent, friendly, efficient and responsive.I will visit the place again and try mezze",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Excellent! Wonderful food, excellent music, nice music, excellent service and very nice place! It's worth to go with friends or family!!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"The location is easy accessible. Plus it's a positive fact that it is not directly adjacent to the main road and parking is easily accessible and free which is not the case in Nicosia anymore as many parking spaces are unfortunately privatized. The interior design is suitable for a Greek mezze place, the waiters are polite and attentive and there is a good display of gourmet products to purchase if desired. However it would have been nicer if there is a bigger variety of products focusing more on Greek produce or from Thessaloniki region which directly relates to the food instead of yet another place that also sells Cypriot produce. A further speculation and study on the products provided for purchase. In regards to the food which explain the poor-rating is that the portions are very sufficient for a mezze but the quality of food is very average. We would rather pay the same price for their dishes, but have a smaller portion and invest more in the quality of the ingredients used. The flavor component needs a lot of work to be satisfactory. We felt that it was lacking a lot on seasoning, the use of Mediterranean herbs and good olive oil. We also felt that some of the components of the dishes were prepared a lot of ahead of the serving time and were just assembled therefore not as fresh before they are to be consumed and for the amount of people in the kitchen this did not justify it. They were well executed in presentation but the quality has a lot of faults. It has an interesting menu and an interesting choice of dishes put up together so we would really like to try out more of the dishes but for the meantime we won't be going back until we hear from word of mouth that the quality and freshness of food has elevated itself. Also if we compare to a lot of the new pop up local restaurants in Nicosia, for the price we paid, we can get better food, better quality and more quantity elsewhere. We couldn't finish all the dishes because they were huge portions for mezze and at some dishes it was unnecessary to have such a large portion especially when it's a dip as a starter, and this didn't give us the chance to get a more variety to try because of the expense and portion size of every mezze dish.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"Our experience here was average, as we didn't enjoy the food very much, even though the atmosphere is great. A few examples of the dishes we had are ""Kebab giaourtlou"", and this is served without yoghurt (!), which is actually funny and pretty unbelievable. We also had pita with traditional chopped sausage in it was full of oil, and this make it hard to enjoy. We also had zuchini-balls and those were tasty. Also, small pork-chops with carob sauce wasn't anything special.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Traditional Greek food in modern surroundings gives this restaurant a relaxed, cosmopolitan feel. Portions are big so even though you're meant to order a few fishes they are much larger than tapas so pace yourself. Service was very friendly and efficient so overall a thumbs up.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,A very good Greek style food that is serving fresh authentic tastes. I would be happy to come back very soon.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Very tasty food and looking same with the pictures very good servis and managment. For sure i will come again!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"All the food was fresh and tasty , and professionally cooked, great selection of wine and meze. The service at this restaurant was probably the best we've ever had. Would fully recommend this restaurant.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,Its been said that the greek meze is all little dishes. Here is not the case its more like portions so be careful with what you order as the food they bring is alot. There is alot to pick from the menu as they have a wide variety of different dishes. And try their barreled wine its verry good. Good for couples or with a few friends.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"Very popular, very crowded and very noisy! Interesting decoration, very friendly and fast service despite crowds. Wide selection of Greek mezedes consisting of meat and fish dishes. Well presented, good size portions and very reasonable prices. However taste-wise the dishes we tried were very average...not the real Greek thing but a good imitation. Lacked that special touch that could have made our dining experience memorable.Desserts too were below average. The low prices seem however to be the main incentive that keeps this taverna full.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,Really tasty authentic Greek cuisine although a bit too salty at times. Nicely decorated restaurant but too noisy. Excellent service from the staff.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"If others find this restaurant the best North-Greek experience in town, then they must have never been to Thessaloniki. Yiaourtlou was just a joke, with over salted meat on plain pitta and a tiny side sauce. Small fried fish gavros, served plain without anything aside, no salad, no chips, not even lemon! Chips are pre-fried of course, forget the fresh. Tsipouro was served in the correct tall glass but with ice in it, which is wrong if you are not asked first, because many people (like me) drink it straight. Generally the place is nice, the food options are many (i doubt the quality though) but certainly not even close to a good Thessaloniki tavern.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"We visited the place on a Saturday night with a couple of friends. The place is brand new and it comes directly from Thessaloniki where they have similar restaurants.It is a huge place to start with and it was packed.As you can understand service was struggling to deal with all the tables and the orders but overall we didn't face any serious issues or delays.We got some starters and a meat platter to share. The starters are expensive but the portions are huge so be careful. Don't overdo it especially if you are only 2 persons. If you are more than two then the big portions are exactly what you are looking for.The food was really good. Well-cooked, finely seasoned and it tasted really good. It reminded us of good food in Greece.Overall it was a good experience if you are prepared for the crowd and the noise. If you are looking for a quiet taverna with music, then avoid it",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"I have been visited twice ""To Elliniko"" so far and I am really enthusiastic about the authentic Greek mezes that they have.... Warm atmosphere, excellent service and unique Greek dishes!! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to try tasty and good quality food.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"In general the quality of dining in Cyprus is not of the highest standards. In 3,5 years there have been very few venues that have pleasantly surprised me with their menu, style, ingredients and taste. To Elliniko is by far one of the best experiences I've had on the island. It is recommended for everyone.Please, order fish and you'll know what I mean.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
30,"“To Ellinikon” offers a huge variety of Greek dishes. I chose Yiaourtlou; alas, it did not prove to be the “real” Yiaourtlou as served in Athens; this one was the Cypriot version it seems. The kebab on the skewers was tasteless. Also, instead of it being served on a pitta bread spread with tzandziki and source, it came on bare pitta bread – the tzandziki and sauce were contained in a small cup each, in what was not even a sufficient quantity.The place was spacious, clean and tidy. The atmosphere was rather noisy, a fact that was not conducive to having a peaceful dinner. The waiter was helpful and service was good.All-in-all an average experience.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,- If you happen to be in the area - do not miss this place- It is a really nicely decorated restaurant- Great quality food- Nice choice of Mediterranean delicacies- Portions are great- Service is good- It is part of the Hilton Park Nicosia so if you stay there it is very convenient- All in all i would definitely recommend it... You will not be disappointed!,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

50,Living in a different city is a problem but when I have the chance to visit Nicosia I always have a dinner at Elliniko. The restaurant is very clean and the decoration reminds me a modern Greek tavern. The food is very tasty and the service is excellent. They have a variety of dishes so I am sure you will choose something good.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Been there twice so far. Loved the dips in the appetizers section, especially the Fava and the Melintzanosalata which are unique and different from what you will find elsewhere and honestly the Kolokithokefte was the best i have ever had! I had fish for a main and the waitress recmmended the grilled Sardela which is one of their most popular dishes and i believe it was totally worth it. I also tried the Kritharotto with seafood on the other occassion i visited, which was good overall, although i believe it would have been better if it was combined with tomato sauce. Definetely worth revisiting, especially if you are looking for traditional and unique Greek food you won't normally find at a regular taverna.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"I visited last month with friends. The restaurant was very clean and tidy, the service was excellent. We had few people serving us and they were all very polite and smiling. The food not only tasted FANTASTIC but also came on time while the restaurant was fully booked. They have a variety of dishes (which makes you want to try them all) to suite every need and thumps up on the deserts. If you go there make sure you go on an empty stomach. I will be visiting again soon !",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,"We will go again to try more dishes as seems to be interesting. What we eat was tasty, portions were small (chicken souvlaki and pork pansetakia were not enough for 5 persons) but we were not too hungry so was okey.Atmosphere was warm and homely,decoration unique,service excellent and prices reasonable. Recommended.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"The restaurant is in the heart of Nicosia, and features a modern take on the traditional decor which creates a fresh space and immenses you in the true mezedopoleio experience. Make your own meze (dishes to share) and taste the most delicious Greek food made with the best quality raw ingredients. This is food to fall in love with and don't forget dessert..! Try the baby shrimps, the aubergine wrapped soutzoukaki, the zucchini fried balls, obviously the dakos, the white taramas, or taste some traditional Greek cheeses with your ouzo for an authentic Greek experience!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

30,"Nice looking place, prices, portion sizes and service were, mostly, OK but food disappointing.The Cretan dakos was good but at 7,00 euro, it was a rip-off. The fried mushrooms were drowned in sharp vinegar, the melomeno pork fillet was overcooked with an indifferent sauce just added on top and the grilled sardines were too few and, taste wise, nothing like what you would get in Greece (it is supposed to be a Greek restaurant after all). But the biggest let down was the seafood orzo I had. Days later and I’m still angry that a, supposedly, professional chef would not be ashamed to serve such a mess of a dish. A mixture of seafood, some of questionable quality, and pasta swimming in an ocean of oil, with my taste buds wondering why I would be so cruel to them.Unanimously we agreed that it’s not a place we will visit again.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,I had a dinner party there with my friends. the quality of food was great and very tasty nice people friendly environment. Reasonable prices,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"The best by far Greek style(original) ouzo-meze restaurant in Nicosia. Excellent authentic Greek recepies, cheeses, vegetables, ouzo and wine. Well trained waiters and cooks, very decent atmosphere, Open for lunch and dinner, most of the times need a reservation. Very good value for money, prices considerably high.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio

40,"we visited in Oct 2015. i enjoyed the food and the wine. good value for money i think. i liked all the dishes which is amazing. the only think i would change is to put spoons in every plate they serve. they want to do it like in Greece but i think in Cyprus we prefer to have a spoon for each plate served. not to dip in with our own spoons that is. however, nice atmoshpere, food and location. i would go back there again. its also a nice place to take guests.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"For years nicosia did not have a place offering greek food presented like in thessaloniki or athens. this place is the only one which mnaged to get as close as possible from menu to the design. its not fancy or top quality or even compared with greece, but its as close as it gets in Nicosia and at decent prices.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,Attentive wait staff when you need them but do not bother you to much- one of my pet peeves. Food was good. The beer could have been colder but good for being out of the States. Will probably drop in again during my stay.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
20,"The atmosphere was very nice. Service was good as well. Very friendly staff and helpful though, the dish I ordered was a fish- that was so salty it was impossible to eat. i ordered some vegetables in adition so i coulf try to it the fish with the vegetables but it didnt help a lot.

50,"To Elliniko has come to join other contemporary Greek cuisine inspired restaurants in Nicosia like Pantopolio and Souxou Mouxou. Yet its rather more casual atmosphere makes it not so much of a rival as a welcome addition, occupying its own niche. And in spite of it being part of a franchise, Ellinikon has enough character and style to make it just right for a business lunch as well as a family lunch, dinner with friends or a romantic dinner. The crowd (and it is crowded) is mostly young and well healed.While they make a point of informing one that one serves the wine/drinks oneself, service is friendly, efficient and very polite without it being intrusive.The menu is quite extensive with sections for cold starters, salads, hot starters, fish and meat grills and pot/oven cooked main courses. The food on offer is generally traditional dishes with a contemporary/imaginative flair.A tomato and green chilli dip comes with the complimentary slices of crusty country bred.The Village Salad is crispy, properly dressed and comes with very large slices of excellent fetta cheese (creamy and fresh, not the variety that curdles your stomach). Our starters were delicious - cheese baked in filo pastry and drizzled with honey, fried courgette balls (kolokithokeftedakia) oozing with Greek aromas and fresh mint, served with a yoghurt dip.We were so full that we shared a main of grilled calamari. The calamari was perfectly barbecued on wooden skewers (tender and juicy), lightly drizzled in olive oil and lemon and served on a bed of salad.I tried two deserts. Kazan Dipi or burnt cream (no Creme Brule, this) and a cinnamon dusted, cream cheese covered, syrup soaked sponge were good but betrayed the franchise nature of the establishment.All washed down with an averagely priced Greek red (Paranga) the meal came to €30 per person, a generous tip included.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,Good Greek restaurant with choice of traditional Greek and Cypriot meals. Looks like a deli from outside but once inside service is quick and efficient. Food and drink is good value for money. Atmosphere is good and buzzing.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Visited this new comer last sunday. Very positive first impression, nice deco, you think you are sitting at a supermarket's corner watching the deli section! Very cute with good food.I wasn't particularly impressed with my chicken souvlaki I expected it to have a more interesting twist, but it wasn't bad. The presentation was fine and I regret not trying the meze dishes that seemed fantastic rather than the 'boring' chicken.I would recommend this place in general, it's clean, the menu is straightforward and I liked the atmosphere. I'd go again, but not on a sunday! Too noisy! And the food takes longer to serve!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"Let me be honest up front - I had an opportunity to speak with the manager of this restaurant. He is a young, professional and extremely talented entrepreneur who opened To Ellliniko about 2.5 months ago from scratch and wants this restaurant to become as successful as it can be.The concept comes straight from Athens. I've been lucky enough to also visit this restaurant and it is authentic Greek. Don't imagine a 'typical' Greek restaurant called 'Rhodos' or 'Irodion' as both the interior, exterior AND food are quite different. While nothing of the traditional Greek influence has been lost it is an updated version. Imagine a neat deli/open-kitchen restaurant in a more modern setting. High ceilings that display ingredients but do not feel cluttered or dusty. Just super stylish.When the restaurant came to Nicosia a couple of small modifications were made. Some dishes that didn't prove popular disappeared from the menu and others were added. I am convinced the flavours of the food did not change as the head chef is a wonderful Greek lady who worked at the Greek ""To Elliniko"" before joining the Nicosia restaurant. I am not from Cyprus, nor do I claim to know anything about the Greek kitchen but I can tell you I am an avid restaurant person and I am able to distinguish good from bad.The food concept is simple ... it is a kind a meze; lots of small dishes you can select from a long menu. Normally a long menu can be trouble for a restaurant but this is the type of place that needs it .... it allows you to explore the distinct flavours this kitchen has to offer. If you don't know what to choose you can ask the waiters for options ... as part of their training they all need to taste the food before serving.I went here with me and my fiancé's family so we had the chance to try a big chunk of the menu. For us it started with dips ... some a bit more spicy than others but all are unique, very different from the standard Greek kitchen I am familiar with in Europe.Other impressions that stuck with us from our evening: smoked aubergines, little courgette baked balls with a crusty outside and onion inside that tantalised the taste buds; a cheese soufflé that disappeared in no time from the table. And I haven't even talked about the meats ... Or the fish dishes, good quality product and you can definitely taste that. I am noticing that while I am writing this i realise how difficult it is to choose the right words to do the food justice. Simply delicious !The location - next to the Hilton Park - is perfect. I've been driving past the restaurant this week and it is completely full (both in- and outside) every single evening and you can just feel the joyous atmosphere the restaurant ""oozes"".I think it is already well accepted by locals and it will become a Nicosia favourite like the nearby Akakiko. I also believe people staying in the nearby hotels will find their way over and over again. But ultimately it doesn't matter what I say ... I can only encourage you to give a try ..... independent of the insight I had talking to the manager ... the restaurant, chefs and waiters deserve it!",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
40,"Bright, spacious and well decorated with plenty of seating both indoors and out. The food is mainly Greek (as opposed to Cypriot)-and it's all good.

30,I went with the family for dinner. We were attracted by the bright Mediterranean decoration that we have been seeing for a few weeks prior to our visit. The menu has the usual variety of a good greek restaurant. The stuff was very polite and pleasant. So far so good. The first dish arrives. It was kolokythokeftedes. The first one was split by my wife and found a hair in it. It was a shock to see something like this in such a restaurant. The waiter removed the whole dish after apologising and soon replaced it. All dishes were tasty and nicely presented. From our table we could see the cooks in the kitchen. They seemed clean and neat. All were wearing hats. It is still puzzling for us. Maybe it was a once off unlucky event. At the end we would expect that they wouldn't charge for 'that' dish. They did. All in all it was a negative experience for us.,To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
50,"The newest restaurant in Nicosia; it is adjacent to the Hilton Ledra Hotel and Akakiko Restaurant. It attracted us during its construction, and decided to try it.The restaurant is very nicely decorated; is very pleasant and relaxing; the space is perfectly used, the Kitchen is open to the seating area, and the restaurant is surrounded by shelves exposing a huge variety of delicatessen items.The reception was very warm and the service was professional with a great smile; the menu was full of great variety of Appetizers, Salads, Delicatessen Cheese and Meats, Salted/Marinated Fish, Hot Appetizers and Meze, Meat Dishes, and Seafood Dishes.We were offered a Potato Salad and Paprika Appetizers; they were both delicious; the Rocket Salad was fresh, the Fried Potatoes Skins was tasty, the Eggplant Rolls Stuffed with Meatballs and Feta Cheese was unique and tasty, the Cretan Village Sausages, the Grilled Sardella Pantremeni, and the Mussels Saganaki Cooked with Creamy Pepper and Feta Sauce were perfectly cooked and delicious.It is a delicatessen in big portions at very reasonable prices compared to average food in any other restaurant.",To Elliniko Ouzomezedopoleio
