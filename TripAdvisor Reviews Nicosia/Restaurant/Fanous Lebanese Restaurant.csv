50,"First of all the staff are extremely friendly. The food was excellent. The Shish Taouk was extremely good and the houmous was great, 10/10 would recommend.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
10,"Food has nothing to do with lebanese food. First of all wrong order, tabboule is hard, maghmour is sour, the shawarma is chicken tenders, the sauce that is supposed to be garlic sauce is tasteless. The bread of the sandwiches and the accompanying bread is very old. The lettuce in the sandwiches was brownish. Very disappointing!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Beautiful place in a cosy street, kind and helpful waiters. Prices doesn't change for years. Quality of food and service 10/10.We ordered fanous meze, it's 16€ per person. Better be empty stomach becouse it's abundant, the best was tabullach - parsley salad.Meat was well seasoned and tasty.I tried also fresh lemon and mint lemonade-their speciality it was absolutely awesome. Refreshing and tasty, you can add a shot of your favorite alkohol to it.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

30,"Set in a torist side street in down town old Nicosia. Picture on web site looked impressive, but the place is average. Most people were outside smoking with a Hookah/Hubble bubble in very relaxing looking chairs.Service was good although had to go to the bar to pay as no one was around.The food was average and prices reflected this. I would not recommend this location for an evening business meal with clients due to the food, and standard of service.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Was in Nicosia for a few hours for the Cyprus v Scotland football match, and after spending a few hours in the Turkish Quarter, I decided to go grab something to eat before my bus to the stadium.The bus I was getting was parked right on the edge of the old town center, and from research I had seen the name Fanous Lebanese Restaurant coming up now and again.Having visited Beirut in October 2018 and loving it, I have since grown a desire to get a chance to try Lebanese cuisine at every possibility, and could not turn down the chance to try out Fanous.Located down a small side street, it is pretty well sign posted and easy to find.Lovely quiet little restaurant with a pretty extensive menu.I did not have as much time as I wished to have had, so just ordered Hummus Beirut and a beer, which was freshly prepared in no time, and was delicious.I hope to visit Nicosia again in future, and a trip to Fanous for a proper meal will most certainly be top of my list.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

Took us a little while to find it, but once you are there the service is great and the food is even better!The Mezze was brilliant (we had veg version as had been eating too much meat the previous few days) and it was great. Well worth choosing if you want to try something a little different.Thanks for looking after us and the children well. Will hopefully visit again.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

50,"Decided to try this restaurant, a little difficult to find, someone has opened an Italian Lebanese restaurant round the corner so don't get caught out. We went early as our exploring left us ravenous and although it was quiet it had a lovely atmosphere. We ordered shawarma and grilled chicken in garlic sauce. They came with chips, salad and freshly cooked bread/pita. All was amazing, the flavours were delicious and the meat cooked to perfection. Honestly the best meal I have had in a long time. I definitely recommend, especially the grilled chicken with garlic sauce. I wish I was in nicosia longer so I could go back for seconds!!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Excellent food. Amazing service from friendly stuff. Highly Recommended !Professional people serve great Lebanese food.

Fanous is my go to Lebanese restaurant when i go with friends, family and even take all my visitors from abroad as i know the food will always be great. It is a bit hidden, on the quieter sidewalk on the top right hand side when facing Onasagorou/Lidras, just keep walking and you will find this gem. Enjoy your authentic Lebanese food and perhaps have some shisha as well.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"We chose to have lunch here after it had been recommended to us. We were not disappointed. The meze for two was large enough for 3 to share easily. The food was delicious, interesting and tasty.The serving staff were really helpful and efficient. We have eaten in a few Lebanese restaurants previously but this one is far and away the best.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"We have probably taken all our friends out for lunch or dinner there. Great food, nice service, and reasonable prices. Plus a belly dance show every Friday and Saturday night.

50,"There are a few Arabic food restaurants in Nicosia that are more ""bling"", but that distracts from what they should be offering - excellent food.Fanous is located in the old part of Nicosia within the Venetian walls and offers a variety of Lebanese dishes.The food is EXCELLENT and the portions generous. The atmosphere is great and the people serving you are polite, efficient and helpful.On most Friday and Saturday nights there is also a fantastic belly dancer.I can HIGHLY recommend Fanous as a place to visit for beautiful Lebanese food or just a relaxing afternoon with some Arabic coffee and a seisha.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,Have often eaten here on a day visit to Nicosia but experienced a wonderful evening meal on a Friday night before going to Saras jazz club. Was very quiet when we arrived at 7.30pm. By 9pm it was totally packed yet the service stayed at the highest level. Wonderful authentic Lebanese food cooked to perfection.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"The restaurant is located in the old city centre of Nicosia in the pedestrian zone. As such it has a very nice atmosphere due to its setting. There is an outdoor sitting area in the pedestrian zone and an indoor area as well.There is a great selection of Lebanese/middle-eastern food. The quality of the plates is excellent and the food is very tasty.The service is good, and the waiters are always very friendly.You can order shisha (argyle) to smoke at your table. There is also a live belly dancing show on certain nights of the week.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
20,"1) One person from the staff is very rude and unable to serve properly their customers.We asked that our left over food, to be packed for home.He hold a tray and started putting plates into another ones, that still contain food, like he was going to through everything away. Also, really loudly and abruptly, like he was angry with us or something.We reminded him our request, and he said ''Yes, I know.'' And he continue with the same way of collecting the plates with food...2) We ordered ''meze'' which was not a really good decision as the main dish is just 1 or 2, in a small quantity. The rest, and most of the dishes, are just various kind of sauces.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
20,"I have visited here before for lunch and really enjoyed the food so this time I brought my family along. I was embarrassed and wish I had taken them somewhere else. The worst service I have ever had in Cyprus. Rude, grumpy waiters have ensured I will not return again. Such a disappointment.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Any time I think of having Lebanese/Arabic food, Fanous is my first choice ever since a friend introduced me to it about 8 years ago. The falafels are just right, crisp on the outside, cooked well on the inside, all the dips and salads are delicious every time.An added bonus is that the price has been kept to a low, great-value-for-money level in all the time I have known it.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

The food had just the exact cooking needed to make every bite delicious and moisturous with all the spices and flavors.The new addition to the menu was a freshly baked crepe roll stuffed with brownie chocolate which melts in your mouth.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,One of the best restaurants in the town. Awesome Lebanese food. Recommended 100% Delicious shish taouk sandwich.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Whoever is a lover of flavourful and delicious Lebanese/Syrian cuisine and is in nicosia, or better yet, in Cyprus, must go and try the restaurant Fanous.The smells of their narghilè, their food, the arabic music, their decor, they all shout out “Yes Yes Yes!” This is where your appetite will be satisfied. The atmosphere created there by its service is composed just as a night out for a pleasant dinner is imagined and anticipated.There’s always a smile, always a polite, and their prices are according to its quality. But here’s a tip from me, order the traditional Meze for a large tester of their food.I have recommended many dishes but they have more to offer.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"One of a definitive eating encounters in Nicosia. The nourishment of the Mezze was splendid especially the hummus, the service great and I can hardly wait to go once more. I ended a very fantastic night with some shisha and trust me,this is the best place to have a go at smoking shisha if you ever find yourself in cyprus",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Fantastically situated right in the heart of Nicosia Old Town. The service was quick, friendly and efficient. The meal was brought to the table within ten minutes of ordering. The Mezze dinner filled our table with 10 delicious Lebanese plates. I loved their Hummus with chewy pita bread, loved their falafel, amazing eggplant salad, awsome baba ganoush and the best tabouleh salad I ever tasted. Our night at Fanous Restaurant was not just about the food, but enjoying a Lebanese-style night with shisha, tea and deserts overlooking the busy street and enjoying the perfect music and atmosphere. Trust me, this is a small Lebanon right in the heart of Nicosia.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"If you just want to taste delicious Lebanese food, thats the right place to visit! I visited other Lebanese restaurants around Cyprus, but I never had this taste experience before, everything served at this place tastes so much better from other “top class/well known” Lebanese restaurants. Its a nice quiet casual place to visit, and at very affordable price. Pick “mezedes” to try the whole variety! Totally recommend it, enjoy!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"My friends who are local invited me to Fanous for lunch. They like it and now I know why. We ordered mezes and raw lamb meat (do not remember the name of dish). I'm rather calm about vegetables and sauces, but they were really good there, all of us were fond of falafel, it was amazing, the meat was delicious, even bread with the topping was very tasty. Dessert (something similar to creamy jelly) was very light and tasty, went well with scetto.So I'd definitely recommend it and come again!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Unique experience of Middle East food, with very good meat quality and great personnel. If you look for Lebanese in Nicosia, this is place to go.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"This is a chilled place where one can have a nice meal, have wine, play backgammon, and partake of some nargile. It is a relaxing hangout place that is open till late. It is in the centre of Nicosia and relatively easy to find. Thoroughly recommended.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"The food was delicious and the service was pretty good. We tried a variety of salads (humus, egg-plant etc) following the recommendation of the personnel there and we did not regret it.The price is reasonable for Nicosia therefore you shall visit it and you will not regret it.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,Located in the middle of the old town of Nicosia. Served Lebanese food. The meze was ok but the number and variety of plates were small and limited. The service was acceptable too and the waiters were fine. Also you can have a shisha while eating which is rare in other places in Nicosia.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,The food is very nice. Excellent quality and variety. Also is a good value for money. Excellent service. Highly recommended.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Fromt the tabuleh to the fellafel and the shish tawook, fanous is probably the best lwbanese restaurant in Nicosia. Also serves excellent shisha...",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
20,"Restaurant looked nice, grillen chicken and baklava were okay. Shish kebab consistent of a couplet of pieces of burnt nest and Twitter minuscule pieces of tomato.Contralarly to All the friendly Cypriots the staff were unfriendly, throwing the plates on the table and looking annoyed the whole time.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Fanous doesn't try to be a fancy location. The food is very tasty and the relaxed atmosphere invites to just kick back and relax. They also offer shisas that taste good, but are not outstanding",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,Best lebanese casual restaurant in Nicosia center. Quick friendly service and good prices. Outside seatingsand a private room,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"This is my favorite restaurant of all!The food is always amazing, so fresh and tasty! The staff is very friendly and polite. The owner is always there for so many years now. Prices are very reasonable, even cheap i can say. And of course the fresh apple shisha is the best shisha i have ever smoked. Highly recommended!!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
10,"I wish I could say more. I just sat there with my friends for a while. Then flagged down a waiter by initially signing him over (to no avail), then calling and finally almost shouting. Had my drink. Wanted something else but no waiter was in visual or auditory range. So I just got up and went inside to pay when I was ready.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,We went to Fanous restaurant by chance when shopping for souvenirs and were surprised by the atmosphere of this place. Although not looking extraordinary it has its own appeal and the definitive taste.I knew some dishes names like falafel or shawarma and now I can match the taste to the name.I suggest to try Lebanese coffee served with cold water - it has some authentic spices and tastes extremely delicious even in the heat of the day.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Our favorite place for Lebanese meze and shisha. Great staff, very friendly and atmosphere. Every Friday and Saturday we enjoy the belly dance show too. Highly recommended to try the meze. Great price too. Our place to chill!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

50,"We were here with a large group. Dishes kept coming and they were all delicious - the salads, especially the pepper and beetroot based ones were ineradicable. The meat was also very good. The belly dancer added to the atmosphere. I'm from the Middle East and this was definitely one of the best middle-eastern restaurants I have visited lately.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Nice large restaurant located in Nicosia old town with tables outside too. I tasted a typical Lebanese meze. Everything was fresh and tasty. Lebanese red wine ""Le Prieuré"" ( Chateau Ksara Winery ) perfectly matching the food. Very nice atmosphere with belly dance show. Very good prices. Excellent choice. For sure a place to be back on my next trip to Cyprus.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"I chose this place for dinner with a friend, and we were treated to great Lebanese food, an excellent shisha, and a nice bellydance show on top of everything.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

50,We ordered the so-called Meze and so many varied dishes came with all the tastes of Lebanon! They were all delicious and the price was also extremely good! Will definitely be going back!,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"I have visited Fanous several times and I am always happy with the service, the quality of food and the prices. Highly recommended for anyone interested in tasty ethnic food. Being situated in the historical center of Nicosia it offers a nice outdoor sitting in addition to the indoors ""ethnic"" one. The owner is usually there and gives his personal touch to the overall experience. Alcohol prices can be slightly reduced to be more comparable with the very good food prices.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"I have been a regular in Fanous for more than 8 years now. Rami, the owner, has become a dear friend of mine. His Lebanese restaurant offers an authentic experience with tasty treats, the biggest variety of water pipes, and friendly waiters. If you want to enjoy the real vibe of the town, watch the locals with a nargille and a cup of strong coffee, surround urself with the spirit of the old traditions, it is definitely ur place. Great place to make new friends and share travel stories.There's also a bed n breakfast hotel above the hotel.Highly highly recommend! :)",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"I visited this restaurant some years ago and my friends and I came across it yesterday when we visited the capital. Great service, mouthwatering hummus, babaganoush, taboulleh and falafel together with fresh Arabic bread, just has I remembered it before. My friends loved it! We were too early so we missed out on the belly dancers which was unfortunate but we will go back again soon for dinner.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"It is a very comfortable place, situated in the historical center of Nicosia. The traditional food is delicious and I would recommended Fanous Restaurant to anybody... especially for those who love this type of food.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"I had visited the Fanous restaurant with a group of friends and if you are into Lebanese food, then you must pay a visit to this place. There are several reasons why this restaurant had stood out; the restaurant itself is situated in a little area of old Nicosia on a narrow path way in a place unexpected that has character with old buildings and other restaurants flowing down the different side streets, the air is filled with the sweet smell of people smoking Sisha, which you can also join in. The owner and staff where very friendly and polite, with the owner going around talking to the customers to ensure they were happy. We had the meze dish which was all tasty, though if you are a meat lover you may want to ask for extra, as the main course is not on the scale of having a Greek meze.Another one of the highlights of this place that added to the atmosphere was the belly dancer, normally the belly dancers are not what you would expect, but not in the case of the Fanous restaurant, their dancer was very good and on both of her performances she got the customers up to dance making the narrow path way lively with a lot of people clapping and being very happy. We visited on a Friday night.The whole evening was very nice with everyone having enjoyed themselves. I am looking forward to visiting the restaurant again.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,Went to eat with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the starter dips and mixed grill mains.The service is always very good and and polite.Their maxalebi dessert is great and if you are a fan of the shisha then you are at the right place.They also have lots of TV screens so an option to bear in mind when you want to watch football as well as having dinner.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,A great place to spend your dinner time with family and friends! If you like belly dancing go on Fridays or Saturdays :-) Delicious dishes and very friendly staff! Nargile or Sisha is available too!Should you fancy some coffee and relax in the afternoons it's also recommended :-),Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"The restaurant is located in old Nicosia, near the souvenir shops. The place is great, with good food. I expected something more from the meze food. It includes more starters than main dishes. Once a week they have a belly dancer for a short dancing show. The fresh apple shisha is good, but used to be better.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,It's a lovely place to enjoy good shisha and delicious lebanese dips and meat with friends. I should also mention that the hospitality of the owner is just unbelievable - he gave us his portable charger for the whole night to charge our cell phones. thank you !,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Great atmosphere spreading across the street. Food is amazing and portions are huge. Servers are excellent and helpful. If you want the Kebbe Naye, you must let them know a day before so they can prepare it. I did not get to enjoy this, my favorite dish for this reason.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"The restaurant is beautifully placed within the Old City. Very pleasant, relaxing atmosphere, so it is a lovely place to take your time over a meal.The food is different and very tasty and very good value. We were made very welcome and service was attentive.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"This is a nice place in the Old City pedestrian area. It can get packed very easily in the summer cause there are not that many tables outside, so better make a reservation. The food was good, the prices reasonable (16,50EUR for meze and 10EUR for main dishes). Service was also very good. Overall, recommended.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,A place located in the old city of Nicosia actually reaching it on foot..It is in a small parallel road of famous Ledras..I tried it for first time and I believe worth to try it..although the service was slow I would give it a second chance because of the hospitality of owner and all employees and the taste of food! Prices are normal maybe it could be a bit lawer in vegetarian plates..If you don't know what to order try the mix platters..meze..also give a chance to a very cool drink made from fresh lemonade and ment! The environment seems like the original Arabic style so don't expect luxury..but it's okay. There is availability of nargile and relaxing time..I would visit it again with friends..!,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"My first ever review on trip advisor. After 10 years coming here I can honestly say great for family, for friends, going romantic, going solo, food always fresh & quality. Great service, friendly & Rami is the best host ; )",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"We come here regularly and it is definitely one of the best restaurants in Nicosia, food is delicious and the atmosphere very pleasant, service very friendly and prices reasonable. Would definitely recommend it!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Simply put, the best libanese food one can have.I first visited this restaurant a few years ago and remember it was perfect. Now, during another visit in Cyprus, I retourned to Fanous and was very happy to see that their food is still excellent in taste and quality.On top of that, the location within the walled city pedestrian streets could not be any better.Absolutely recomended.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Fanous for me is not a normal restaurant! It is a place for outings, me-time, studying and much more. Staff are friends! Good food! Good place! Variety of offerings! Arabic music and atmosphere. THANK YOU FANOUS!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"The meze is a really good choice, you'll manage to try several dishes of the Lebanese cuisine. the service is really good, additional to the belly dancers that make the dinner even more enjoyable. The prices are not high for what they offer.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Was not the first time, with group of friends. We ordered the usual meze. Was more than enough. Very friendly staff, willing to help at anytime. Very good wifi too. Nice place for football fans as well. On weekends the belly dance makes it more special :) very recommended place. For local prices, food and all drinks in very good prices compared to other restaurants. Recently renovated too.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"It's one of my favourite places in Nicosia with delicious and authentic Lebanese food, friendly staff, perfect Nargile and homemade lemonade. I've been there more than 5 times, tried a lot of dishes from Meze to Shawarma and was perfectly satisfied every time.Friday nights are dedicated to belly dancing, which is also an interesting and worth to see!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Very nice place to sit, with the real feel of middle east. Mixed meat for 9 eur and some home made lemonade are excellent. And shisha is the best one.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,"I attended the restaurant in the early evening and was one of the first customers. Even so, I was given too much time to consider the menu before my order was taken. Food was reasonably priced and of average standard. Thought the alcohol prices were slightly expensive. Again in terms of settling the bill I had to approach the staff. I think had I not done so I would have been left there for an hour!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"A great night with some collegues at Fanous. Friendly stuff, awesome food, asked the recipe for the chicken and the lamp. Great expirience, belly dancing, i would recomend it for a beautiful time, do ask for the mahaleppi sweet at the end, it rocks!!!some food, asked the recipe for the chicken and the lamp. Great expirience, belly dancing, i would recomend it for a beautiful time, do ask for",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"I live in Nicosia and have visited Fanous numerous times over the past few years. The food is usually excellent and the service is very good. The only concern with Fanous is the consistency of the food. Sometimes it is incredible while other times they serve frozen french fries (chips) and the food is marginal. I continue to go back because when the food is good, it is one of the best restaurants in Nicosia. I would rate Fanous as very good but not excellent due to consistency issues.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Excellent hummus, narghile very tasty, good prices.If you can overlook the shabby appearance of the place, the food and narghile is amazing. Probably the best in Cyprus (I am a Cypriot living in Limassol)Nice Belly Dancing also.The only small complaint from all the great salads, and other delicious meat we had there, is that the lamb Kebab smelled a bit to much like lamb.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

40,"I'm currently living in Nicosia because I do my Erasmus semester here. Since I live vegan it's rather hard to find good food in Nicosia even if it's only vegetarian and believe me after one week you won't be craving halloumi anymore...Anyway, I discovered Fanous due to a recommendation from Utopia Collectiva (awesome organic store in 48 Areos 1015 Nicosia) and the food there is amazing! Although basically none of the main meals are veggie almost all their starters are and they are very delicious and plentiful! You can sit outside and also smoke shisha if you like. The only thing that I personally find annyoing is that they have 3 large tv screens showing soccer all the time - this kind of ruins the cozy atmosphere. The red vine is also not the best.Yet, I always felt very satisfied and happy after the meal! I can recommend going there especially when you're tired of Greek food. ;-)",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"A good 10/10 in all areas, staff, food quality AND quantity, shisha, atmosphere and much much more. The Meze is excellent value for money and very satisfying , Keep it up, look forward to commg again",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"The Laiki Yetonia in the old city is the heart of Nicosia.This restaurant offers fantastic food. You can smoke a hubly bubbly (shiha).They have also a non - smokers' corner or you can sit outside.Regarding the children, there is no play ground for them, but the kindness and waiters' spirit to play with them can fill the space.Hummus, tabouleh and the mixed grills are my favorite.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"I'd been itching for Lebanese food since I left Beirut several years ago and was pleased to find Fanous is owned and ran by Lebanese people, so the food is certainly authentic.There are all the usuals, done properly, and the Labneh is first-rate - worth visiting for alone. Similarly the shanklish and muhammara, which many restaurants often overlook.We ordered a quarter bottle or Arak, were told they didn't have any, then they mixed up lots of smaller bottles with water for us. I prefer to make my own, but they got it just about right and only charged us for a quarter of a bottle when we must have had much more in total.Be aware: If ordering the kibbeh nayeh, you must do so the day before. I was disappointed by this but, thinking about it, this means their lamb is fresh (as it should be served raw as it is). I will definitely be back to try that and the rest of the mezze we didn't have room for.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Hidden in a pleasant and tranquil part of Nicosia, the Service is excellent and the food is reasonable and delicious. If you are fortunate to eat on Friday or Saturday evening you will be entertained by an attractive Belly Dancer.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

50,"Amazing setting in Nicosia Old Town. Tables set on a cobbled side street with excellent atmosphere. Food and service were second to none. The belly dancer performed 4 times and really involved the customers - she was a very pretty young lady with a fantastic figure. This was our first time at Fanous, but we will be back - the 40 minute drive there was well worth it.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,The food is so good. The service was incredibly friendly. I couldn't stop eating. I would go back many times over.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,I have been to this restaurant with friends and we have ordered meze as well as draft beers. The beers served were not chilled! Basically was warm beers! We asked from the waiter and he changed them wiyh bottled beers.The food was average! Nothing special for lebanese meze but it was tasteful! The atmosphere was ok! People were passing through the pavement and people there seemed that they were enjoying it! If you around the area there are much more other places to visit unless wwant to eat lebanese food.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,Before we went there we were complaining that we would going to go to sleep without eating! My boyfriend and I were sure we wouldn't enjoy the food! We were about 20 friends there! Omg the food! It was so delicious we couldn't stop eating eventually!!! Loooved the place and we will surely go there again!!!!,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"It is located in the old part of the town and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Great service and friendly waiters who can explain everything in the menu! Meze arrived fast and was very tasty. The price is reasonable, 16 euros for meze. At the end you get lebanese mahalepi which seemed to be 2-3 days old and without syrup. Overall, a very good restaurant though.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,"I went with four friends to Fanous last week and although the food was actually not that bad, the service was terrible! We waited for about an hour before we even got the salads for our Mezes!! After the long wait we finally got our food. Also don't expect the dancing to be much good, it's quite cringey actually!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Visited this wonderful restaurant during business trip. Having had a delightful ""Meze"", with numerous tasty dishes, I was enthusiastic on the delicious food. I can hardly remember on such a georgeous vegetarian meal, a keo beer in addition - this is it!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Great Meal here, with very good service. We decided on the meze as we were a group of six and not all of our party had ever had Lebanese before. We felt it was a good way to introduce them to several different dishes at one sitting & no one was disappointed. The belly dancer was very good and we will definitely dine there again",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"The atmosphere is casual, relaxed and inviting. The place feels like you are in the middle of Beirut and the staff treat you with the same hospitality (of the good old days in Lebanon). The food is spectacular and the Meze (HIGHLY recommended) will leave you full and satisfied, without putting a hole in your wallet and piercing your stomach. This is probably the 10th time I have visited in the past year as it has become a fun place to hang out and people watch whilst smoking a shisha/nargile post meal! Ask for their 'special' lemonade and extra Muhamara dip!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,This place has good food and decent quality dishes. They are not far off the authentic tastes in Middle East. The only bad thing abot this place is the constant passers by who stop and greet the staff every now and then. Quite intimidating when you are sitting outside to enjoy the fresh air and the old city scenery.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,"Its in the old part of town and the atmosphere is great if a little ramshakled,hubba bubbas going at the rate of knots unfortunatley so were the TV sets dotted all around- the Cypriot love their foot ball. However for a casual walk into town with some great tasting food it was worth it.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,We have visited the place a few times and all were up to our expectations. A place were food and keeping the customer satisfied comes before earnings! We didn't know what to choose from the menu and the owner was more than happy to help us. And all these are in affordable prices! A must visit in the old town,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"A restaurant of Libanese food I enjoyed the place with nice Libanese food and sea food in the tourist area in the capital of cyprus Nicosia I enjoyed the taste and the atmosphere of the place Oriental food and Shisha ,Belly Dance at nights of Friday and Saturday nice service in the place Ledras Nicosia",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,Traditional libanese food very fresh in an special surrounding in the old part of Nicosia. Everything tasted very good to very reasonable prices. We liked it a lot even when it is a shisha bar. For non-smokers like us wasn't it a problem because it has enough open space. At shisha is part of the culture.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"nice atmosphere, quite street, not bad food, friendly staff, nice price, somedays belly dancing for free",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Four of us stopped in early evening and had a selection of about 10 starters and the food on all counts was excellent, We treated it as a sort of Tapas and were not disappointed. The service was faultless and the atmosphere wonderfully Mediterranean. We'll definitely revisit next time we're on the island.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"I've been here several times and the quality of food is always the best. Quite large portions, comparing to how big normally portions are in other international restaurans in Cyprus. Definitely recommended! Not special ambience, that's why I usually go during summer season, so I can seat at the patio, but even if you sit inside you shouldn't worry, it's very clean.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Don't be put off by its location in the touristy Laiki Geitonia district. It's the best place I've ever been to in Nicosia for meat-free food, providing Lebanese vegetarian specialities including muhammara and taboule as well as regular Mediterranean dishes like felafel and cheese pies. Great atmosphere and friendly staff too. The vegetarian meze here is first rate.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"It is very traditional place. Food is really good. You can enjoy evening by dining with friends or family or just having drinks (including hot and non alcoholic), while smoking shisha. You might even enjoy very beautiful belly dance, if you lucky (call the restaurant to ask when). Generally its in the middle of the centre of the city and very popular between people of all ages.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,The owner is terrific! So kind and helpful! The food is yummy and the prices is as low as it gets. Visit the place and you will love it,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"If you want just to chill out this is a place to be, if you like hookah is a plus reason to go there. Personally I don't like hookah but is something different to try in old nicosia.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Once in a while you want something different, had enough kebab and kofte. And Fanous offers this, middle-eastern tastes, very well done. You can sit inside or in the street, where local youths come to have their waterpipe, shisha, a relaxed athmosphere. We had: tasty humus, falafel, very good small sausages, and a meat-speciality of which I don't remenber the name.Not that is does matter a lot, but for those who want to know: the prices are low.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"The location is good, in the old town of Nicosia, the ambiance in side may not be great but when you sit outsite you feel that you are in the middle of an arabic suk which I liked. The food is good, excellent variety and if you are a vegetarian you can ensure that your choices will not be limited in this restaurant",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
20,"Not a single dish properly made, used to be great 6 years ago when first opened, but it seems they target tourists who don't care about quality but just fast food. If you are familiar with Lebanese food, you would know this place is a commercialised version of Lebanese tasty cuisine.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"A friend invited me for Arabic food and I thought great, I know where we'll go. We ended up somewhere else - in the old part of Nicosia at Fanous - somewhere I had never been before and I was pleasantly surprised.In the narrow alleys and amongst the people passing by we sat and ordered. We had some of the old ""favourites"" plus some new ones that were recommended to us.The food was excellent, the service was excellent and the prices were great.This place doesn't have the high quality ""looks"" of others, but it is honest and the food is excellent and that's what you come to a restaurant for.One nice touch is that on Friday and Saturday nights, they have an excellent belly dancer.When you are next in old Nicosia, take a trip to Fanous - you will not be disappointed.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"As the title suggests the food is good the price is low. The usual range of kebabs, salads and grills",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"It was my first time at this place as we were overpassing it several times to end up somewhere else. Finally there and in fact it was a very good experience!! Dishes are delicious, and service is friendly and quick! Actually it surpassed my expectations to be honest. Prices are very good and will feel well receiving the bill in the end. We tried many different dishes and ended up paying less that somebody would expect. Now, on the things I didn't like... Although the place is clean, tidy and cosy I could notice stains on the table cloths which means that they don't change the table cloths every time a table empties. This is quite a drawback but it is not something to prevent me visiting again. Additionally, in my opinion, a lifting of the place wouldn't be a bad idea (especially toilets that although clean, equipment was quite old fashioned).Definitely returning to this place and I highly recommend it!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"The service here is great and for a party of eight people the food came quick enough. We tried many different items from the menu, each better than the last - everything is so flavourful. Will definitely be returning!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,The food is amazing and the staff very friendly. We enjoyed it very much! Great place for nargileh!!!,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,This was the first time at a libaneze restaurant and we ordered the meze so we could try a bit of everything. The best part was chicken shish taouk which I will order as a main dish next time I visit the place. It was an interesting meal but nothing extraordinary to be honest. I found the price for the meze (€16 pp) a bit too much for what´s included. I liked the short belly dance show and the location of the restaurant.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Great food in a chilled out environment. Real local feel with atmosphere. Choice on menu was extensive and place was full even in October,still don't know how the pipes work. Would certainly recommend and return.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"A informal & busy place to eat in Nicosia's old town. Fanous is a good eating venue for both big and small groups of people, it has a good buzz & atmosphere about it & it has belly dancing & football on television too!The menu is meze orientated (16 euros pp meat & 11 euros pp vegetarian). If you don't think you can munch your was through a full meze, the good news is you can order individual meze dishes & meat/fish main course dishes. The falafel was especially good & so was the fattoush salad. Food is reasonably priced, starting at 3 euros per dish and the drinks not overpriced.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"During our 5 day stay in Cyprus, we went there twice for dinner. I believe that says it all! We found it by accident. Our noses drawn as over there, because the whole street smelled like apple from the hookah. The food was delicious and the prices just right! Thank you!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"it is a very relaxed place to chill out with friends or even meet friends, enjoy a football game or have excellent lebanese food, the owner Rami will definetely look after you and make sure you are having a good time",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,The quality of the food is very good and it is really authentic Lebanese cuisine. The starters are the best in town and the mixed grill very delicious. Fried potatoes can improve a bit and the amount of garlic in certain dishes.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,Situated near the 'Laiki Gitonia' of the old city centre. The menu offers an abundance of Lebanese meze. We chose a few dips a salad some starters (falafel) and a few meat dishes. I found the dishes a little bland to my liking. All were well cooked but were lacking that extraordinary taste we are accustomed when eating Lebanese. The busy walk way adds to the ambience of the narrow surroundings. The service was fast and curtious.Price per person with drinks was approximately 20 euros.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,A place where you can have Lebanese food in the heart of Nicosia. The quality of the food is not that good but since I haven't found any other good options in this kind of cuisine it remains an option.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"When we arrived to Cyprus, we stayed at the hotel above the restaurant, which is cheap, basic, but very nice and clean.The Lebanese restaurant on the first floor is probably one of the best in Cyprus. The authentic cuisine is exceptional and they also offer hookah. An amazing place for a relaxing afternoon coffee and dinner (there are tables outside, which I recommend). Located in downtown Nicosia, on a lovely cobbled street, surrounded by souvenir shops.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Love this lebanese place. You could enjoy your nargile and very good fresh food. Plus the people who work there are very pleasant, especially Ahmed the ""nargile"" guy!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"This place is lovely, with a lot of character. The food was good, the waiting staff were friendly and helpful and the price was reasonable. Food service was a little slow but it wasn't a big problem",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,The restaurant is in Laiki Yitonia in the beautiful old town of Nicosia. We usually get the Lebanese meze which is amazing. The portions are generous and the pricing is reasonable. The price for narghile could have been a bit more reasonable though. The owner and the staff are very helpful and with a smile on their faces!,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
20,situated in laiki yitonia between buildings and a small walking roadit seemed as a nice choice - but the waiter proved my wrongspoke little greek and had no manners- i asked for a non smoking area but everywhere there were people smoking - even in the inside of the reataurnat - the waiter told me that this is the situationfood was very average - and was very very slow service and kitchen - i had to wait for 30 minutes for the salad to come,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,Well its good but its more a cafe than a resturant.I give it 4 bec of the price.The shawarma was a real shawarma.The owner told the boy serving me to work and not to speak with me !!!! Which is strange among the nice friendly people of Cyprus...Any how it worth a visit if u insist on eating Arabic Labenies otherwise I didnt realy liked the autmosphere.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,We enjoyed the food and service so much that we ate here twice in three days. We visited Beirut 2 years ago and the food in Fanous tasted pretty authentic to us. Really loved it.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Located in the 'Old Town of Nicosia, this restaurant and' the best ever for the Lebanese cuisine! Caressed by the scent of nargile, and the friendliness of the waiters, offers a variety 'of dishes very delicate and refined, to report the excellent red wine of course Lebanese, a small piece of Beirut in Nicosia!!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"A very traditional and authentic Lebanese restaurant; situated in the heart of the old Nicosia City. We thought at the beginning that the service was slow starting, but we were happy that this was the case as we started to receive gradually a nice flow of excellent very fresh and delicious food in sizeable portions. We certainly enjoyed it, and will certainly visit it again and again.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Restaurant is a bit hard to find, but well worth it when you do. You must walk to it as there is only foot traffic available. Meze is great, if you want great Lebanese food this is the place to go in Nicosia.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,We went based on the good reviews and because we enjoy Lebanese food. It exceeded our hopes. The food was really good - everything was really fresh. They have a very wide range of hot and cold starter plus the usual selection of mains. In the end we decided to go with the full Meze for 2 people. It was huge - 10 dishes plus more hot pitta bread bread than we could eat. Every dish was really good so we nearly finished it all. We had a bottle of local red wine which was also very enjoyable.It is in a nice area of the old city (just north of the Town Hall).Very highly recommended.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"I tend to go to Fanous lebanese restaurant, located in the heart of old Nicosia, often and I can honestly say that it serves the best Lebanese food in town. The variety and quality of the food is excellent and I always leave the place ready to explode, having eaten too much. They have a wide array of mezes and main courses, plus dessert, and I recommend that you try as many dishes as possible. The restaurant is not easy to find, situated in the maze of streets in Laiki Ghitonia, but it is very close to Ledra and Onassaghorou street. It takes a minute to walk from the Town Hall of Nicosia. Once you find it, you will go again and again. One can sit outside on the pedestrian side street and smoke his nargile and enjoy the food, or sit inside in the privacy of the restaurant. In any case, you will be thrilled with the food. Well done Fanous. Keep it up.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,it might seem a little strange to get to but most restaurants here in nicosia take a winding side road to find a good place to eat. it is also a hookah bar so if its a soccer game night you might not get an outdoor table.food is great and cheap in price. nice location in old city.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,"In the heart of the city, good specialties but a bit too spicy. The staff doesn´t really pay attention to the customers. Nice place to go if you want to grab something, but not for a romantic dinner.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,Fanous is a bit of an icon in the old town of Nicosia. It serves reasonable Lebanese food and is popular with local dwellers and tourists alike. I went almost weekly but have stopped going because the place has become too popular for it's water pipes and I can not stand the smell,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"We decided to have the meze and wow it was so worth having...... great tasting dishes including one of my own specialities, Houmous, delicious!There was plently of fresh food and it was really tasty.We don't smoke and yet felt when in Rome!We smoked a shisha pipe made up of rose and it was nice, very cool spot in the old town and it gets very busy later... so get your place early if your planning to go. I would certainly recommend it.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
30,Food was nice bit the surroundings and service left a lot to be desired. Messe was not nearly as plentiful as other resturaunts which we ate in.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,We've been there yesterday night and though I didn't booked in advance there were enough free tables to choose where to sit. We sat finally inside and enjoyed the Libanese atmosphere and the delicious meze we ordered! 16euro/each the price of the meze. Meze has a great variety of Libanese traditional dishes and a dessert at the end. All of them were very tasty and we left from there happy and willing to return!I recommend it to all Libanese food lovers!,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,Tucked away down a shady side street Fanous is a real taste of the Levant. Clientele clearly includes Lebanese people. The meze dips are delicious and a little larger than the norm - try the shanklish and mkanek and the excellent Lebanese wines. Make sure you sit outside though.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Located in a side pedestrian street in old Nicosia, Fanous offers delicious Libanese food at very reasonable prices. You can also smoke the shisha or nargileh, very popular in the neighbouring cafes as well. Only problem: tv screens with football, difficult to avoid in Cyprus.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Great Food, atmosphere, service, value for money, perfectly situated in the heart of the old city! I recommend to all",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,The cousin was gread and also food was very nice since there are not many Lebanese restourant in Nicosia,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"I have been there only once on summertime and we chose to seet outside, they have a very good service and nice food but because I even had better thats why i rated very good. Worth to stop and try it while you are enjoying a walk downtown in the afternoon.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Plenty of food, big portions and long menu. Salads are nice, meet can be improved a bit and it's good value for money.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"A more casual arabic dining experience, you can either choose to sit and have a nargelieh and a fesh juice or a full mezza in the old town of Nicosia. Wonderful food and great service, they even offer takeaway. The Tabbouleh is to die for and by the time the meat arrives you will already be stuffed with the generous portions. A definate yes from me (FYI you can even ask them to pack your leftovers as takeaway) If eating in the evening I suggest you reserve though as it gets mighty busy.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Whatever is said about this restaurant is an understatement...you must check it out and believe me you will not be dissappointed. The food is authentic and delicious, really value for money, the service friendly, the atmosphere very arabesque and the smell of the nargileh....well together with the decor you will definetely 'travel' to beirut for a night!!!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Fanous is tucked away in one of the narrow streets of Nicosia old town. The decor reminds me of some of the restaurants in Beirut with inside tables and booths and an outside area. Its one of the few places in Cyprus you can sit outside with your dog and they dont freak out. The menu has all the usual arabic dishes, but with the difference that they really do taste like the original dishes, I sware the shawarma is as good as Barba in Lebanon, prices are reasonable and the guys waiting the tables are very friendly. A night at fanous is the only cure for my lebanese wife when she gets homesick.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Excellent Lebanese food and great service in the center of old Nicosia downtown, close to Ledra's street. Great for couples or family and business dinners. We tried the meze and it was excellent.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"Very popular and a bit of Lebanon in Cyprus. The food is good, service is friendly and the atmosphere is very pleasant, especially in summer outside.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,This reastaurant introduces you to the Lebanese cuisine which is full of rich flavours. I would definately recommend the meze which brings you a range of the most popular dishes from dips to salads and from dumplings to meat. I must admit that I enjoyed one of the best chicken and pork souvlaki I have ever tried. The price is reasonable.Tip: If you visit during the warmer seasons you can sit out on the rocky pathway and enjoy smoking nargile with the waitors so willingfully keep alight with a top up of coal!,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,The restaurant is in a very nice part of old Nicosia. It needs some updating and also the lighting conditions are poor.The food is excellent with plenty of salads.Also the portions are very generous.Price wise is very fair.When weather is nice opt to sit outside.,Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"If you like Lebanese cuisine and Argyle then this is the place to be :)Is nice for Friends ,Family ,Partner ,colleagues etc...we do a once per week if possible all together my friends gathering and we call it Girls night ! he he heWe love the place and feel like homeIt's comfortable,service is fast and friendly.Make sure to call hours long before your arrival if you want to find space available ..you never fill overcrowded it's just everyone books in advance just to make sure they end their night with an Argyle Gathering :)",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant

40,"the food and service is nice, i would go back again",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"Went there for lunch and felt like we were in the Middle East. Great place to relax and enjoy a Shisha, have a coffee or dine. The food arrived fast, was served nicely and was soooo tasty!Highly recommended: Babaganoush, Houmous, Shish kebab and Chichen Shawarma - the best ever.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
40,"I love the cuisine of Middle East and all of the restaurants I tried in Nicosia are good. I believe their food is great and I like the service here. They have good choice of Lebanese wines in various price ranges, their prices are very reasonable. It is a great place for vegetarians as well. Unfortunately, the place itself doesn’t look that encouraging, could be refreshed.",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
50,"The food is absolutely delicious!! The owner is very friendly and polite, and he's there every evening. The atmosphere couldn't be better, and is completely relaxed and friendly. They serve the best shisha in Cyprus, don't forget to try their lemon mint!! The service is excellent. It's visited by many locals. In summer it's often packed so don't forget to make a reservation!!",Fanous Lebanese Restaurant
