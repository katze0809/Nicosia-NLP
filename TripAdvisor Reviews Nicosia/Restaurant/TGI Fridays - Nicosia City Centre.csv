50,Very friendly and efficient service. Huge spacing out between tables inside the restaurant and the food is on the whole pretty nice and we like it here. It is reasonably priced and popular with the locals. The menu seems currently somewhat reduced from last year but still a good option for a night out. Ultimately the service stands out.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

30,"Typical American restaurant with Cypriot taste. Food guru-waiter is super polite as other stuff. Portions are very big, food is not really healthy, as all American food.However I would recommend to try spinach on a side.

50,Went there for a meeting with another person. He had duck and I had the sesame chicken salad. Both were great. The salad was amazing and I felt full after finishing the plate. Did not expect that from a salad.Would highly recommend. I have been visiting fridays for 6 years now and it is always the same quality.5/5 would recommend.Also the prices were very reasonable and not high at all.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

10,"freak show. Our waiter was a lady with a mustache )Steak was disgusting, nachos were filled with mayo, salad was never washed. Payed 100 Eur for 3 person, no one was satisfied with the food.

30,Staff friendly and quick. Great service except one waiter very shouty. Food came quick and steak asked for medium and got medium well but well seasoned. Cheesy mash potato didn't have cheese or I couldn't taste it. Beer very flat. Tried 3 beers all flat. Turn your gas up.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

50,"We had a meal at Friday's, and the restaurant remains consistent. Good food, good portions, helpful staff and good ambience.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,Generally unimpressed by the fact the staff kept all customers in one section of the restaurant and when I asked not to have 5 adults sit in a booth and instead requested a round table which seats 5 I was told that the requested section is closed despite other diners being in this area.I don’t expect to have to explain to someone that 5 adult males will be cramped when there is a much better alternative and in fact easier for them to service.This was on a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was less than half full.Put your customer first TGI.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

30,"TGI Fridays is TGI Fridays. You know what to expect and you get exactly that. Avoid the Mall branch in Nicosia. It's the only one that manages to destroy the Fridays' experience. Last time was served raw steak which was then replaced with a steak with the silverskin on. Not only was it unchewable, it was impermeable to the steakknife as well.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

40,Served by Christos. He was very polite and helpful. We ordered spare ribs and a sesame salad and they were delicious. The only negative is the chairs outside at the veranda. They are too low for eating and we were uncomfortable.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"I went there yesterday with my friends and were really impressed by the exceptional service and delicious food!More specifically, we thought that the quality of the food was high and the service was really fast.

40,It has the classic tastes of the chain restaurants of TGIF. All delicious. But they must be careful for the medium-well degree of the steak.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

10,"My wife and I attempted to dine here Last Tuesday. We were greeted well enough and asked for a beer and a sprite. The server did not quite understand this order and we ended up with two servings of sprite. We ordered, my wife an Italine style burger and I asked for the standard TGI burger. The food arrived cold quite cold. By this time a disturbance began 100 metres down the street and all the floor staf were outside gawping. Some were openly laughing and thought it great fun as football fans began lobbing Molotov cocktails and explosive fireworks at each other! It took a while to have a server pay attention and remove the cold food. My wifes food came and was ok, sadly mine was not - the burger was dressed differently to the first one and was promptly sent away, The next one arrived with some kind of weird dressing on the chips. I quite ascerbically identifeid the problems to the senior person on duty and she promptly blamed the kitchen staff! I plainly told her that it was her responsibility to take the blame as she was in control [?] and for her to resolve the problems. However i doubt her ability to deal with these issues as she had been with the rest of the staff gawping at the terrible events down the road. Yes the riot was very disturbing and not a normal event, however this staff had a first responsibility to their customers and failed to identify their priorities or responsibilities. Most of them were rather young and really did need the guidance of mature management - which was absent this evening. I noticed that some customers had left without paying - a particularly sad evening for many people. There was one bright young Cypriot [I think] lady server who did try and take the right approach - she was saying and trying to do what the duty manager was failing to do - she is worthy of promotion.!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"Not bad. Food was good but not spectacular. Expensive compared to local Cypriot establishments. Ate here once during my 4 month stay in Nicosia. Overall a pleasant but not great experience. However it is an American chain restaurant and when in Cyprus, I'd rather eat in restaurants that I don't have back home.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"I believe the title of my review says it all but I will happily add a few comments, too. The Jack Daniels diahes of TGI Fridays are the top without doubt but actually anything you order is just delicious. Even the healthy choices like the quinoa burger. Never expected it to be so good, and I recommend it 100% to the vegetarians. Another awesome dish which is available mainly around Christmas season is the duck fajitas. My boyfriend had it twice and still talks about it. Cocktails are refreshing and always generous amounts. Prices of the cocktails are very reasonable.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Mine and my sons favorite grilled restaurant serving nearly everything. From steaks. Grills, salads and pasta and mexican. You will find eveeything to your taste. Also it has an extensive coctails/drinks menu.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"On the strength of past experience, we selected TGI Friday's at Diagorou Street for dinner. We did not regret it! TGI Friday's lived up to and enhanced their reputation of being a fine place to eat!Booking a table for five was quick and hassle-free. Given the popularity of the place and the fact that we were visiting on a Sunday night, we followed the wise approach of booking a table several days in advance – a highly recommended practice for a place like Friday's. We asked for a table in a quiet place in the non-smoking area; we were given a table in the big room on the ground floor, which fitted the bill perfectly. Besides, the dining area was roomy, clean and decorated in good taste.We ordered five dishes consisting of Shr + Chi Pasta, Jack Daniel’s Ribs with Shrimp and Jack Daniel’s Salmon. For the desserts we homed in on the Oreo Madness and the Mocha Mud Pie. Everything was fine: delicious, plentiful and of high quality.Service from the waitresses was truly first class; they were courteous, efficient, helpful and always had a smile on their face.All-in-all we had a memorable dinner and look forward to going to TGI Friday's again.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"A very well known chain that does not need introduction. Busy place with people enjoying them selves. Good selection of food with their own dishes. This particular night however, the burger I ordered came cold. The rest of us were happy with their food.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,Great place. The dishes are tasty especially the starters. The cheddar nachos are wonderful. They have local tasty beer . The team is very nice and will do everything to make you feel great...,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,I am never disappointed when i go here. The food is great the atmosphere as always wonderful. I like that they always add new dishes therefore you never get bored with eating the same thing. Definitely will be going again.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"This restaurant has very nice food and it is restaurant with nice atmosphere. There is a great variety of food and special dishes for kids. The staff is really polite. However, it is not a cheap restaurant but I cannot say a very expensive one.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"It's been a long time since the last time I've been at Fridays in Diagorou. We were a group of seven and had been welcomed warmly at the entrance. The place was packed that night so it was good we had a reservation. It took ages for a waiter to come and pick us an order. When he came he was not friendly at all and with an attitude. They served us the starters and before finishing they came with the mains. The table was full of dishes as we were also sharing some of the starters. They were expecting us to pick the small dishes by ourselves and move them aside or at the centre of the table, in order for them to place the main dishes. They didn't come back immediately to pick the small plates so we piled them up at the side of the table (!). Food was average (at the maximum) in taste and quality. I had the pomegranate chicken accompanied by kinoa and salad. Salad had almost no dressing (despite being advertised on menu that had a special sauce). The sun dried tomatoes in the kinoa had a very special flavor a bit strange. We asked mayonnaise sauce as some of us were having a burger and they brought it to us ten minutes after when we were already half way eating. In the end, all of us shared 3 double oreo madness dishes which seems to be the most favorite or most well-known dessert of the place. I found it so and so, as it is just vanilla ice cream sandwiched in oreo cookie and sprinkles of caramel sauce on top. Personally I didn't find it any special and didn't understand what all the fuss about oreo madness is... To me, they looked more like 'ready-made' ice cream sandwiches that they just took from the freezer and placed them in a dish with a sauce. Generally, dishes are overpriced in my opinion, except if you take the set menu choices. It was a disappointment and I'm not going back. Not surprised that the age group preferring Fridays is mainly teeragers and young people (up to 25 yrs old) with maybe less expectations on food and service but more focusing on the fact that is an old times 'trendy' place to go.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Quality of food has been of a good standard for years, very consistent. Lots of diner food, know what you are going to get. However can become expensive easily without drinks. Service good but not warm or friendly.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,"We took two colleagues of ours to Fridays for their birthdays. Not only were we ignored 3 times after we asked for the birthday dessert, When we finally gave up and asked for the bill it took them 20 minutes to bring it to us. Once we expressed how unhappy we were. The manager came out (with the bill 20 minutes later) and told us they needed time.... Still not sure what he meant with that.. We informed them of the birthdays the minute we walked in...so the managers excuse was nothing but pathetic....... Someone should have told us after the second time we asked for the birthday dessert that they were unable to do that.... Instead we were just ignored and after they ruined our whole experience the manager came out with an unreasonable explanation and no compensation of any sort. Horrible service and Terrible manager. I know my colleagues and I wont be coming back that's for sure... way to ruin two birthday lunches guys! #disappointment",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Love the dishes!! Especially the Jack Daniel meals!! I visit the restaurant, in down town Nicosia at least once a month. Tried for the first time the Take away service! Food was warm and quick to make (20 mins). Blackberry long island is a must cocktail! Great experience! I recommend it!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,Best of its kind as an American style restaurant as it is in Cyprus. The quality is at like any other TGI fridays around the world.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,I dont like at all ! The food is not food !!! The waitress are not friendly and polite !!!! Is visible that nobody cleen this place!,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"Took forever to wait for the bill. Literally sat for 2 hours after asking for it, and were kindly offered it as the staff finished their shift and were about to close the restaurant and leave. Still putting the 3 stars because the food was good as well as the cocktails.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Came here and took my lads for some food as we needed to do some team bonding , forgot we were in Cyprus as I went to walk outside into the smoking area and was hit by a cloud of smoke , the food was good and I would defiantly come back. Just a shame they can't sort out the ticket for the parking",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"Friendly waiters... food as you know, is a fast food: steak, burgers but the service was not fast at all... the sauce on the side is tasty, made with jack Daniels...",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Always a good choice for a family lunch. Very well organised, well trained staff, receipies for all tastes, large portions, clean, quick service...excellent!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Have visited this particular TGIF many times.The food is the same as the rest of the other restaurants, but what has made a differences the level of service that this restaurant seems to always have.Whether its the friendly people serving you or the helpful barman that made a special drink for a birthday, it's always been better than the others.They also speak Greek which is a great bonus as there is nothing more annoying when in your own country to be told ""I'm sorry, I don't speak Greek, speak to me in English"" - thats VERY bad.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"We had a meal at the Mall of Cyprus branch of TGI Fridays on Sunday 10th of October 2016. We went there quite late, it was almost 22h00. Service was friendly and staff members were all very hospitable. We ordered, chicken fajitas and a quinoa burger. Nonetheless the food was terrible. We were served relatively quick but the food was unexpectedly cold- almost impossible to eat. We were too hungry to complain but it seemed to us that no chef would not notice the poor quality of the food that was served to us. Moreover, my quinoa salad was complimented by a salad that included, among others broccoli that was under-cooked. I do not think we will ever visit the restaurant there again.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Friday's keeps its standard and uniqueness both with the food and bustling ambience, whether one goes for a cosy chat, dinner with the family or to watch a game with friends. The groups never mingle because ergonomically they are separate in 2 floor +1 closed patio large spaces. The food is very good if you're into grills and sauces mainly, salads being enough for most Europeans as a main. Many interesting choices on the menu and drinks (with free refills of the soft drinks). Don't expect that you'll be able to keep a healthy diet though, it's really not about that.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"We visited with family and friends and we all ordered different dishes, with absolutely no complaints either about the quality of food or services rendered. When bringing cold beer, the glasses came frozen which is added value since even in September the temperature in the capital is in the mid 30's Celsius... Forgot to mention ample parking and the kids really enjoyed their playground within the premises. Absolutely thumbs up for family outing...",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,The salmon plate was extremely terrible as it was smelly due to the fact that it was not fresh. This is unacceptable for the expected quality of such a well recognised restauant that fullfill or must fullfil. Totally dissapointed having in mind the price.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"I went there last week with some friends. We had the 2 courses menu, which was great, value for money. Friendly staff and good environment.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"We were travelling from southern Cyprus to the north for a few days and stopped off at TGIF in Nicosia for a midpoint lunch break.I've been in TGIF restaurants all over the world and this one is no different from the rest, which isn't a bad thing when your looking for some familiarity after a few days of eating the local cuisine.TGIF Nicosia is exactly like the ones you find in the UK, USA and Europe. The decor is pleasant, with a typical Hollywood theme. The staff were friendly and welcoming.TGIF will never win any Michelin stars, but again that's not necessarily a bad thing and it's not what they're about. If you want upmarket cuisine, go elsewhere. If your looking for a decent burger, ribs or sandwich with a cold beer, this is the place to go.The menu is quite diverse and offers up a range of dishes that would cater to most tastes, from classic burgers and BBQ chicken to pastas and pretty good desserts.It was actually refreshing to find a TGIF in the middle of Nicosia and definitely a restaurant I'd return to.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,You can choose your plate from the restaurant's excellent menu. I am sure that whatever you choose you will enjoy it. Of course you can have a drink with your meal from the restaurant's great bar. The atmosphere is something else. The waiters are professionals.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Always a good option if with friends! The food of the restaurant have never chwnged for the last decate but its still delicious ! A big variety of choices, a free refill to your soft drinks and huge tvs for football ,ake the place even more special",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"TGIF is a classic choice and the specific store offers quality service on dishes and service.However, would love to see more vegetarian options of the food style they offer and the service gets a bit poor when the store gets too busy.The last time I visited last week the girl at the door just told me where my table was while the other was clearly happy to take me to the table. I didn't appreciate the first girl as the store was not that busy and she was interrupting the other girl who was trying to show me. More friendliness from door staff perhaps would be good !",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

20,"After having avoided the restaurant for many months due to an unpleasant previous experience, I succumbed to pressure from my family to give it another go.After waiting for 24 minutes before inquiring of the status of our order ( a salad and a medium - cooked burger), we were told that ""this is normal time for an order to arrive and that it was imminent"".To add insult to injury, the Manager of the establishment who was as rude as she was unprofessional, acted very surprised why she was called to attend to us (""is this why you called me out here?"" ...were her words....!!!!!! At the 33rd minute from our order it was finally served.....I was obviously reminded very clearly why I am not (and will never again be) a customer of TGI Friday's",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,I often visit this restaurant with my family. The food is good and the ambiance is nice but there are few things that are not like the franchise in the U.S.A. For example the customer doesn't get free refills on the soda or juice drinks whereas in the U.S they do. Since it is a franchise I would expect that they follow the same rules.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"There are several main excellent dishes. chicken cajun salad, chicken chimachanga and of course steaks. Previously they served veal steak, not only beef. Price range between 17-21 eur. Personal advice: medium cooked, with Jack Daniels bbq sauce, chief's vegetables and rice. Some in-house smoothies are excellent.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Food, atmosphere, staff...just amazing. Every Time me and my boyfriend think of going somewhere to eat, we always end up TGI Fridays. Love the cocktails and the Jack Daniel burger!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"The TGI Friday restaurants are part of a large franchise system, so they are all similar - and I enjoy the typical American concept, so I have been to several ;-)Went here for lunch on a Sunday and the place was full to capacity, with a 20-minute waiting time for tables. Despite this, service was efficient, and the food was served piping hot, so this franchise must be doing something right!In comparison with other TGIFs, I had the feeling the waiting staff here created less of a ""party mood"", than is generally the case - but again, the place was packed, and I would quite frankly rather have service that is fast and efficient than entertaining.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Dinner was enjoyable as always at this restaurant. The food was served without delay. The atmosphere was fun and the staff were very attentive.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

40,"Being a guest can make a difference in one's perception of a restaurant, so in my case this week at TGI Fridays in Nicosia (unaware... of the bill), I can attest that my food was first-class, the atmosphere and service very friendly, and, when my friend seemed to doubt the quality of his food, the manager agreed to bring him another plate: not only he did not hesitate to do so but he even apologized twice! As a result of all the above, I left with very positve impressions.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

The welcoming was excellent! the young lady who met us at the door was very polite and showed us our table. She was also very kind enough to guide us through the menu and inform us of our options and offers available. The waiter was also very helpful and polite. We ordered a rib-eye steak and the New York steak, along with shrimps. The dishes were very good and so were our drinks (ice-cold beer and a strawberry mojito). The prices were very reasonable.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"At Fridays you can find dishes and drinks which are not meant to be healthy but are more geared towards satisfying your taste buds. As such, I’d say they are more suitable for the younger generation or families with kids.Like most of our visits, despite some niggles (overcooked steak, charged for 2nd cocktail even though they had a 1+1 offer and a bit of noise from the children at the next table) we were generally happy with our experience.Prices are on par with what you can expect to pay in most restaurants in downtown Nicosia.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,"Unbelievably noisy, Service so poor... they don't even speak the simplest Greek words like a hi or a thank you! Every five minutes some birthday will break your ear drums.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,Great food and friendly people. Nice flavours and unique cocktails that you wont find anywhere else in rhe city!!! 5 STARS*****,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Went to tgis with the kids for a family meal, we had burgers with jack Daniels sauce, well they were absolutely amazing, banana milk shakes were to die for, the kids had chicken nuggets and chips made with real chicken. The service was first class and altogether I will tgis 5* fantastic.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"i love fridays... i go there many times with my family, because i love the enviroment there and the food..also, the quality of the food is not as old.. i dont know maybe is because the many job the have the quality has lost..i hope and i wish that the quality they have for many years will come back again...",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"First visit to a TGI, and will be the last, cheap food, just thrown on plate, no garnish, poor service, all by school kids ! Basically a reminder of the old little chefs in the Uk!!, they closed down not a moment to soon!I really don't know how these places survive, the toilets were filthy.Never again",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,Nice atmosphere and excellent service. The food was really good and we had a few cocktails as well.. Strongly recommend it..,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Great food! You can find anything you want! Steaks, fajitas, perfect salads! BIG plates full of food! You will never leave from TGI Fridays and feel hungry! :)) Reasonable prices and the waiters very helpful! The big advantage: except from the playground for kids, it has color pencil and drawing paper to spend time until they'll served.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,We went to Friday 's at the Mall of Nicosia with my husband and 3 kids. Children are welcome there. They get their balloon and plate mats with coloring crayons. But! They offer a spaghetti for kids and the tomato sauce provided with it is far too spicy for children!!! My 4 year old kids could not eat it. It was hot for me too. And they have a great play area but next to the smokers zone! So we decided to stay at the non smoking zone instead. Otherwise the food is tasty and the service was great!,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,- Nice atmosphere. - Nice service. - Bad taste. - Bad price. -..................................................,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"We visited Nicosia, could find anywhere to park, so ended up at Fridays. Parking was free if you ate in. Wish we hadnt bothered! My burger was cold, even the processed cheese on top hadnt melted, so I sent it back. They obviously microwaved it, which would have been ok, if they had removed the salad first! My husband had chicken with rice, which again wasnt hot, but the tomato salad was straight from the fridge, was nice, but would have been better at room temperature. We were the first in, but the place soon got busy, and we noticed 5 or 6 people sent their meals back. My burger wasnt juicy and looked, and tasted likeitwas yesterdays warmed up. Never again.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"I had previously been in this TGI Fridays 3 - 4 times but each time it got progressively worse. Firstly it took ages to order the meal, get a drink, get the meal, having to ask 3 times for your meal is not sufficient while staff seem to talk to their friends & found it indignant when you asked for service, awaiting the bill was just as long & when asked if we had any problems they ignored us when we said it was very slow service & pretended they didn't understand much English, I never went back for the duration of the next 6 months I lived there.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"This reviw relates to the TGI Fridays in the Mall of Cyprus in Strovolos as this outlet does not seem to be listed seperately from the one in Lefkosia centre. Conveniently located opposite the cinema, where we had been to see a movie, we were able to walk staight in and get a table. This is a noisey area by the food court in the mall but ok.Service and food was as expected and even though we were the last to leave, they did not seem to be in a hurry to push us out.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,"Let me make clear first that this review applies for TGI Friday's located within the Mall of Cyprus at Strovolos, Nicosia. I am a kind of regular at TGI's. Once every 2 or 3 months. I usually fancy the stand alone restaurants rather than those located within malls. The latter are a bit crowded for my taste. I always start with a Margarita or similar, a starter and a good meat dish. I followed the same routine also in this visit. It was the worst ever dinner at TGIs. I took Rib-eye with shrimps, New York strip, and a salad. Both meat dishes were so hard to eat, I couldn't believe I was at TGIs. Onion rings were tearing apart, and shrimps were cooked somehow that were full of water or not that cooked, or overcooked??? obviously the waiter at the end asked if we liked the food. The answer was obvious. We left half of it. I asked for the manager. He said that it may happen due to the grains and the way the meat was cut. Sorry but I do not care. He offered us the option to prepare one more for us but he said he cannot guarantee that it will not be the same !!!! What a disappointing experience and complain management...",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"On the strength of past experience, we selected TGI Fridays at Diagorou Street last Sunday for lunch in order to celebrate our daughter’s birthday. We did not regret it! TGI Fridays lived up to their high reputation of being an excellent place to eat!Booking a table for three was quick and hassle-free. We were given a table in the big room on the ground floor. Irrespectively of where one sits, TGI Fridays has a special ambience that emanates from the way the walls are decorated in a unique and pleasant manner. Besides, the restaurant area was roomy and clean.The food (three dishes, Jack Daniel’s Chicken, Chicken Fingers and Sizzly Pork with Shrimps) and the deserts were fine: delicious, plentiful and of high quality. Service from the waitresses was first class; they were efficient, helpful and always had a smile on their face.Given the popularity of TGI Fridays one is advised to book a table well in advance – especially so for Saturday and Sunday reservations. Also, if peace and quiet is of paramount importance, then one should avoid Sunday midday as there are too many kids around.We look forward to going to TGI Fridays again.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"I have been at Friday's Diagorou so many times and i was always very happy with the service and the food. But on my recent visit (20/01/15) me and my friends (who are regular customers also), we were very disappointed most of all with the service. The staff were ignoring us!!! Totally ignoring us! We ordered and when the food came the portion of the Sesame Jack Daniels Strips was half than any other time!!! When we asked why the strips are not as many as other times the waitress tried to convince us that the portion has always been that way-which we are sure that it wasn't. After we ate we probably waited around 20-30 minutes to clean our table. Actually we asked them twice in order to clean it and bring us the dessert menu!! We won't go there again anytime soon. Very disappointing evening!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Went there with a friend whilst visiting Cyprus. I ordered alcohol free smoothie pinacolada and when it arrived it had vodka. As im allergic to alcohol it affected me immediately. I Ate chicken and later at night and for two days i was sick. Nausea and diohrea. Maybe it was a isolated situation but this has now put me off. Service was friendly but not professional.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"I been there on the 6th of January (bublic holiday). Ordered as usual,as we have been regular customers for the last years. When the food came it was kid size portions. We were all shocked. I thought it was because of the day since the restaurant was full, but then again that place is always full. After talking with friends who visited the place on different days they all had the same complaint. Regular prices, smaller portions. Totally wrong for such a restaurant. They wont be seeing us again any time soon.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,This place never stops dissapointing. The food is always heavy and drinks are not that great. Beer is never too cold and the steaks never cooked right. Just another western junkfood chain where you pay for the franchise name and nothing else.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"The food tastes great and there is also a variety to choose from.The staff is always attentive even when the restaurant is full, which is usually the case.Value for money and overall very pleased with the experience of eating there. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very enticing!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,Fridays is a restaurant you can find everywhere and the only difference is the staff and the atmosphere. The food in all Fridays restaurants is about the same but in Nicosia you can find stylish decoration and very interesting atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the food delicious. The offers are good but you have to order half hour before you are hungry.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,We visited fridays many times but this time we went for their lunch menu for 9 euros (1 main dish and 1 drink). We ordered their cheeseburger and we both asked for medium rare to well done. Both burgers were cooked more than well done and were almost burned. The burgers were not homemade and very disappointing for their price. A burger from any fast food chain would be better... For sure we are not ordering again any burger from Fridays...,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Friday's in Nicosia is a very stylish place with its ""funky"" atmosphere, attention to detail, and a classic Friday's menu - steaks, burgers, wings, salads. Their lunch offers are attractive. Their well living chicken salad is wonderful.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,It was poor. Bad service not cooked well too expensive for what we have been served. To late for bill not even change to give us,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"We arrived about 7pm on a Friday night, it wasn't too busy, they were very welcoming and showed us to a booth, the staff couldn't have been more helpful even checking that my steak was cooked to my liking when it was served, they couldn't have done anymore to help us, the food was hot and delicious, I had the New York strip steak and shrimp, the steak was cooked to perfection and the sauce was amazing, our kids love this place and the cool Oreo desserts, will definetly be back",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,The food is nice most of the times.... but this place is so so so crowded... We visited the place on a Saturday afternoon (around 16:30) and it was so hard to get a table for 5. Anyway after we sat down the noise was too much!! I love fridays but when i am at the mall i will prefer next time to just get a quick bite at the food court rather that sitting at this restaurant. Service is ok... there was also a mx up with our order but eventually we got the right food quickly.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"I’m quite excited about TGI Friday’s. I really love that place because both food and service are excellent! I have to admit that I really really love the ambiance, too. That rock n’ roll style and the guitars on the walls reminds me of an 80’s band.In my opinion, you can enjoy the best burger in town with their famous “Jack Daniel’s” sauce and the crispy fried potatoes. Also, people who want to eat healthy, have the chance to order from the new special menu with healthy meals, which are also really delicious! Last month I’ve tried their salmon with tomatoes and garlic and I couldn’t stop eating! Moreover, the restaurant is so friendly and it’s suitable not only for families but also for a lovely romantic dinner or a business meeting.Although the atmosphere and the food are great, I believe that the prices are a little bit high but you can find more affordable selections of food if you don’t want to spend a lot!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Not a bad restaurant. Food is acceptable but overpriced. Service is very good and the character of the restaurant is beatiful.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"I went there with the usual standard company of friends that we always go to TGI Fridaysand we had another nice time once again.As usual, the parking next to it was fully occupied and we had to park at another place around 300 meters away. Unfortunately you can't find a free or cheap municipal parking place so you always have to pay 3 euros to private ones whenever you go there on busy weekends.I just wanted to write a new review to point that I had , well, three of us had a new double beefburger dish werved with bacon, fries onions, Jack Daniels sauce on the side and fries which you can change if you prefer let's say rice or vegetables or sthg else and we were all of us amazed. Both by the quantity and the taste. That burger dish was almost perfect and imho nothing to compare with their usual burgers.The service was very good, everything we asked for was brought and most important on time although they were so much busy, and the staff paid the right attention to everybody with all expected good manners etc.Prices at the same levels as we got used to know that they are.An enjoyable night out, till next time.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"First, we were ""greeted"" by two ladies who immediately asked if we had reservations, and indicated quickly that if we did not we would be turned away. it was, after all, Saturday. I would like to take a moment and point out that there were all of 20 people in a restaurant that seats about 300. We had purposely gone very early to escape the crowds. That said, after a few pleasantries and some hem-hawing, they seated us in an area where there was absolutely nobody. We had a very pleasant waiter, ordered and our food arrived promptly, well prepared, very well presented, and at the appropriate temperature. Stay away from the frozen margaritas. mine arrived very unfrozen, and tasted only of the salt on the rim. No lime, no lemon, no liquor. On to dessert. Or the attempt to get one. All of the night wait staff has now arrived and are exchanging pleasantries with one another in one area of the restaurant. Over a dozen wait staff in full view and you can't get anyone to come to your table. We finally got one over, who removed our dishes and said she would be back with the dessert menu, but did not. Finally hailed another female, again no menu. Finally located our waiter, got the menu and again the food arrived prompt and correct. So with such good food, why the poor service? Anyway, I do recommend the restaurant, just be prepared for some waiting. Parking is available adjacent to the restaurant, but you do have to pay.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Typical TGIF food, good quality and tasty. Prices are reasonable. Good location in city centre and mall. The service is really good and quick. Parking available nearby",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"I went to this branch of TGI Fridays with a friend on the 6th September. As always the food was well presented and we both really enjoyed our meals but the service we received by the staff was shocking. We arrived at the restaurant around 5pm and the lady that greeted us was very friendly however when it came to ordering and paying for our food the staff were rude, ignorant and unprofessional. The restaurant was not busy and around 7 members of staff were just stood around by the bar doing nothing. We were waiting for 15 minutes before someone finally came to take our order and then when our starters came they went to the wrong table, this also happened with our main meals too. Another 2 girls entered the restaurant whilst we were there and they were ignored by the staff when they shouted over for assistance. 4 times the girls shouted 'excuse me' before they were sneered and laughed at by the staff and someone begrudgingly came over. We tried to ask for the bill on several occasions but the staff kept running past us and we never got a chance. In the end someone brought it over but when it came to paying after being made to wait for over 20 minutes for our change we took it to the bar ourselves. I could understand the level of rudeness by the staff if the restaurant was busy but there was only 3 other tables in there and around 7-9 members of staff. TGI's always brags about good customer service and experience but I am very upset to say we did not receive it there. As always the food was amazing but as for the service, well, it speaks for itself that we didn't leave a tip.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"I visit TGI Fridays often, this is a good place to enjoy burger in Nicosia. I made the mistake not to order burger and I chose a healthier option, salmon with tomato basil salsa. The rice served as a side dish was awful, almost raw, tasteless. The pomegranate honey mustard sauce was watery. Cherry tomatoes served with basil salsa tasted like vinegar, too sour. The best part of this dish was the big portion of salmon fillet, it was well cooked and juicy. The staff and the management are very kind and helpful. For sure I will visit this place again but I will choose one of their classic dishes.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"TGIs was always difficult for vegetarians. Not much on the menu then, but the new menu is even worse.However, the restuarant will adpat the menu.For instance, I love filled potato skins, but never ordered them because of the bacon. Imagine my surprise when the waiter suggests I can have them without the bacon! I did and they were great. I also had the mushroom starter, but together it was just too much. Last visit I had the walnut salad. No offence, but the IKEA 2.50Euro walnut salad is better.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,I think they have a wonderful cook. The staff is friendly and professional. I am a regular customer there. It's a treat for my family to dine there.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Sometimes the service is good sometimes not good-the steaks can come burned. Very popular with young people and families with young children. Good fun if you are celebrating your birthday as staff sing Happy Bday to you in a unique way.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

40,Very expensive the food is good but but not always one time i order a pork chop and it was burn and with very very little meat the much it was bone not value for money but i believe for two time the year is ok,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Well everybody is familiar with TGI Fridays. In my opinion this restaurant, at Diagorou Street, is one of the best Fridays restaurants i have been to. Service needs some improvement but the food is really nice.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Even thow the food is ok it's too expensive if you consider that it's an american chain restaurant and the portions size.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"My kids really like to go here for a treat, maybe a birthday. I am not so keen as there is very little on the menu I like. I had the veggie fajitas once, but they were a big disappointment. I've tried having veggie starters but they're not up to much. The kids get some sort of burger usually.Big queues. Very slow service. Friendly staff. Much too expensive.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Very good food and drinks, a little expensive but very good service.Beware though of the TGI Fridays at the Mall of Nicosia, Of course the food is at the same standards however the service is just average, honestly. And I am pretty sure on what I am saying because this was the case in all cases I visited their restaurant at the Mall. 3 times in the last months, the most recent last Saturday. I definetely prefer the Diagorou street Fridays !!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

The staff is friendly and the service is fast and efficient. The atmosphere is nice and kept to the American bar standards.Also the kids menu is worth trying.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"There is a good menu with fasting food, e.g. pasta with shrimps, or salmon steak, etc. Also during the week they have lunch offer 9.90euro for main dish, soft, drink and desert. If you take an offer portions are smaller than usual, but quality of food is good. Service is not the best, sometimes you need to wait long time for waiter or your food.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,"1. my pork chops (both of them in both plates) had at least 5mm fat2. asked for additional coke. on table there were 3 glasses empty. so logically waiter either would bring one or three. he finally brought 2!!! not such big problem in fact.3. after bringing the new cokes he never took back the empty ones....4. area was full of waiters but was almost difficult to get an eye on us so we needed to lift our hands and shout like if we are in tavern5. ordered for brownie sweet. what we received was a tough ""cold"" pack of three layers and the area with caramel was so cold that caramel was like cement. what waiter told us when we told him that in mall's tgi was not like this was that its a matter of chef... for god say... we speak about a franchise...6. cokes were more water than coke..7. finally when we were the last table in the room (there are 3 4 rooms in the same tgi and there were totally about 10 tables with customers) they started arranging the chairs away of the tables in position for closing making INCREDIBLE noise. they were not lifting them not even a cm above floor so that we could hardly speak.Will never go there again and will definitely try to reach the manager with an email and on Facebook.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Been there with the family last night to celebrate a family member's name day. Nice atmosphere even though very busy. Courteous staff. But not only the waiter but also the floor manager were clueless about gluten intollerance. They told me the rise I order has no gluten and when I asked to see the recipee sure enough there was gluten in it...the chicken broth. It is best if they do not know to just say so. At least they were friendly to bring me their secret recipee as they explained fo me to see.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,it used to be our favorite place when going out with our teenager sons but the portions got smaller and the prices too high.. Especially salads are very expensive!!!,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"We generally love going to TGIs for good food, pleasant atmosphere and good service.We went to the mall this time and was greatly disapointed with the service. Firstly they took forever to get our cockltails, they made a mistake on our order and by the time they made the correct order the other main dishes got cold. And to top it all up, we odered a second drink half way thru diner, and it came after we had paid for the bill!!!I mean... Seriously ?!!?!?!Very disapointed !",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"The staff were lovely, they pointed out offers and discounts and when I decided to finish my food and drink at home, were very accommodating. The food was average and a little pricey for what was served, but a great atmosphere and a fun alternative to traditional fayre.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,Really good! Just liek any other TGI! Friendly and helpful staff with American style food and American sized portions!,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

30,"The family visited the TGI Fridays at the Mall of Cyprus over the past weekend. We went a bit late for lunch, after 2:30 PM so people were leaving and tables were emptying.The waiter was friendly and courteous. Relatively timely with his visits to our table too.By taking a first glance at the menu it became obvious that whatever our choices, we (a family of five) would not leave from the restaurant with a bill below 100 Euro. Indeed. And the food we chose was neither extravagant nor, as we found out, high quality (unfortunately).We would have been happy if we left with a bill close to 80 Euro, but not 107 (plus tip).",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,What a horrible experience! Service is simply awful!!! Long faces and poor english! Food was not up to standards. We will not be back,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

50,Very nice appetizers. Must try specially sesame chicken. Nice service and always polite personnel ready to serve you,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"We visited on an early Friday evening celebrating work week's end, and the place was rather empty. However the staff seem up to speed, the venue was clean and the service prompt and to the point. The salads/entrees quality and taste seem to have improved significantly. The waiter silently yet promptly refilled our glass of soda. However the most significant change was the steak -prepared to the ordered done-ness, the sides crisp and appetizing and the presentation worthy of the franchise's standards. They even offer 10 euro discount on the next visit if you agree to provide feedback online within 48 hours after your visit. Seems they have taken seriously the customer feedback. Well done!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Never been to TGI Friday Restaurants before and wasn't sure what to expect. IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT. Staying in Cyprus for a week and ate here 1 evening for a friends birthday. The staff firstly were amazing really good service non-stop attention and nothing was a problem. All the staff appeared and sang a song before presenting the birthday-girl with a small cake.Food was very good, large servings and free drink re-fills. Certainly wanting to find the nearest TGI restaurant near me and visit soon.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,I'm in Cyprus with the UN and have been stuck in camp for 3 weeks with rubbish food. I went to TGI Friday's today and had the most amazing food ever!! The JD burger is immense!,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,It was what I expect of TGI'S. I like the menu as for me it has alot on it I like. No problems experienced and I enjoyed the food and the cocktail.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Nice offers, usual atmosphere you would expect in the specific branch. Love the salads, maybe it's the fresh ingredients from Cyprus that make the difference.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"We went there on the 15/August holiday that all other places were closed for lunch. Very much family friendly with lots of kids around. The food quality has been steadily deteriorating at this establishment; one can see the tangible difference between the dining experience when it first opened and now days' one. The salads are less and less appetizing, the sides are deep fried in stale oil and the steaks are never served in the ordered doneness. As far as doneness is concerned, in Cyprus the standard is for the waiter to be asking merely for statistical reasons as –in almost all occasions- the steak comes out at whatever state the chef decided for you; I would have expected an American franchise diner to succeed in this, though. I would recommend only if all other dining choices are unavailable.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Its overall an average American restaurant as you can find better american restaurants in the town offering a bit more than the average.The food is ok but the desserts are wonderful!!The service sometimes is a bit slow.Recommended for going out with friends or family.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,Last time I went to Nicosia T.G.I Friday's was last March when I went with my colleagues for lunch. One of my colleagues orderered a salad and when he started eating his salad he found a bug . When the waitress came he ordered spare ribs. Although he had no time to eat the spare ribs he was charged the full amount of the spare ribs. I will never go to T.G.I. Friday's NOT even for a beer and I will always persuade my friends not to go again. T.G.I Not the only Restaurant in Nicosia- Thanks God It's NOT the ONLY Restaurant in Nicosia.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"In my opinion, a place like TGI Fridays will never be excellent. Its generic food will never provide the great culinary experience. However, sometimes I value the predictability and eat there nonetheless. The Nicosia Fridays I'd say exceeds most of its sister restaurants. The food was good, the service was decent, the price mid-level and the opening hours a lot more flexible than those of the rest of the city...",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"Good ambiance , nice food! I have visited TGI in other countries also but I have to say that in Cyprus the Nicosia and Limassol ones are way better ! Love the starters there! Easy parking next to the restaurant is always a plus! Nice place overall .",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,The best of the best!! A place you should GO!! delicious food Excelent service everytime!! I could recoment this for ever! Dont miss it! it worths all the money :) Especialy the one in Limasol with the sea view when seating outside. Great experience everytime! wish i could eat there everyday :),TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"As the title of my revie implies, this restaurant - as well as the ""brother"" restaurant at the Mall of Cyprus - is a BIG disappointment. Every time I go is worst than the previous one from all aspects, service, atmosphere but on top of everything, the food quality. It is getting worst and worst. The quality doesn't justify the relatively high prices. For example, I don't see a reason why I should pay above 20€ for a steak which was supposed to be a Black Angus one, I couldn't chew on it and it was not cooked as per my request (asked for medium-rare, got a medium-well!!!) ... When I pointed out this to the waitress and the floor manager all I got was a ""sorry sir"" and a complimentary bottle of water!!! (Mall of Cyprus). The kids menu has changed as well ... The chicken fingers (one of the most successful plates) has changed to something that I am quite sure most of the kids will ""hate"" (no fries!!! give me a break!!!)In any case, I will try to avoid it in the future.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"i usually go during lunch time and not a lot of people are there. during weekends tho is full and you need a reservation. i used to get the cajun salad there but my new favorites are the burgers there.the food is a little bit overpriced, compared to other restaurants but nonetheless nice food served.also, there is a parking place next to it so is extremely convenient to have lunch there and then go for a walk down town.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre

10,"We went specifically for my daughter's birthday because our experience from TGI Fridays in England is that they make a fuss, sing Happy Birthday and bring a cake. They didn't sing, they didn't bring cake and they didn't even have any to buy. All we had was miserable people! It wasn't the first time we were disappointed but to see my daughter's face on her birthday after we promised her cake and singing and fun, never again. I told the manager and he just shrug his shoulders... Not a happy friday...",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,IS very good restaurant with the only bad thing the price.Is overpriced.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,Part of the International chain serving burgers and other US inspired dishes. Service is OK but prices bite. €4.60 for a Stella or a half liter of local KEO. Food is OK and they have some lunch special offers worth considering.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"I really love the food here, well cooked and well served. in TGI is always Friday!! :)",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,I went there several times. Tasty food but overpriced.,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"We, 2 persons, visited the place late in the evening (after the theatre).The service was prompt but the quality of the food was very, very, poor. My wife refused to eat more than a couple of bites.To the credit of the staff and management, THEY DID NOT CHARGE ANYTHING because when asked why she did not eat her meal, she commented that it wasn't good/tasty/etc.They called the person in charge who said that they were not going to charge us for it and they did not !",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"I love this restaurant with its international cuisine. I dont think I have tried anything on the menu that is not excellent. i especially enjoy the chicken fingers, the Jack Daniels Chicken Strips, the Chicken Ceasar Salad and the Chocolate Malted Turtle for dessert.However, over the last few years I have found that the portions have decreased and the prices have increased.Reservations are needed over the weekend.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"The usual American style diner. Grilling steak at your ordered done-ness is not one of the chef's strong competencies, but the staff willingness to redo is a big plus.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"Visited on a Tuesday for lunch and the place was pretty busy. We were seated immediately and given the menu. Good food and drink selection. However, none of the staff that served us spoke Greek as they should have (after all that's the mother tongue of most people in Cyprus), and hard as we tried we could not get their attention easily. It took quite a while to get served and the food was pretty average.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"The environment and selections are standard for good American chain (franchise) restaurants like Fridays, but the prices are higher than their American counterparts....no surprise about that.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"I love their recipes . The food is almost always of the same great taste and quality. waiters are always happy and helpful . the concept of decoration is mood uplifting and the prices are reasonable. recently renovated and a new ""smoking area"" was erected.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,The food is really stuck in the 80's. Deep fried everything from deep fried cheese macaroni balls to potatoe skins. Extremely expensive unhealthy and processed food that was packaged 9 months ago in Ohio on your plate within 10 mins in Nicosia. Never again...,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"In general I'm quite satisfied with their food. Almost all the times the food is up to the standard, tasty, warm and pleasant.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"One of my favorite restaurant in Cyprus and overseas. Lots of starters and juicy salards, big fat burgers and delicious steaks and pasta, Friday's has it ALL!Better on a week day which will usually have a 20% off discount with selected cards.Last time I visited we celebrated my birthday and after having our enourmous dinner, all the staff of Fridays came with the cake to sing for my the Happy Birthday, the TGI Fridays way.There is also kids playground at most restaurants in Cyprus, both Fridays in Nicosia and both Fridays in Limassol.A mast!I also enjoy Fridays when I am overseas to check the local dish variety.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,"its ok! you won't get hungry. Amex offers, too...it's what you expect although I've had better from other Friday's..",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
30,fridays used to be my favourite place.. a couple of years ago their food changed. they offer less food and the food is not the same like before..,TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"If you are a foreigner and you just want to eat nice fresh well prepared food in Cyprus, this is the perfect place. Theyhave pasta, meat, poultry, nice cocktails, delicious salads... perfect for vegetariand as well... A bit expensive, but very good place!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
40,"I like their food. Prices are high, but they give discount to Laiki cardholders. Thus we had our dinner with drinks for abt 35 EUR. I think that's good price for 2 persons.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
50,"Great food great service, try the Jack Daniels sampler it's excellent!",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,"The food was very dry and not tasty at all !very disappointing !besides very expensive for what we ate ,will not go there again !",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
10,"This is the worst Fridays I've been to. The food is standard, we had the baby back ribs, and that was as everywhere else.The service however was awful! The lady in charge of seating didn't like that we hadn't reserved so she refused to give us an outside table. They were all reserved she claimed and put us next to the kitchen even though there were only 2 occupied tables inside. Outside there were 15 free tables when we arrived and 14 free when we left an hour later. Complaining to the manager didn't help as he was to busy drooling over the reservation chick. We never got their 2 for 1 cocktail offer either as that seemed to be reserved for the local Greek speakers. Nobody followed us up to ask if we wanted another drink so we left as quickly as we could.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
20,"The quality of the food is not what you expect for it's history. Meat is the main thing you want to eat when you go to such places but this doesn't mean that the chef should care less for all the other dishes of the menu.Don't try salmon or swordfish. They are crop. Not to mention the poor quality of the vegetables that accompany these dishes.Chicken nuggets boiled in dirty and many times cooked oil.They should care more for the dishes they offer. Having a good name or being in a very good position in the city, doesn't make you a good restaurant. You must preserve your good name and try hard to offer good quality food.",TGI Fridays - Nicosia City Centre
