50,I cannot fault this place since all plates are excellent. Many thanks again and again. I will definitely recommend them and will most certainly go back.,Valtou Rigani
50,"I visited Vatlou Rigani last week for a post-conference informal dinner. This restaurant was highly recommended and did not disappoint. On the night, despite the restaurant being completely booked out, the staff were extremely attentive and welcoming to our large group. A special mention to our waiter, Bianca, for being so great and the Manager, Marios for making it a stress-free evening.We had an array of dishes, with many of my colleagues commenting on how delicious they were. The feta covered in filo pasty and honey was a crowd favourite. It was a first visit to Cyprus for many of the dinner guests and I felt that this was the perfect restaurant to introduce them to traditional Cypriot food in a relaxed environment after a busy day.",Valtou Rigani
20,"Overall the food is nice, service was great,i've visited the place many times but,my last experience wasn't as pleasant as i found a massive long hair tangled up in my food.There was nothing complimentary offered by the restaurant which we found poor of them not to do,considering I did not finish my lunch after the insident.",Valtou Rigani
50,"My biggest problem was that i did not know what to order...as everything was simply appetizing and promising!So, i went for 1 fig salad with manouri cheese, 1 wrapped fetta with drilled honey on top, 2 chicken mpifteki and 1 soutzoukakia (dish of the day).Every single thing was delicious and freshly made!My favorite (hard to chose from all these goodies) was the soutzoukakia (beef kiofte in tomatoe sauce and cumin served with pilau rice).We paid EUR 22 (incl water)?!!! Cannot believe it! Definitely going back again...sooner than soon!",Valtou Rigani
40,Very nice food. Well cooked and you are served dishes you did not try before. Decent pricing and great quality. Also lovely staff and atmosphere.,Valtou Rigani
50,"The food is amazing, the stuff is friendly. You should visit this small restaurant in Larnaca. Visit it and enjoy! :)",Valtou Rigani
50,Perfect for an urban night out meze with great variety. The meat was perfectly cooked and the salads and dips were great as well. Also very cheap taking into account the great variety,Valtou Rigani
50,"Me and my husband have visited many times and the quality of food and service is consistent. Love the Apple, Carrot and Cabbage salad, Halloumi with Pomegranate and sauce, Chicken liver....Food is always very nicely cooked and presented, staff very polite, friendly and helpful, value for money.",Valtou Rigani
50,"Really really pleased we found this restaurant which is sort of tucked away and suffered from current roadworks outside at the moment. It’s traditional Greek cuisine in an atmospheric environment and lots of nice touches and although it was empty when we arrived in a Tuesday night it started to fill as the evening progressed.We order a platter and some sides and the food came well presented, delicious in and on fun crockery. Really liked the place and good service and nice music being played. Definitely recommended.",Valtou Rigani
40,I quite liked the layout and the design of Valtou Rigani. It really puts you in an appetizing mood. The food is quite good and the service is very fast. Prices are reasonable. Overall very good.,Valtou Rigani
30,"Good Greek food, friendly staff ready to help you. We did not like the way you order, Good but not something very special",Valtou Rigani
40,"We went on a weekday afternoon. The place is nicely decorated, and the service is very attentive. Food is good; they ingredients they used are of fine quality. Had kebab with yogurt sauce which was nice.",Valtou Rigani
10,Intimidating to customer Never had such a bad eating experience. The food was so bad i could not believe it. Had lamb chops the worst ever. Kebab definitely frozen and the worst of a kind literally dog food and so the pork souvlaki.,Valtou Rigani
50,"The service is great, fast, tasty always With a smile. Very good prices. Lemonate With ginger is reccomented. Inspiring place. The food is served in traditional full of history plates. The personel makes you feel like home. Just in love With it",Valtou Rigani
40,Small restaurant Tasty kitchen mostly greek plates. Everything was tasty and fresh. You may order sticks of kebab and small dishes of what ever you like. The prices are moderate and quality very good indeed. We will go again,Valtou Rigani
40,Pretty good food. Very good value for money. Nice service. Totally recommended for a quick tasty bite.,Valtou Rigani
40,Went early in the afternoon for a few after work bites. Tried the salad and a few skewers of chicken and pork and two chicken patties. Everything was fresh and cooked really well. I'd advise to make a reservation beforehand because even on Mondays it's full!,Valtou Rigani
40,Great Greek menu and food. Nice place to go with friends to share lots of different tasty dishes. Quick and good service.,Valtou Rigani
50,"Quirky, modern, amazing food, good menu, reasonable prices. What else do you want?I had the sharing platter which was 2 pork, 2 chicken skewers, mushroom skewers, home made lamb and chicken burgers, halloumi, fries, Pitta bread and dips, around £16/€18? The staff looked a bit grumpy and weren’t at all friendly or talkative but they did there job.. I guess we are used to nicey nicey English hovering over us the whole meal to clean the tables. Literally loved this place, quite hard to find as it is called something different when translated (see pics it begins with B) and isn’t advertised outside the place. It’s next to an Indian furniture shop on the corner and the external is black.",Valtou Rigani
50,"The Mrs and I left Paphos at around 11AM and headed to Nicosia with very little in the way of plans. When we arrived, I hit up Tripadvisor for where to go and to our luck Valtou Rigani was nearby.I have nothing negative to say. It’s a fantastic find, plenty to look at and lots to take in for such a small restaurant. The staff are friendly, not overly attentive as to interrupt your meal but with a gentle gesture they are at your side in a heartbeat. That’s my kind of service!The food was excellent, we had the sharing platter for two and everything was delicious. I HATE mushrooms with a passion but even tried them here and the taste was delicious. The hummus was exceptional it’s honestly the best I’ve ever had and the spicy Feta dip was divine.I wish we had known about this place before as I’d make the 2hr drive daily just to get my fix!Definitely a must visit stop if you’re anywhere nearby!!!",Valtou Rigani
50,"I've spent more than five months in Cyprus and the Greek food at Valtou Rigani is just about the best--particularly if you like grilled meat, innovative salads, and traditional dips with hummus. The portion size and the prices are both very reasonable. The service is friendly without being hovering. And the molten chocolate cake with ice cream is UNFORGETTABLE! (There are limited choices for vegetarians and no fish--but all the non-meat options are outstanding.) It's located on a quiet side street but near the old walled city. We ate outside under an awning, which was retracted near sunset.",Valtou Rigani
40,"Had dinner here--grilled meat is by the stick, so had a pork souvlaki, chicken souvlaki, seftalia, kebab, and a Greek village sausage, along with some fries, pita bread, beer, and some zivania to go along with a cigar. It was only 20.80 Euro total, which seemed like a pretty decent deal.",Valtou Rigani
40,"Visited for dinner on two consecutive days.The first day we sampled a few things and felt better prepared for the second visit.During the second visit I enquired as to a seftalia counts as one of the otential souvlaki in the mixed platter for two. I was advised that although it comes on a stick, it is not considered so, and if I wanted I could always buy the platter, and buy seftalia on top of that.I appreciate that staff do not have to make life easy, but:(i) we are one of only two tables, as we eat early..no rush in the kitchen then.(ii) we visited back to back evenings and as such we felt we should be expecting a smile and the odd menu flexibility. But, it is not compulsory.That aside all food was tasty, the seftalia being excellent. Salads, dips etc were all great.Not too keen on the ginger lemonade, but it was worth a try.The desserts we brilliant, especially the kataifi...Worth a visit, but feels like it could be better...",Valtou Rigani
30,"Visited this restaurant a few days ago, the food was mediocre at best, especially the chicken kebab. The price relatively to the size of the portion was good. One of the staff was very rude, told us that we should read the menu better before ordering. She also forgot to bring a few drinks that we ordered.",Valtou Rigani
50,"It is a very nice place in the middle of teh center of Nicosia! A perfect place to have your lunch or a dinner. Prices are very affordable, the food is very delicious and teh staff is very polite. Meat-lovers will definitely admire this place! Try their dip selection with Greek pitta bread and their Village salad- best ones in Nicosia!",Valtou Rigani
40,Located near makarios street. The Souvlaki chicken and pork were tender and soft. Tasty potatoes. I did not like so much the fried zucchini . The service was just ok sometimes slow. In general it’s correct ...!,Valtou Rigani
40,"Very tasty food, friendly staff, fast service and a great ambiance. Wonderful decoration, beautiful details on plates and all in all a great value for money!",Valtou Rigani
50,Excellent service and great food! I was there with guests from the US and really loved the various plates..,Valtou Rigani
40,"very good choice if you are a meat lover. good choice of salads. Friendly and quick service. Try the desert, especially kataifi with cream. very modern renovated restaurant.",Valtou Rigani
50,"Amazing small dishes and amazing tastes. Either with friends, family or couples every time the experience is the best. Friendly staff and quick service! You should definetelly try the Aloifes (started plate with pitta bread) and the zuchhini balls (kolokythokeftedes)!",Valtou Rigani
50,We really enjoyed the food. I recommend. Moderately priced and quiet place. The dessert was fantastic (the yellow one in the glass jar...sorry I forget the name).,Valtou Rigani
50,I came early so it was quiet. It gets very busy later. Not surprising. Pleasant service. Good decor. Absolutely lovely food. I ate far more than I really should but life is short. Kebabs were my highlight. Saganaki a close second. Would have liked the red barrel wine to be warmer.,Valtou Rigani
50,Our first visit to this taverna/restaurant was very interesting. The variety of greek meze was very good and the service and staff interest to high standards.,Valtou Rigani
50,"A symphony of amazing tastes!The dips, the starters, the mains the desserts! All perfect! A must visit when in the city of Nicosia! Make sure you try the feta cheese in Fylo served with honey and sesame, the kebabs and the pork burgers. “ekmek kataifaki” and chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was amazing.On top, a great atmosphere and the staff exceptionally friendly and attentive to their customers. Great value for money too! €80 (including tip) for a feast dinner and drinks for 4 persons! Will definitely be back!",Valtou Rigani
50,"Small portions let you try a bit of everything! Fantastic combination of service, food and pricing! It has become our favorite to go place!",Valtou Rigani
40,"Nice restaurant for grilled meats. Casual dining. Good and tasty food, quick service, clean place and toilets and good price. What else can you ask for?",Valtou Rigani
40,"The place was empty when we got there, we were seated in the middle where the waiters kept passing by. We kindly asked if we could be relocated in a corner and the waiter was overfriendly asking us constantly if we want any of the empty plates with us on the new table. We kept saying no thank you but he wouldn’t drop it.The food was tasty, the fries quite salty and the pork souvlaki very chewy.The place was filled up pretty soon.Nice place but definitely not great.",Valtou Rigani
40,"This place has been recommended to me on many occassions, and we finally found the time to go with the family. The closed to it is Piatsa Gouronalki - however you dont have to get stuck looking for parking down Ledra street!. The staff super friendly and helpful. The place decorated as appropriate. The food: all was great, only the pork souvlaki could have been better. Prices were very good. Must visit again.",Valtou Rigani
50,"In Nicosia on a business trip so went to this restaurant near our hotel. Best decision we could have made. We had no booking but they managed to accommodate my colleague and I. It was filling up with locals which I think is always a good sign! Menu supplied in English for us tourists and was clear and accurate. We ordered the dip platter, and grill platter, plus some starters and side salads. All came really quickly, and were of a high quality. Even the basics like the pitta bread tasted really good, but the skewers and dips were the highlight for me. Reasonably priced too, and we were perhaps a bit ""o'erfaced"" as there was plenty left when we were done. I'm no expert on Cypriot cuisine but this seemed to be a genuine and tasty selection of local delights. Friendly and helpful waiting staff too! Highly recommended.",Valtou Rigani
40,"This is a trendy, very popular casual eatery specializing in Greek food with a twist! Dishes well prepared and presented and very tasty although some dishes are very much better than others. Excellent salads and desserts! Very good friendly and efficient service. Better book beforehand as it gets very busy later in the evening.",Valtou Rigani
50,"excellent Greek meze food.highly recommended.very tasty food.nice atmosphere,friendly staff, express service",Valtou Rigani
40,"We found myself hungry at downtown Nicosia at 14:15 having arranged a meeting for 15:30. Any other place to eat at a radius of 5 minutes drive was closed, so we selected the Valtou Rigani, which was proved as an excellent selection. Γood food and very good prices. The extra good thing is that they are offering different kinds of ""souvlaki"" by piece, hence you are able to taste as many kinds as your stomach can afford.",Valtou Rigani
50,"We tried this restaurant as we had eaten in Piatsu the night before (rightfully number 1 on here by the way) so of course we wanted to eat somewhere else the following night. We were staying at the Cleoptra Hotel which is at the bottom end of the street from this place. On the night we were walking home from Piatsu, we passed this place at about 10pm and it was full, so we thought we'd give it a go the following night, so booked a table (seemed like a good idea as people who arrived on the night that had not booked seemed to get moved to the tables further away and not as good as the booked ones). We found the food to be almost as good as Piatsu and once again plentiful. We had the platter for 2 and there was more than enough food. Wine was cheap too. Overall it was less than 30euros for the platter and 2 caraffes of wine! You'd sepnd that in a chain pub in England for an average meal. If you are in that area, give it a go. The food is the same as Piatsu, so we thought was it silly to do similar again the following night but then thought not as when we got back home we would miss that food as no matter what you think you can create at home...its never quite the same.",Valtou Rigani
30,"We did not enjoy our meal at this place. Although the starters were tasty, the main dishes (souvlaki and other meat) were badly cooked. The restaurant itself has nice settings.",Valtou Rigani
50,We love this restaurant in Nicosia and we are never disappointed... great food and great service staff are always helpful and the food is always as good as the last time. Variety of salads and great platters ...,Valtou Rigani
50,"The restaurant does Greek food with a Cypriot angle. The souvlaki is more like the Cypriot one, which I prefer and it also has sheftalia which is twice as big. Both souvlaki and sheftalia were excellent. The mpifteki is also one of its highlights and I strongly recommend it. The greek salad is super as well. I rate this restaurant 5* because every single dish i tried was very good and there is a wide variety of dishes to choose from.In terms of price, we got several dishes and 1 beer each amounting €17 p.p. Which is fare. It is a good alternative from a traditional souvlitzi or another greek style tavern.",Valtou Rigani
30,"Service started well but became inattentive as the evening wore on.Taste of things we tried was just OK and the souvlaki was dry and tough.Prices were reasonable but, all in all, it wasn't a particularly satisfying meal.A similar concept, done much more convincingly, are the Piatsa Gourounaki restaurants in central Nicosia.",Valtou Rigani
50,Never heard of this restaurant but was taken by friends. Food great service spot on and great value . Will be back well done guys,Valtou Rigani
50,I went alone at noon they opened just for me and star cooking for me. I tried a lot of different traditional greek meals and everything was very good. Specially feta cheese with crusty honey on top. Very good price and service excellent.,Valtou Rigani
50,Went for dinner and the first thing that strikes you it that it's different from other places. The owners have taken great table to decorate the place.I ordered a selection of dips and was surprised at the selection and even told the staff that it was under priced. We also ordered a salad and some kebabs on pita. The food quality was very good.Would definitely go there again many times and recommend others to visit this place.,Valtou Rigani
40,Nice and friendly atmosphere. Everything we ordered was freshly cooked and delicious. Great prices as well! I will definitely go back!,Valtou Rigani
10,Not good with keeping their orders correct and in time. Ordered extra stuff to three different waiters but after half an hour they came saying that by mistake the order did not go through and they will process it then. Meanwhile everyone was done eating...,Valtou Rigani
40,"I went with my wife and 11 year daughter. The food was on time, very nice and the service quite good. Should go for a quite evening again",Valtou Rigani
40,"A friend of ours insisted that this is a very nice ""new"" place for souvlacki so we decided to visit it. The environment is OK, within a quiet neighbourhood. The food was overall good, the souvlacki was nice chicken and pork, not perfect (8/10), but it was small for its price. All salad choices we ordered were very good.",Valtou Rigani
50,"The place has a very relaxing decor but still remains modern. The service was excellent with smiling waiters ready to serve you or explain you any food from the catalogue. The food is amazing as well as the desert, everything freshly cooked. The prices are very good as well",Valtou Rigani
40,"Original decorated near Makarios street Nicosia. Nice sitting place surrounded by small trees, waiters are very nice and friendly. Simple menu with no huge variety of dishes mainly they serve souvlaki (chicken,pork etc), salads, dips, potatoes and 3 sort of desert. By the way, it's very easy to chose quickly what you want to eat...and you feel happy!",Valtou Rigani
40,"This restaurant is good for what it purports to be. A no-frills greek-food restaurant near the shopping streets of Makariou and Stasikratous, with fair prices, delicious food and music louder than necessary. In fact, I really liked the feta wrapped in fyllo dough and honey, the choices of kebab and chicken souvlaki were consistently well cooked, the fries were crispy and the dips well spiced! The only pet peeves I have is that they bring the pita bread in the beginning, and it goes cold by the time the meat comes, the music is a bit too loud for conversation, and the tables are too close to each other to breath/converse. It's a small place, so that might be expected. I would return, and believe this restaurant is here to stay.",Valtou Rigani
50,"As a family we were taken here by a family member who lives in Nicosia. We had heard of Valtou Rigani and had passed by the restaurant in Larnaca and loved how different it looked but as we knew we were being taken to the Nicosia restaurant we waited to try it here. I am actually writing this review as we sit and recover from the amazing feast we've just eaten. The restaurant is on a quiet road and there is plenty of parking. We sat on the outside decking and our host ordered for us. We started with a selection of Greek dips including a beetroot yoghurt and a basil flavoured dip as well as tzanziki and houmous. Valtou Rigani offers a taste of Greece in Cyprus (their are differences in Greek food/cooking compared to Cypriot). The feta cheese wrapped in filo with honey mastic dressing was sublime as was the rocket salad with sun dried figs and Manouri cheese. We had a selection of the chicken and pork souvlaki, homemade chicken burgers (delicious) and bacon pancetta. Prices range from 1.20 for dips to 6.5 for the rocket salad and 1.80 for a skewer of chicken souvlaki. One of the staff mentions that all food is freshly prepared and lunchtime specials also include one vegetarian dish such as butter beans with fresh greens. The restaurant offers the opportunity to pick small dishes (rather like a tapas) of food to share. As there were a few of us we ordered all the deserts. I particularly liked the kateifi with cream in a jar. OMG amazingly delicious. There are only two restaurants in Cyprus. Friendly waiters, quick service.",Valtou Rigani
50,"The food was excellent, the staff was very polite. The desert was devine. One of the the best choices for good food in a beautiful environment, in Nicosia.",Valtou Rigani
40,"I have been there 3-4 times. The food is very good and the prices are reasonable. It is a small, cozy & clean place with relaxed atmosphere.",Valtou Rigani
30,"I have to say that I was not thrilled and that I expected something much better, especially after having read the reviews on tripadvisor. The food was ok, We had salad, kebab, french fries, dips and potato salad ... good quality, but nothing special. The price was ok - not too expensive.However, the service left much to be desired. Four waiters who preferred talking to each other instead of paying attention to the clients and seeing if they want to order something. So, it took AGES until a waiter passed by so that I could order another bottle of water. Same story, and even worse, as to the bill. First you have to wait an eternity until a waiter passes by so that you can ask for the bill, and then the bill doesn't come and we have to ask for the bill a second time. Apparently it was so interesting for them to hear what the other waiters had to tell that they completely forgot to bring the bill. So my conclusion is - as you can see in the title. Food and price ok, however, the service could be much better.",Valtou Rigani
50,"Very good and clean, modern restaurant with greek and turkish food. We were here during lunch time and will come back many times during our stay. Price are very friendly also.",Valtou Rigani
50,We went there last Friday night. We had to reserve. The food was very good (except the grilled pitta with rigani which was very hard to chew and cold as well). Good draught beer. Price was quite reasonable.,Valtou Rigani
40,Visited this place on a hot summer evening. We didn't have a reservation but they accommodated us. The food was plentiful and tasty and the service was pretty good. A really good option if you are in the area.,Valtou Rigani
40,"Nice atmosphere, good food and excellent service!!!! Menu could be a bit bigger but overall its a cute place for a casual night out ! Would visit again! :)",Valtou Rigani
50,"Fine produce, made at the place and not ready made. Unique quality. Everything fresh. Well done ! Would only be good if a coffee was offered on the house, if not desert, as common practice.",Valtou Rigani
50,The most enjoyable relaxed lunch. Meze style from an marvellous local menu. Pick and choose as you like. Small wine list but good wine at reasonable prices. Service was first class. Come early or book in advance - you must try this,Valtou Rigani
40,"The ambience of the place is cosy and inviting for a lovely dinner. The food is delicious. I loved the potato salad with caper, the feta wrapped in phyllo dough with honey and the homemade burger and courgettes fritters to name a few. I was not much impressed by the souvlaki as I have tried a lot better elsewhere. It was good but not up to the level of the rest dishes. The top of all is the dessert! I had the chocolate dessert with toasted peanuts that is purely divine. So make sure you leave a bit of space for the sweet treat in the end! I want to go back to try more of the dishes. Definitely a place to recommend!",Valtou Rigani
40,"Visited the place with friends, it was a nice experience tasting room greek food. The food was nice cooked and served quickly. Definitely we will visit it again.",Valtou Rigani
40,Excellent small and cozy place to enjoy food at reasonable prices. Souvlaki is perfect!!!!Service is excellent and decoration is fantastic. Definetely worth a visit. Make sure you will reserve a place.,Valtou Rigani
20,"First time and definitely the last. Valtou Rigani caught my attention because of a flattering review in Cyprus Mail, but it was a bias review. Actually this is another fast food restaurant with salads, dips (3 are homemade), grilled meat. No soups and no fresh juice. And you pay even for the pita!!!If no soup, I opted for Rocket salad with figs and Manouri cheese, €6.50. A lot of rocket, but only one fig cut in strips, one tomato, white cheese and some pieces of fried pita (arab style, like in fattoush), all topped with a sweetened balsamic vinegar (?) to make up for the scarcity of figs. Hummus dip: average taste and very cold (they keep it in the fridge already portioned, so even the jar is freezing cold!) and came in small quantity - 2 leveled teaspoons. But, at least, pita was hot. If you like souvlaki this is your place (€ 1,50-1,70/kalamaki/skewer), probably value for money.Only the waiter is worth of praising, he was fast, polite and present for the three tables with diners outside on the terrace.Nonetheless, one review here has in a few short sentences words like: amazing, wow, all perfect, excellently, fantastic, gem. I wonder!",Valtou Rigani
40,"Very nice restaurant and when compared to price - Value for money. Good food and quiet, relaxing atmosphere",Valtou Rigani
50,"Very nice place, with very nice food and very good service! We will come back! ;-) All their souvlaki pork and chicken and their kolokythokeftedes and the dips were delicious!",Valtou Rigani
50,Simply excellent. The attention to detail is evident in everything; from food quality to decoration. Definitely worth a visit,Valtou Rigani
50,We booked this restaurant for a group family visit. We were all impressed from the moment we walked in! I loved the vibe and finishing touches from old shutters on the ceiling to the mix matched plates on the table. Moving on to the important bit... The food! It really was impressive as we were a large group we were able to sample most of the dishes on the menu. We really enjoyed the salad of the day with apples and feta with honey! The meats were succulent and had great flavour. We were all stuffed but we managed room for sharing some desserts. So pleased we did both were divine. The service was great and plates cleared and food kept flowing. A great gem of restaurant...Nicosia is lucky to have it we could only wish they had a sister restaurant in London... Keep us posted if you do!,Valtou Rigani
20,"This restaurant posts photographs where the dishes are not available, very few are and ONLY for lunch! Rude staff and meat not tender enough! Yet another disappointment in Nicosia.",Valtou Rigani
50,"Stumbled across this amazing restaurant whilst on holiday in Nicosia. I simply can't fault the restaurant.The souvlaki is amazing, the deserts to die for! The service was impeccable, you really can't go wrong with this place. We've visited it a few times and have told family back home when coming to Cyprus this place is a must!",Valtou Rigani
50,"I visited this restaurant in August for a family meal. All I can say is wow. The food,service and ambience were all perfect. The dishes are all excellently presented and the taste fantastic. If in Nicosia please give this gem of a restaurant a try. Well done guys and thank you.",Valtou Rigani
50,Just Visit it. Great atmosphere and whole design of the shop is great. Food is fresh and tasty. Easily the best Souvlaki in Nicosia. Great salads and dips.,Valtou Rigani
50,it was a big surprise the service was fast and the food simply perfect i suggest it i think its the most accessible restaurant with good taste of style and awesome flavors the prices was low and the Mario was there with a big smile from satisfaction and happiness thank you very much for your service so then VALTOU RIGANI !!!! :p,Valtou Rigani
50,"Food is fantastic! Great service, tasty Cypriot/ Greek food but with a twist and a personal touch. Definetley worth visiting!!",Valtou Rigani
50,"Delicious food, the grills and the little different dips plates made my day. It was very good value for money as well. The salad with the dried figs and the ruccola in it is also very good.",Valtou Rigani
50,"Valuable delicious Cypriot cuisine , you can taste the fresh products they use. They serve the meze in a modern way , you can determine the amount of food itself.delicious beers and coffee . We eat lunch and enjoyed a delicious moussaka.we 'll be back.",Valtou Rigani
50,"There are scented orange blossoms outside so walking into this Greek (not cypriot) souvlaki bar was such an absolute pleasure. And the inside didn't disappoint either, retro chairs and tableware and an outside space (for smokers sadly). The food is simple, well priced and quite yummy too. A skewer of chicken souvlaki (with 4-5 pieces of cut breast) is €1.70. Order as many as you want-it comes by itself-bread is additional. The rocket salad with dried figs is a must. I'd go again if I could.",Valtou Rigani
50,"I choose this restaurant between many other similar in Nicosia and i was not dissapointed.We had the dish of the day Fakes which was very good and also the chicken in the oven which was also very tasty! Greek salad was nice and last the ekmek kataifi dessert was amazing! Service was ok but not bad. The prices are very reasonable and its something people look in our days. Last the only negative wine by the glass was not in the best quality as it was little oxidized but i didnt mention it to the waiter to be honest. i would for sure visit again, well done!",Valtou Rigani
50,"A small and cosy place, ideal for a casual night out. The waiters and speed of service were excellent. We almost tried everything from the menu and everything ranked high in our expectations. As for the interior of the restaurant, it was warm and welcoming and we felt very comfortable. A nice place for couples and families.",Valtou Rigani
40,Went with friends and decided to try a variety of things. All were very tasty and we enjoyed them all! Try the red wine of the place... very good!,Valtou Rigani
40,"Heard about this place from a friend and decided to check it out and we were pleasantly surprised. Neat, cozy and friendly.The menu is not extensive (doesn't always have to be), but what is on there looks great, everything is freshly made and their pork chops......!!! You read Juicy on the menu and think, yeah yeah, they always say that. Well, they are REALLY juicy...all 500grams. Highly recommended.The pricing is really good too. €25 for two people for lunch and satisfied.Staf is friendly, kitchen is open, interior is welcoming, a nice big outside seating area as well.Definitely a place for a good lunch and dinner. Just try it and let yourself be pleasantly surprised.",Valtou Rigani
40,It was my first visit to Valtou Rigani but I must say very enjoyable. A limited menu but it has everything you need for lunch or a night out with good friends. priced very reasonable with a nice decor and atmosphere. Highly reccomended,Valtou Rigani
40,"A very cosy place to have dinner. Helpful staff. A very well prepared menu, just one page. Salads fresh served with pitta and the dishes freshly prepared.",Valtou Rigani
