50,"We went to Louis tavern for our Tsiknopempti dinner, we were greeted with a warm welcome and a lovingly decorated hall with a fireplace. We were seated comfortably and ordered the meze for three. The portions were, in my opinion, just perfect, since we enjoyed the starters along with a very surprising artichoke dish, the meat dishes were very well prepared, the food was brought to us at a good pace and given the fact that it Tsiknopempti is one of the busiest nights of the year we had a great experience. Thank you Mr Louis and staff for your great service!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,I have not ate this good in a long time. Wide variety of vegetarian options and great service. All together a succesfull evening. I will definately visit again.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Went last night for the first time after it was recommended a couple of times. The location might not be the best, but the food certainly is! We ordered Mezze, it was just amazing. All dishes were spiced well and cooked to perfection, it was a good selection and also different from the usual standard you get anywhere else. Meats were soft and juicy (which is not often the case with mezze dishes) and the portions just right for the two of us so we could actually try everything and didn’t walk out feeling sick of overeating (also no waste, which I personally like). Owners are really friendly and make you feel very welcome! I will definitely be back and can highly recommend!!!!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"We went to Louis with a group a friends. The food is really nice and has a good variety of meat based / meze dishes. Good atmosphere and good service.Not the mainstream cyprus tavern with the endless amount of dishes but our experience both foodwise and in terms of service and hospitality was very goodPricing is ok, not expensive.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"My husband and I visited this restaurant after reading excellent reviews on trip advisor. On arrival we were escorted to the outdoor garden. We were given complimentary meze and had the most amazing pork chop. Louis was always ensuring that we had everything we needed and even gave us a complimentary kio beer, strawberries and pastry desert. We had an amazing experience and felt shocked at how reasonable the price was after having a HUGE meal. We will definitely return to this place again. An absolute must for everyone.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We had a business lunch at Louis tavern, Mr. Louis is a great professional and mostly he loves what he does !!! Highly Recommended.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,This restaurant might not meet the eye I the beginning but as soon as the meze plates start come you are glad you have chosen to spend your sat evening there. That's what j felt. Logical prices and all tasty food. Strongly recommended,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
20,"We had the meze and while the food itself was quite tasty, the portions were tiny! This is highly unusual for a Cypriot tavern..we left the place feeling hungry.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We found the tavern online and after reading some reviews we decided to visit it for a Sunday family lunch. A small tavern, located on a main street of Pallouriotissa. We were greeted at the door by the owner with a smile. Really small place, 7-8 tables. We chose to have the meze so we tasted everything. The food was amazing. Fresh ingredients, homemade traditional dishes nicely combined in the meze menu. We both enjoyed it and the kids loved it. The owner is a great man, served us with joy and had everything in good order. We are definitely going back soon and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a ""private"" lunch or dinner outing. It's a great place to have a friends night out with a good eating experience, without the annoying disturbances from other tables or service delays etc",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I was craving meze so went with my auntie and uncle. We had the meat meze (18 euros per head) and it was fantastic. We had a few veggie dishes and then pork and chicken souvlaki, lamb chops, pork fillet, sheftalia, keftedes, loukanika, halloumi, chips, Greek salad and much more. It was the right amount for us and we left stuffed and very happy. They also gave us a couple of warm pastries and fresh fruit to end our meal which was a lovely touch. There was only one other table in there on Saturday night which I can’t understand as the quality of the food was fantastic and all cooked beautifully. They are also English Cypriots so speak perfect English. Highly recommended.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"It’s our favorite for family gatherings. The food is great! Every dish is very tasty and the serving pace just right. The host / waiter, Mr Louis is very polite and helpful.Recommended!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We went to Louis tavern last night for family dinner before I head back to the UK and we loved it. Is not the cheapest meze in Nicosia but it certainly is one of the best. Freshly made, tasty food, cute decpr and exceptional service. They accommodated for all our needs including two different salads and non-salty food for my mum.The owner and his son love what they do and that comes across. Worth a visit!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Food can be good in various forms, served in delicate plates, but the best food is made from LOVE.Louis tavern services Love for the art of cooking and love for it's customers.I had an amazing time a the restaurant Louis.A veraity of foods very well prepared with the original local touch.

50,"Excellent food and very welcoming atmosphere! The owners are very kind and are willing to help you. Also, the prices are very affordable.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Amazing food, great service, GENEROUS portions.Seems like a family run restaurant, the food is cooked with care, very fresh and diversifiedThe menu is limited which is a great thing as it gives a guarantee that none of what we have eaten was frozenThe meze for two would have fed an army so do arrive starving as you will not finish the meal.Well recommended :)",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We had heard many great things about Louis tavern, thus we decided to call him on Sunday to see if they were open. We told them that we were 5 people and they literally opened the tavern just for us. And I cannot describe how good the food was. Won't make any spoilers here as to what the mezes include, but you will enjoy every moment of it",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"One of the best meze we've tried. The staff is really nice and funny, everything is freshly made in-house, including the pita. Would recommend it to everyone who visits Nicosia.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Very high quality Cypriot meze in a warm (literally because we sat next to the fireplace!), cozy atmosphere where it is possible to have a conversation without shouting, and also possible to have a rocking good time without disturbing other diners. You will be waited on by the owners and treated like a member of the family. Don't miss it!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Great atmosphere, cozy place with fireplace.The owner is very polite and welcomes everyone with a big smile. The food is delicious.Everything served has great taste.!!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant

Besides that, Louis and his family are great people. Me and my boyfriend always come to Louis’ Tavern for great food and recommend it to everyone, it is definitely our favorite place in Nicosia.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant

50,I keep coming back to this restaurant as it is a quiet place with excellent food and service. The owner is very attentive to the guests and makes sure everyone is well taken care of. I've been a regular customer and the quality has been kept to the same high standards. Definitely worth visiting!!,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"First I would like to state the fact that Louis Tavern been one of the few restaurants that kept me satisfied for the past 10 years.The great atmosphere ( especially during winter) with that amazing central fireplace, the delicious meze including one of my favourite dishes snails with tomatoes sauce and of course Mr Louis himself with his friendly and cool personality are just a few of the highlights of this Splendid Tavern.Living in the UK at the moments does not allow me to visit Louis Tavern regularly but it’s a must every time a visit Cyprus.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Louis Taverna is a quiet, off center restaurant, which serves the best meze dishes in Nicosia. Each dish is well cooked and tasty. The serving pace is just right, providing adequate time to enjoy the food. The owner (who is also chef and waiter) is a very polite and friendly person. A must visit restaurant for everyone who wants to try a quality Cyprus meze dinner.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"Food was delicious. Owner was so friendly. Lovely spot. I had the lamb chops, which were scrumptious. Had a candied orange peel as a desert that was to die for. Only wish they had wifi.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Visited on a rather slow weekday.The food was delivered in a nice slow pace, giving the guests time to eat, talk, socialize. The quality was very good, with a nice selection of all which one would expect from in a typical Cyprus meze. A nice addition the usual suspects was the cooked artichokes and cooked mushrooms (cooked in wine I believe). Fruit and sweet fried pastries were also included in the food selection.Overall good quality/quantity/price ratio.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"A group of friends visiting a number of taverns in Nicosia, trying to find the best one to make it our meeting place. After visiting more than a dozen of taverns it was very clear to us that Louis is by far one of the best taverns if not the best in Nicosia.Keeping the traditional Cyprus meze culture alive and not just serving the typical 50 tasteless plates that every tavern does.Selected plates such as snails in garlic and butter sauce, mushrooms cooked in heaven by St. Peter and keftedes better than my grandmas....I still can't understand the 2 very bad critics for this tavern.Probably their taste buds are damaged...Anyway...Love this tavern and will keep visiting for as long as i can chew...Kalin orexin",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
10,"In all fairness to this establishment, I have to start this review by stating that I HATE CYPRUS MEZE food and this is a place that only serves that. Why did I go? I was invited there. Why do I write this review? To ""protect"" my fellow human beings who are not familiar with this type of food.The definition of Cyprus Meze: Anything and everything that can be served, shall be served. If each plate cannot be combined with the previous or the next one, is of no importance. It is a ""to hell with quality; bring quantity"" approach to food.Now, back to Louis Tavern. I walked in with a friend on a Wednesday evening around 9, waiting for another 2 friends to join us. The place was empty - literally! Not one single soul was sitting there before us. As soon as we walked in, we were asked if we had a reservation (???)! What kind of a question is that? Later in the evening, another table of two was filled.I am not going to give you the full set menu. That would be impossible! However, for example, we had 5 different pork plates (smoked ham, sausage, pork filet, pork ""souvlaki and pork ""sheftalia"", 1 chicken, 1 lamb and they kept bringing more. That was just the meat, which was cooked dry and it had so much salt, my lips went numb. What really upsets me in this type of place is that, if you do not want a plate of food, not putting it on the table is NOT an option. You HAVE to have it!I believe that 18EUR per person was the price of the food (without drinks) but with this quality, I definitely did not feel I was getting any value for money.Finally, I was surprised to see all the great reviews and that this place is highly recommended in Trip Advisor. I am sorry, but I respectfully, yet strongly, disagree!!! If my boss ever invites me to this place, I shall know, he wants to make me quit my job...",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Being a local and tried pretty much every tavern in Nicosia I must say that Louis Tavern is one of my top choices! Great food (Souvlaki, Sheftalia, lamb chops) and also great atmosphere, specially if u visit during the winter time and seat by the fireplace.A must visit place when in Nicosia.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
30,"The food is good and there's a nice variety of meat and side dishes. The downside is that the price of 18 Euros for meze is quite expensive and not at all justified, taking in mind that the dishes served were pretty much standard found in most taverns on the island with less than 15Euros. In general, a bit overrated in my opinion.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"The Louis Taverna & Restaurant is a well known landmark in the capital city of Nicosia. For any who seek to visit the island or local, I fully recommend to enjoy traditional Cyprus cuisine in the most unique place with exellent service, quality and best prices. As about the food, is delicious...I Enjoyed Sunday lunch with my family and surely would love to revisit. The menu was exactly what I had in mind.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,We had dinner there with our family. The food was excellent and the service was really good. Enjoyed a very nice wine as well!,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,We were invited by family to experience good old fashioned Cypriot cooking and hospitality. It seems that Cypriots eat a lot as our plates were very full!! AND really very good indeed! We just ate souvlaki but it was more than filling and very fresh meat.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,We visited Louis Taven on a working day with some friends after we've read all the good reviews online. The place was empty and was nobody else there except us. At first we were worried that something might be wrong and the reviews may have been wrong.Thankfully though once the food started coming we forgot about everything. Given that we were the only ones there we had all the attention we could get. The food came in quickly and it was delicious. Everything was well cooked and of excellent quality. I especially enjoyed the traditionally cooked mashrooms.The ambiance might not have been great but still we had a lovely meal and we left very satisfied. We will surely visit again. Maybe on a weekend when the place is busier.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,We had diner there with friends and everything was excellent. Food was well cooked and excellent quality.The service was very good and the staff friendly and helpful. We order various plates ( meze) and everything was very tasteful.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
30,Collected food ordered over the phone. Ready on time and was very good quality for seven of us. Staff very pleasant but not a great looking venue for eating in.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"We went midweek, mid August. Nobody there except us. I wouldn't say it's the perfect place for a romantic date (we were positioned in what amounted to a driveway, with a view of the road one side and our car the other) but nevertheless it was a lovely meal and we were looked after, even though the cars were swishing by.I have special dietary needs, so the meze was an impossibility, but the owners were very accommodating and cooked us a pork fillet and chicken kebab with a mixed salad and wonderful homemade tahini. Olives and bread too.Our bill came to 29 euro, which was pricey for this, a beer and a bottle of water, and I'm not sure that it was special enough to make the trip back on another occasion, but it was an enjoyable evening nevertheless. Maybe in winter it's better, with more people to jolly along the atmosphere.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,I have been many times to Louis and the consistency on the food quality is always excellent. Friendly service and always with a smile. Highly recommended!,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"As we were in Nicosia for the day and getting hungry we sought out this recommended restaurant.Its a short drive away from the walled city(worth a taxi ride!). On arrival we were very warmly greeted by Linda and then later on by Louis, Linda explained the food available. The food is first class Cypriot fare, and i particularly liked the unusual items on the menu,the snails,The superb Mushrooms in Garlic to mention two. Also excellent wine list. Will certainly return for another meze next time im in Nicosia,thanks for a great meal.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I been living in the area of this restaurant for over 4 years and never knew about it ! Then a friend traveled from a far and was insiting on dining in Louis, describing the food as exceptional. I was skeptical as i live in the area and have never been.The meal was splendid. The flavours brilliant. The portions just right. The service tremendous.The husband waits upon the tables and his wife cooks.Look at my photos.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,Last December just before christmas I had an interesting experience at Louis Tavern. A powercut to the whole neighbourhood meant that we had to eat our meal in the light of candles and a fireplace. Despite not having power the restaurant still delivered a fantastic meal that unlike your average meze place delivered quality and quantity rather than just extreme quantity!To add to the good vibe following several rounds of beer the host gave us a round free.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"Louis Tavern is a tavern without fancy decoration or modern twists. It is what it must be.Very clean, excellent service and above all top quality food. Each dish is made with the best ingredients. The meats are top quality, vegetables are crispy fresh and the recipes are made in the traditional way.If you fancy real Cyprus dishes made of high quality ingredients that taste great then Louis is an excellent choice. If you are lucky you can taste some seasonal dishes that are served as extras from Louis in order to please his customers.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Louis Taverna serves an amazing traditional Cyprus style meze, and the quality of the food is excellent. Great value for 18 euros each.Louis and the serving staff in the restaurant were lovely and the atmosphere with the fire and greek music is amazing.I will definitely be visiting again with family and friends.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We visited Louis Taverna with a 5 others and were treated very well. Louis serves traditional meze style and the food just kept coming. We finally told Louis we had our limit. The quality of the food was very good. I judge food not only by how it is prepared and tastes but also for how it rides. Louis food ""rides"" very well. Although I ate more than I should have I did not have that bloated feeling and slept like a baby. Louis and his wife did everything to make a great night out.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,Traditional cyprus meze tavern with very tasty and delicious food. Very warm and frendly environment. Definetely a place to visit again both wirh family and friends,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I came across Luis Taverna & Restaurant while looking for a typical cypriot food and this was exactly what we were looking for. I was in Nicosia with my parents, who are very pretentious on food, being italian :DWith 18 euros each you get this MASSIVE mezze plate, with literally everything you can possibly think of. The food was so much that we didn't manage to finish it. Every single thing was delicious! The wine Louis suggested was great and the atmosphere is also amazing, with typical music playing. I will definitely come back to Louis taverna very soon and I will recommend it to all my friends! Thank you Louis, will definitely see you soon!Kalispera!xIlaria",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"What makes this restaurant special is that the owners, Louis and Linda, make the meals from scratch and are extremely friendly! The food was absolutely delicious and there was so much of it. The restaurant's decor was very charming, such a great place to relax after a busy day. We really enjoyed getting to know Louis and Linda, they treated us like family. Worth noting that their fried halloumi is exceptional. All the dishes were amazing and Louis was so kind as to call us a taxi when we were done. We want a similar restaurant in Kuwait please!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We enjoyed this tavern a lot from the variety of the mazes that were fresh and tastey. We actually liked our fingers , the service was attentive and with a smile,This is our second time we visit this resturant.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Great place with excellent food,very good service from friendly staff and all at reasonable prices..",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"One of the best mezze places in Cyprus, family owned, excellent and attentive service, in season produce is served. Just tasty, nice atmosphere, popular with locals.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Words are hard to describe this taverna. The quality and quantity of each dish was excellent. The owners take great care in the food selection as well as the timing of when the dishes reach your table. This was the first time my wife had been to Cyprus and her dining experienced was what I was hoping you would discover. Cyprus, history and quality in every bite",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"One of the best places in nicosia to visit in my opinion. I am a regular costumer and believe the quality for years now is remaining consistent. The tavern is on a main road but outdoor sitting was a pleasant experience cause of the trees surrounding the side.Great fresh food, Cosy atmosphere , Good service.Keep the good work!!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"My wife, daughter and I just spent a wonderful evening at Louis Taverna & Restaurant tonight. We happened to be the only guests there when we arrived so we had the most awesome hospitality from the owners, Louis and his wife in their cosy little restaurant! Louis served the food while his wife cooked the meal, and in between dishes we had nice long chats about life in Cyprus and also for us to tell them a little bit about Singapore :)We had their traditional Cypriot meze - about 20 dishes including fresh salad as starters through to delicious watermelons and honey & nut pita for dessert! The food was amazing - very tasty, with a good variety that included chicken, beef, pork, liver, potatoes, vegetables, cheese etc. It was not like the meze we had at a previous restaurant - this one had real home-cooked taste.After dinner we even had time to sit for awhile to chat and also caught a bit of the World Cup match while we waited for our cab to come.All in all it was a great evening- good food, warm hospitality, and very reasonable price! Will certainly come back if we come to Cyprus again! Highly recommended!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant

40,Good Food but not something different from the most taverns in Cyprus. Good price and the end of the night. Service very good like always. Its worth to try it .,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,Very nice food with a very welcoming atmosphere! All food is served fresh and hot ready to eat and enjoy! Its the best i have visited near Nicosia Town. Surely i recommend this tavern to everyone.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"A good variety of local dishes, tasty and also a good variety of wines. Traditional tavern atmosphere, friendly service.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Friendly family taverna serving real Cypriot meze made from fresh, seasonal ingredients. I love to come here when I am in Nicosia.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"The friendly family that runs it may be its best characteristic, followed by the quality of the ""meze"" dishes. The atmosphere, last night, was positively marked by the fireplace that was lit in the middle of the space. Do not expect a luxurious environment, but do expect carefull cooking of authentic Cypriot cuisine and warm service. As for value, once again ""very good"".",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Recently I went to this restaurant with my son to find out for myself what is was like after reading a review in a local Cypriot newspaper, on trip advisor i saw a few negative comments which when i told the owners they did not understand, i have to say it was very enjoyable and will be going again, the meze was excellent and was value for the money paid, I asked more of one selection and it was given with no extra charge, the people were very friendly. A fine place o eat in Nicosia.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I've had many meze in Cyprus having lived here for 20 odd years. This tjme i wanted to try somewhere new and came across Louis' on Trip Advisor. I have to say it's been one of the best meals yet.The tavern is warm and inviting in the winter with a log fire going in the middle of the room. Louis himself was there offering warm and friendly Cypriot hospitality. Twice we were offered extra helpings of our favourite dishes at no extra charge.The meze we had was one of the best we've ever tried. There were no average dishes, each one offered its own joys bursting with flavour.The pork souvlaki in particular achieved that rare balance of being flame grilled but still succulent. As is expected there was more than enough to eat but Louis encouraged us to take as much time as we wanted, bringing the next dishes only when we had finished with the last.Truly a great place to eat and now a favourite of mine, I'll be going back again! -Alexandros",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We do prefer our birthday dinner parties at Louis for the last 13 years!!! Last night we really enjoyed grilled food, mushrooms( not able to receive the recipe) fresh vegetables and abundance of side dishes each of which was better than the next!!!Of course fruits, sweets and coffee on the house, all served generously and authentic smiles!!! Keep uo the good work Louis!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We went to Louis tavern about a month ago. We were a group of 10 people and all of us absolutely loved the food ! The tavern is located in one of Pallouriotissa's main street so it is easy to find it. I have been to 80% of Nicosia's taverns and to be honest I don't know why I haven't heard about this tavern before because it is the best tavern in Nicosia! The quality of the food and the service is amazing! Meze is 18euro per person but it also includes fruits and sweets and the variety of food is very good. I especially liked the mushrooms, snails, and the chicken. But honestly everything was excellent, food and service. I highly recommend it!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"i would highly recommend louis taverna.7 of us ate here,the meze was excellent,my personal favourites wes the mushrooms cooked in garlic and butter,and the aubergines in a zesty tomato sauce the hosts linda and louis were very attentive! and i would have to say to anyone visting nicosia to go and give this restaurant a go! you won't be disappointed steve anna and family.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,This summer was my third visit to Nicosia and Louis Taverna was recommended to me by a local. We were treated like one of the family and the Meze was by far the best I have ever had. Can't recommend it enough if you want a simple relaxed meal with attentive and entertaining staff then Louis should be top of your list when you come to Nicosia.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We visited Louis Taverna on 19th JuneWe arrived at 6.30 p.m. not realising that the tavern did not open until 7.30 p.m. However the owners would not hear of us going for a wander and coming back they insisted that they sat us down and got us drinks and nibbles etc. They were extremely friendly people and the food? well what can we say it just kept coming and coming brilliant very tasty typical greek hospitalityFaultless Service, faultless food and excellent evening was had by us both and we will visit here every time we go to Nicosia in the future",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
10,"Based on the others good reviews, we went and regretted so much. We went as a family of 4, 2 small girls who barely eat much adult food. We wanted to order 2 portions, but the owner insisted to have 3 portions. The portion is small for a typical Cypriot tavern, because we eat out a lot and we always order 2 portions till now and usually can't finish the food. The so-called 3 portions are actually smaller than the 2 portions that we got elsewhere. For a family of 4 including two young children, paying 60 Euros for a casual dinner including 1 water and 1 beer is a bit too much for the crisis Cyprus now. Also location is a bit of in the middle of no where, parking is for 1-2 car. The worst part for me is the salty food - even one of us is Cypriot who is used to salty food, agreed the food was too salty. We will think twice now by choosing a restaurant based on the good reviews by others!!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,Propably the best taverna in Nicosia! Great food! Plenty of choise and very cheap. Very polite staff.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,The food was fairly ok. There were some really tastefull dishes. Only sieftalia and meatballs were not cooked evenly. There was nobody at the entrance to welcome us and there was no menu available. Once we sat down meze starts coming with nobody asking you if you want to eat meze. We went intending to eat cypriot kebab and we end up eating meze. It costs 18 euro per person FYI.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"After not visiting Louis tavern for a while, I went with some friends last week and I have to say that the food quality and the friendly service of the owners are exceptional. The meze is top rated and the new ideas that the owners bring into their menu is a bonus - I loved the idea of the souvlaki on the lentisk branches, beautiful and creative I have to say.And my friends that ate there for the first time also loved the place, small, unique and authentic.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
30,"The food was ok, it is the typical meze you can find in many Cypriot Restaurants. The service was very good .I do not think this is the best restaurant in Nicosia. I will not hurry back.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,This tavern is simply amazing. The excellent service combined with the tasteful food and the correct price will give you an experience that you will never forget.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"We ate here on a Friday evening, on our arrival we were met by friendly staff and were quickly seated. We had booked in advance and just as well as the restaurant filled to its capacity within minutes .We had the Meze and it was served at a relaxed pace. Every dish was piping hot and freshly cooked. At the end of the meal was the usual complementary Brandy . Great value for money. We would definitely return.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"Like most people I guess I went here on the back of the positive reviews, first thing that struck me was the simple friendly welcome, really attentive service, very fresh cooked meze, Don't think it should be No1 but certainly worth a visit. Then you can walk down the road to The Hard Rock Cafe and spend as much on a cocktail as meal at Louis Taverna!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"What makes Louis Tavern stand out from the rest of the tavernas, is the high quality, genuine Cypriot meze dishes served right from the start. The emphasis is not so much on quantity but quality. All dishes were delicious and well prepared. (The snails were absolutely superb!). Service is excellent and although not inexpensive, the quality of the food makes the whole experience good value for money. Would certainly go there again.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"We visited this local restaurant a quiet rainy night. The service was excellent (the owner even helped us park the car!). There was nice Greek music on the background and the several dishes started coming almost at once. There was a good variety of dishes and were all tasty. The wine suggested by the owner was also very good.I would like to make a small suggestion, though. If the portions were slightly bigger, the place would be full of people every night. I think it would be better to raise the prices slightly (by 1 or 2 euros) than offering just a meatball for example, to each customer.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"First time in Cyprus and looked for local cuisine - checked Tripadvisor and went to Louis Taverna, and had a perfect evening. We ordered a bottle of the best local wine ( and it was good!!) and meze - and then the most delicate and tasty small dishes started arriving at our table. Fresh salads, spinach with fried eggs and homemade grilled bread accompanied local smoked ham and cheese, spicy local sausages, meatballs, fried calv's liver, lamb chops, souvlaki chicken, pork chops etc... Everything fresh and very well prepared by Louis' wife who came in and had a chat.What a meal - you can't find a better example of the delicate local kitchen....and for all that we paid less than 60EUR for 2 persons.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,We went to Louis taverna for a birthday dinner and loved the atmosphere. It was quaint and very traditional. The meze was really good and there was a LOT of it. The owner was very friendly and accommodating- we were celebrating my friend's birthday and since we didn't bring a cake the owner's wife went and got one for us. A great place to get a taste of local cuisine and hospitality!,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
30,"Really I cannot understand where this wave of 'excellent' votes come from! It's not a bad restaurant! But doesn't deserve to be no.1 restaurant in Nicosia! Come on! We went there after reading all the comments and yes, when you appear being the best here you expect something really good. Food was average-good but that was all! I liked the mushrooms very much! Souvlaki veery medium. Snails were good! Salad was very good. Pork fillet with tomato on top had a strange after taste I didn't like. Keftedes (meatballs) were average, my mum makes better and she is not on tripadvisor:) liver was good, vegetables with eggs I found them very bitter ( if I am not mistaken you keep them in water to take bitterness out before you fry them). Service is very friendly and atmosphere homey. It is value for money but certainly NOT the best in Nicosia. The reviews rating it so high I don't say necessarily they are fake but maybe these people didn't try other taverns in the city. Maybe for a tourist this is a highlight but certainly not for a local client!!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Louis Tavern and Restaurant is a tavern that I actually passed by many times during the day going to work, but it was overlooked, maybe because I would usually speed by its location on the main road of Palliouriotissa.I decided to visit the restaurant with a couple of close friends, as part of our bi-monthly night out to catch up and eat without spouse restrictions. Our Wednesday evening visit was truly quite, but it wasn’t an issue because really what we wanted was good food, that was filling, decent service and to have a great catch-up.Our order was simple where it was a meze for 3 (we were told during the summer there is also an al a carte menu), a couple of large beers and bottled water.In summary, I’d like to say that this establishment, although basic in decor, provided a warm cosy environment, enjoyable Greek music and personalised service, in the traditional local Cypriot way. The food quality was of a very high standard, reminiscent of what it used to be like at taverns before Cyprus became overly commercial.(Timing)Arrival of the food items was neither fast nor slow, but perfectly balanced to allow for chit chat digestion and anticipation rather than frustration.(Waitering service)Excellent service, Cypriot service by a genuine local (I‘ve seen top notch service from our family of Europeans friends, but Cypriot hospitality which has strong links to speaking our dialect, understanding our culture and our mentality is really something I miss which is rare to find nowadays), who periodically engaged us in quality and good humoured chit chat, non intrusive and was kindly accepting when we were complimenting the food. Upon paying the bill, I realised the great service had come from the very polite and non-pretentious owner, Mr. Louis.(Food quality)I recall around 22 meze dishes (maybe 1 or 2 more), that included the salad, pita bread plus appetizers, oval chips and 10 protein dishes ( 7 meat, 1 egg, 1 liver, 1 escargot). We were impressed that every single dish seemed like it was cooked, prepared or grilled just before serving. From the taste and texture we could see that all the ingredients were fresh and nothing was under or over cooked. The meats were tender and moist, salads fresh, pitas looked like they were freshly baked, along with excellent appetizers and dips. A few examples....The chicken souvlaki was so moist that it practically melted in our mouth, the lamb chops were super tender with an incredible natural grilled taste and even the common keftede was so outstanding that we just looked at each in awe. I have to say something about the Cyprus sausage which I discovered in the end was of in house production. This wine cured sausage was the genuine material. This was the rare breed of sausage that you would only be able to get from artisan village masters, utilising untainted village red wine with hand cut quality pork meat. If I had the option to trade all the other excellent meat dishes for more of this dish, I would have done so, without hesitation!(Value for the money)This is a high value for your money establishment. Although each dish is exactly portioned for the number of meze orders, on a cumulative basis, you walk away very filled up indeed. We asked for a top up to a couple of extra appetisers where we were accommodated immediately, although in the end we were overly filled.(Final remarks)My personal opinion is that taverns such as Louis are truly exemplary in the way traditional Cyprus meze should be prepared and cooked. It’s the place that you want to put on your default list for life time visits and would never worry about letting your guests down. The management is obviously very conscious about maintaining a high standard on every single dish and based on my own kitchen experience they must have a very well organised engine room and will not hesitate to not serve a dish that does not meet there established high standards. If I had to recommend to the CTO an establishment (as part of their gastronomy tourism planning process) that could showcase quality traditional Cyprus meze dishes, then this is one of those taverns, I would unequivocally add to that model list of commendable cuisine showcases from Cyprus taverns.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I decided to visit this tavern today with my friends curious about whether the reviews were right to be raving about it. I was pleasantly surprised to discovered that they were. the food quality was above most taverns I have visited in nicosia and comparable to some of the best taverns of the island found in other cities. We were a party of 4 and while everyone of us eats a lot, we were left satisfied. The owner even offered us to bring more food without charge if we were still hungry. We kindly refused. Excellent value of money in my opinion because of quality, quantity and service. Bill was 80eu for mezedes for 4 persons including 2 large bottles of garlsberg, 1 large bottle of water and dessert with fruits. Timing of the service was perfect and the owner was very friendly and helpful.Only drawback I could find is that if you sit outside the road can be a bit noisy, however it didn't really disturb us. I recommend the place and will definitely go again in the future!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,I visit some days ago the Louis Taverna and is for me one of the best Traditional Taverna in Nicosia. When i am visiting a restaurant what is count for me is what i get i my plate! Not interest about the decor etc etc.Food- Fresh and tasty!Wine- served perfectlyService- Very GoodPitta bread always available and without ask for more all the time!We pay 99 euro full meze for 4 Persons and a bottle of Wine and 3 bottles of water. For me a very good price as well.I will go back again!,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Very good food (including cypriot and greek cuisine), well cooked (just right) and served in proper manner and timing. The place is nice and warm, quite ideal for couples, families and friends alike. The excellent and most welcoming service of the owner and staff, when combined with the excellent interior design (of classical greek and cypriot themes) and a great choice of greek folk music playing in the background, sums up for an exquisite experience for all who visit this excellent restaurant (tavern). Highly RECOMMENDED, cheers.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
30,"I visited this place on the back of all the excellent ratings it has received on TA. Although I did not dislike it, I left disappointed. At the time I visited it was ranked #1 n Nicosia on TA.Pluses:• Food was tasty and freshly cooked• Wine was served at the correct temperature. The list of local wines was good.• Waiters were attentive and not intrusive• It is not a chain, it is a family owned and run placeMinuses:• The biggest problem by far is the restaurant’s location. It is on a main road frequented by boy racers on motorbikes, and the noise - at least during our meal – was uncomfortably intrusive.• The décor is basic• The amount of food is quite small by local meze standards. Although compared to other parts of the world, it might represent a good value, judged within the context of Cyprus, I think it is more expensive than average.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,"we went there with a couple of friends.the meze was actually very good.well cooked dishes from Cyprus cuisine, nice and quiet atmosphere. The service was excellent, the waiter didn't' let us wait for more than a few minutes.As for the price it was reasonable.Try it.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,One of the best restaurant in Nicosia. Excellent food and service. Highly recommended.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant

50,"One of the best taverns in Nicosia if not the Island, the food is just top of the range! I eat there every time I go over from the UK.Its very reasonably priced if not under priced for the service and quality of food.They do offer the best mushrooms, grilled marinated pork,tahini,fresh POTATO chips none of that frozen stuff!!!Louis is there in person always serving with a smile, and makes sure everything you need you will get.Linda will often make an appearance to make sure the food she has prepared for you is to your liking.I can not find a tavern that can serve all those dishes, with the great atmosphere and in a good location.The tavern it self is located close to the city centre!",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
30,"I am surprised at the ratings of this tavern. The quality of the food is nothing out of the ordinary and the quantity and variety is below the average of truly superb taverns in Nicosia. Having read earlier reviews, we thought that the place will be fully booked and on our visit on a weekday we realised that all through the evening we were only 6 people there and, therefore, service could not be less than efficient.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,This little restaurant is really nice. It has a friendly atmosphere and some great food. Prices are very competitive (20 eur). Make sure you are hungry as you will get a lot of food! Staff is super friendly and outgoing. Worth the trip.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
40,Pleasent and popular restaurant - a bit pricey but I wasn't paying!! I enjoyd the food and the owner and host was very nice,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I have been to Louis's Tavern many times and have always had really good food and exceptional service. Father and Son are very attentive without being in your face which makes for a relaxing evening. The food is meze, plenty of it and importantly is not just loads of dips and bread to fill you up its meat and more and beautifully cooked. This is a favourite place of ours and we love taking out family and friends with us.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Went there with a group of friends and we all felt very welcome from the moment we walked in. I read the reviews on trip advisor and they were not wrong. Great food, fantastic atmosphere.And don't worry if you are a vegeterian (I am)- all I did was mention it to Loui and they made sure I was not left out.The food is so fresh and delicious, I will def be visiting again.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I am working here this week and an old friend (Cypriot) recommended that I went to Louis Tavern to eat. So I said to my colleagues ..lets go! We were not disappointed. When we arrived we received a warm welcome, wine list provided...no need for menu!! The meze is amazing..don't struggle trying to work through a menu because Louis..knows exactly what to serve...chicken, pork, beef, fish..it doesn't matter its all delicious..and if your vegetarian..don't worry plenty of variety to include everyone. I would highly recommend this lovely business. We visited on a Wednesday ..quiet but perfect.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,Very authentic and hospitable. The food is delicious and the service friendly and attentive. Great place to go when visiting Cyprus.,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
30,The overall experience was very niceBut the meze was nothing special - average quality foodService was not that great even for a family restaurantThe desser was very good,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"If you would like to try typical Cypriot “meze” while in Nicosia there’s no better place to go. Great Cypriot hospitality, superb atmosphere and the food just mouth watering (best lamb chops I have ever eaten). I really do recommend to anybody who wants to try Cypriot cuisine to visit that restaurant.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"I have been to Louis' tavern on several occasions, for both pleasure and business. And in all instances the food has been overwhelmingly magnificant. The atmosphere feels like home and the hospitality of both Linda and Louis is heartwarming. Whenever I am in Nicosia, I just have to stop by and indulge myself here in the typical Cypriot hospitality.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"Louis Tavern was my favorite place to eat in Cyprus while I lived there. It is a small, intimate space with a great fireplace in the center and the food is to die for. It is meze so all small plates - the mushrooms (i still dream about it), the eggplant (yum), hummus, chicken,etc ... I'm getting full just thinking about it. Go with a empty stomach and good friends for the best meal that you will have. It is the best in Cyrpus.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"After the first visit, we were hooked and have been back many times since. The whole family enjoys the meze. We recommend that you go hungry as you will leave bursting full. There is a wide variety of different Cypriot dishes served as a traditional meze. Everything is served freshly cooked, hot and delicious!! The salad is crispy fresh and traditionally served with feta, the Tahini dip, which I know is homemade, is the best I have ever tasted. Every time we visit we have requested a refill of both (and appreciate that it is never charged). My husband and sons love the variety of meat dishes (chicken and pork souvlaki, fillets, sheftalia, sausages, liver, lamb chops), my daughter the mushrooms with garlic butter dish and egg rocket dish. These are just some of what is offered!!!!! It is real value and quality for what you pay. From our second visit they remembered us and the warmth in which we were received made us feel at home. I also really appreciate the fact that we can pack up all the left overs and take them home with us for the next day!!This experience is an absolute must, If you truly want to experience home Cypriot cuisine.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,If one wants to have one of the best quality meze in town then Louis tavern is most definitely top ranking. I have visited this taverna on numerous occasions and the quality of food has remained at its best. The food is well cooked and I love the mushrooms and the liver fillets. The waiters (father and son) are always smiling and ready to serve you. Whenever I have friends visiting me from abroad this is the first choice of tavernas to go and eat meze since I consider it one of the best value for money tavernas Nicosia has to offer. I will most definitely be going back!,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,I have been to this restaurant many times in the past and it really knows how to keep its standards. Louis Tavern is very famous for its meze. There is a wide range of different dishes from grilled meat and casserole dishes to local Cypriot sweets and they are all delicious!!! The quantity of the food is another reason which takes us back to this tavern. Never have we managed to eat it all.Mr. Louis and Mrs Linda welcomed us in their friendliest manner and we had a great time.I am definitely looking forward to visiting Louis Tavern again soon!,Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"A touch of Cyprus at its best, a cypriot meze that makes you go back for more. This restaurant ticks all the boxes for a lovely evening. A family run taverna who are all very frendly. If you require a touch of old tradition then this is the place to go both in the summer where you are able to sit outside or in the winter sitting inside with a log fire burning, enjoying your meal and listening to the backtound music. I live in Limassol and heard about this restaurant from a friend of mine in nicosia.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"i have to say that this is the best (meat) meze tavern that i have been. although i live in paphos i frequently i travel to Nicosia and Limassol to dine out.I went tothis tavern in february after friends reccomending to me.Small place with a fire place in the middle of the restaurant. there is no a la carte menu but only meze with Cypriot and Greek wines starting from 14 euro to 30 aproximately.The service its simple but most important is that its genuine and not fake like in other places. i think its a family business with father and son in the service and mother is the chef from what i heard.Now about the food!!!!! there is a lot of food with top quality and when you go make sure that you have empty stomach.Many of the dishes are the typical Cypriot like souvlaki, shieftalia, lamp chops, chicken souvla, kioftedes but the special for me was the liver and thepork fillet. what i liked the most was that the dishes were coming slowly and in pairs for example meat with mushrooms e.t.c.another very improtant think for me was that i have asked for a second salad, tahini and souvlaki with out any extra charge not like some other places they ripped you off charging for every single thing.At the end of the meal they brought as homemade sweets and fruits and i would say that the meze its real value for money (18 euros p.p) without drinks.My only critisisem would be that the red wine was a bit cold, i notice that they have a small cava for the red wines which i would recommend to reduse the temperature but this was nothing.i cannot wait to go again and i think during summer there serving outdoors",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
50,"This is a Cypriot meze taverna with great food, the mushrooms alone are worth going for !! The waiter ( the son) is friendly and charming and Louis the owner ensures everyone is welcome and warm by serving drinks and adding wood to the open fire place! The food is tasty and plenty with a large selection of meze dishes that are all expertly cooked, we have never been able to finish them yet! We are always made to feel welcome, its good value for money and we will defenitely be returning! Well worth a visit to any one living in or visiting Nicosia.",Louis Tavern & Restaurant
