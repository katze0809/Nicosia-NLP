50,"Excellent food, great atmosphere and service.Cosy & elegant after renovation. Dine-in 5* experience!!",Akakiko
40,"Visited Akakiko Nicosia, a few weeks ago after the renovation and loved the ambiance! The passionfruit caipiroska was delicious and so were all the sushi dishes we ordered.",Akakiko
50,I have a delivery in this restaurant. Have amazing food. I enjoy so much. And also very fast delivery. Thank you so much your amazing work.,Akakiko
50,"We went there for a lunch break the other days. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the waiters are polite and presentable. The food was good, we ordered some sushi, edamame and some more starters. Overall, it’s a bit pricey but overall it offers good quality food so totally worth it.",Akakiko
30,A quick meal after a long flight. The dishes were well presented including vegetable tempura. However some of the veggie sushi lacked any real depth of flavour.Not sure if I’d return,Akakiko
20,"We ordered the oh sushi platter, eal and a crab salad. We have sushi often, so we know what to expect. The sushi they served us was not cold, it was almost frozen. Some pieces didn't even have any taste. The warm saki wine we ordered was lukewarm. The corner they sat us in had a problem: cold air was coming in from outside. We told them about it and they said they knew there was problem and just looked at us. We asked them to out the heating on (one if those bars hanging from the ceiling) and they did. What kind of hospitality is this? You know you've got a problem and instead of being proactive, to try and keep your visitors comfortable and warm, you don't bother to turn on the heating? We wanted dessert but instead We quickly ate and left. We will never visit again.",Akakiko
50,"we enjoyed the sweet potato wontons, the salmon tataki, the prawn tempura kataifi and the yasaiitame and they were all mouthwatering. service was outstanding and highly professional.",Akakiko
40,"A wide choice of dishes, reasonably priced. Quality is good but could have been better. I find there’s either too much mayo or cream cheese in the maki rolls. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff.",Akakiko
30,"I visited this place several times. However this time they Changed the menu ...! Sincerely I prefer the previous menu ... the new one is limited choice but better choices for sushi and maki. The duck with pineapple was average, the tick noodles with vegetables were tasty .. the rest was just ok as well as the service. We paid around 50 euros for 3 persons excluding alcohol.",Akakiko
50,Nice place / atmospheric. Staff friendly and helpful. And in a good area with easy access and parking place.,Akakiko
40,"I'll start with the negatives: decoration is outdated and ambience could have been better. Also, the service was slow; first to last dish served were separated by one hour. It could have been cleaner as well.Now, the positives:The menu is extensive and inclusive. The food was amazing. Chicken dumplings were incredible. Miso soup was simple but balanced, bento box was very good although the glass noodles were a bit unbalanced and overwhelmed by kimchi, chicken noodle soup was brilliant, although the chicken was a bit dry and the broth was slightly unbalanced (maybe it could use some dashi). Sushi was incredible; rainbow maki was simple, clean and vibrant and the dragonite was complicated and layered in both textures and flavours (sidenote: the carob reduction was inspired and the crispy carrot was crispy and dry, as it should be, but was a little oily, usually indicating dull ribboning blades).",Akakiko
40,"Good food, convenient location, friendly staff, recommend dragon maki rolls na d thai chicken. Value for money",Akakiko
50,"Food was good with great portions. A young employee tutored by a more experienced one served us together and they were both friendly and helpful, making sure nothing was missed on our order.When I accidentally threw away my rating voucher card, another employee along with the tutoring one had no problem replacing it for me and my girlfriend.Keep up the awesome work guys.",Akakiko
50,"The service was excellent, the food was ready pretty fast and everything that we ordered was delicious!",Akakiko
50,The service was great. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was good. Good for families too. Sushi great,Akakiko
50,Excellent food. Great sushi. Great dishes. Amazing atmosphere. The service is really and the chef can alternate any dish u want accordingly.,Akakiko
50,"Very nice food, well cooked. Tried cashew chicken and Tori Itame chicken. Big portions. Delay on take away.",Akakiko
10,I do not recommend this restaurant. food not good and very slow service. we ordered tuna sashimi and we got sashimi I don't know what fish. we just got cheated. service very rude. we waited 20 minutes for the bill to be settled. horror!,Akakiko
50,I ever had. Service was very nice. Food was freshly cooked. Staff was very friendly. Atmosphere is nice. Parking is not that good. Best sesame chicken.,Akakiko
40,"The service was excellent. Very quick, friendly and when they mistakenly brought us an extra dish apologized and let us keep it without charge. We had the duck roll which was good ( a bit dry but better with the sauce) , the beef bao buns , sushi and two mains. Food was very nice and consistent throughout. Pricing is very decent for the quality of food. Would highly recommend.",Akakiko
40,"The only reason why I am not rating the restaurant with 5/5 is because their food is not as good as it used to be. Also, on the last few visits they are running out of food like the strawberry mochi or the lobster for the candlestick. By far the best thing in the menu in my opinion is the candlestick.",Akakiko
10,"I place my order through foody, which has my address saved. The delivery man was given the wrong house number. He called me numerous times because he was at the wrong house and hung up the phone three times. Also he couldn’t speak any english so i couldn’t explain to him where the house is. After 10-15 min he finally understood where the house was and when he came he was very upset and rude, blaming me that i gave the wrong address.",Akakiko
50,"Very nice and cozy place. Well lit and modern design. The food is tasty and beautifully served. The staff is friendly. The prices are high though, but you get what you pay for.",Akakiko
40,Shrimps were delicious. Sushi was ok. Ambience nice. This is Cyprus so don’t expect the best sushi or Japanese flavours but for a change from Cypriot food it was nice,Akakiko
50,"Great dining, great taste, great service, great variety, it deserves every star. Especially their crispy popcorn shrimp. Incredibly delicious.",Akakiko
50,"The food is delicious, it seems like they put a lot of thought in every dish. There are options for vegetarians and vegans and also for gluten free diet. The atmosphere is nice and the sevice is spectacular. They have a great deals for quick lunch. Definitely worth a visit.",Akakiko
40,Several times I visited this place. The food was tasty and nicely presented. The service was good and the prices reasonable comparing to quality.,Akakiko
50,First Japanese restaurant my partner had ever been to He was amazed at not only the food but the wonderful service You have to book But our best meal of the holiday and we have eaten out every day Well worth a visit,Akakiko
40,"Delicious food, especially sushi. Expensive for what they are but you can go for specials. Nice atmosphere.",Akakiko
40,Food was fresh and tasty. Loved the sushi - really nice selection available. We went with a group of friends and had a great time. Although the sushi was great the mains were not so good - they lacked seasoning so it was pretty plain - shame as otherwise the sushi was really good.,Akakiko
50,We often visit this restaurant with our family for lunch or dinner. Nice casual place. Delicious food. Professional staff.,Akakiko
50,"Excellent sushi and very unique combinations of food tastes. Really enjoyed this restaurant, as it’s interior is very beautiful. Service was very good. It’s a bit expensive, but the quality of food deserves their prices! recommending this place :)",Akakiko
50,I go to this restaurant from the day it opened in Nicosia. It has some of the easiest menus to order with a great variety of japanese delicasies. I have visited numerous japanese restaurants but I find Akakiko to be the the most consistent in every dish and every time I have visited. Try the oh sushi selection. Is just great.,Akakiko
40,"Akakiko serves an awesome tasteful dishes, from sushi, seafood, to all kinds of meat. With an excellent decorated dishes that tells you. ""You have to eat me!"". Simply amazing.......",Akakiko
50,I went there with my wife. We ordered the mezo chicken soup. Absolutely amazing taste and so fresh and rich.,Akakiko
10,"I do not recommend it at all. Very expensive in relation to the quantity of food, very small portions. Very slow service.",Akakiko
50,"Every time that i try something new is say 'this is my favorite dish'! So i guess i like them all! Last night i tried the Black Bean Cod! Excellent dish for the 'no meat lovers'! They have a variety of dishes for vegetarians, for vegans, for sushi lovers for everything! My dish was an explosion of different kind of tastes! The cod was very fresh as all the other ingredients, extremely tasty, the black bean sauce was a perfect match with the cod and the vegetables! Sweet atmosphere, very kind and quick service! Love it ever more!",Akakiko
50,We have eaten in this restaurant on more than one occasion and have always been very happy with the food. There is a very good selection and would definitely visit again if in the area.,Akakiko

30,"Had a nice dinner with family, only issue was the service!! Just didn’t seem like they had a grip on it!!",Akakiko
40,"Nice food, reasonable prices. This restaurant keeps its quality for a long period of time! We visit at least once every couple of weeks. What you expect is always what you get. Definitely recommended for japaneese in Nicosia.",Akakiko
10,"We’ve ordered next things:Tom Yum - why the hell you call it Tom Yum if you don’t use coconut milk? Seriously...Ramen soup - please, please, PLEASE, don’t use sodium glutamate is such amounts. It kills the taste first of all, and it’s not healthy. And why the hell do you use korean instant noodles? They are disgusting.Tuna sashimi... sahsimi suppose to be made of fresh fish? Why it is half frozen then?Never ever coming back.P.S. drinks and cocktails are fine!",Akakiko
30,The ambience is nice . The attenders were very good and their approach was exemplary The quantity of food also was good.But the prawns served was not okay as a stale taste was there. One of the server said that during this season the taste of prawns is like that which was not convincing at all.,Akakiko
40,Great fusion taste- good service - good atmosphere - good prices. We visited the restaurant with my family for dinner - very good selection of fusion cuisine- well cooked - good service and good prices. We will visit again for sure!!!,Akakiko
40,Pros: Great food Great service Okay prices Lovely decor Cons: There is really nothing I can think of!!!,Akakiko
50,"On a busy night, even though we didn’t have a reservation, they found a table for us. Good, polite and quick service, reasonable prices and big portions.",Akakiko
50,Visited Akakiko Nicosia on a Friday night. Although very busy they found us a table without a reservation. Staff was very welcome and kind. Quality food and perfect service. Will visit again and again 👌,Akakiko
50,Hearing a lot about asian restaurant in nicosia we decide to visit Akakiko restaurant. All dishes were amazing very friendly staff and excellent atmosphere,Akakiko
10,"Ordered the yasai teppan for takeaway, as listed on the vegan menu. When the dish arrived, I found it contained pieces of chicken. Completely unacceptable.",Akakiko
30,The food is great and it's a nice place but be prepared to sit and wait on service. You have to try really had to get a servers attention.,Akakiko
50,Lunchtime is the best time in my opinion for this restaurant. There is a special lunch menu which is very reasonably priced and offers excellent food. Portions are large so good to share if you have smaller appetite. Service us quick and efficient.,Akakiko
40,I like it a lot The atmosphere is very relaxing The food is always well cooked and tasty Value for money regarding the prices,Akakiko
50,This is the place to eat when you want something Asian. They offer delicious sushi and amazing cooked recipes from all the far east region. It is by far the best restaurant of its kind in Nicosia. Book ahead as during busy nights you might not even be seated on the bar. I usually eat once a month here and never had a problem with anything on the menu. Some recipes are not completely authentic in order to appeal to the European crowd but are still delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant.,Akakiko
50,"All was perfect!!Especially sushi!!Variety of sushi ,even with chicken!The restaurant offers quick lunch in week days with only €8,90!!",Akakiko

50,"The best place to enjoy mix of Asian cuisine, with a refreshing cocktail and after all of these a cup of coffee with handmade dessert.Every time being in Nicosia is our place, not only because the food and its quality, but also because of the prof staff serving there.",Akakiko
50,"A lot of restaurants of this kind of cuisine opening but honestly AKAKIKO is simply out of competition.The BEST quality of the food and this funny,smily and friendly staff,makes you to go again and again.Not only to eat but you can go also to enjoy a cocktail on the bar.",Akakiko

50,"Absolutly asian cousine, friendly staff good prices higly recommended. Plenty maki dishes and sushi.",Akakiko
40,If you are looking for place for a quick bite other than the standard sandwich you should visit AKAKIKO. Special quick menu available at a very reasonable price. Ni reservation needed for lunch but highly recommended for dinner. Very good sushi.,Akakiko
40,The sushi here it tastes nice. Big selection of sushi to choose from. Nice salads. Clean restaurant and very good service. The only negative i have to say is a bit overpriced.,Akakiko
10,Quality has deteriorated and the menu has changed to offer cheaper dishes of worse quality. sushi is disappointing,Akakiko
20,Sushi (maki mix) was ok. Service somewhat slow and had to battle a bit to get waiters attention despite only 5 or 6 tAbles going and three waiters and a manager on.Seemed that chit chat at the bar by the staff was more interesting.Decor is ok but some of the chairs are wobbly and old and the seat cushions stained/dirty in some cases.Saw the manageress clear a table and ended by removing crumbs/spilt food by swiping her hand across the table and on to the floor. Didn’t use a cloth or sanitizer.,Akakiko
50,They have the best sushi in town but it’s a bit overpriced but I would definitely recommend it for someone who wants to treat him self. The stuff is very nice and the restaurant is very clean,Akakiko
20,"We stayed at the Hilton Park and decided to give a try after eating too much Cypriot food and it was disappointing to say the least. We live in Asia and to be honest we didnt expect the food to be super authentic, so we had low expectations to begin with, but the food was simply put, BAD! its just off when it comes to seasoning, im not sure if the chef actually knows what yakisoba is suppose to taste like...maybe its hard to source authentic asian ingredients? Sushi was a large blob of rice with frozen fish on top...i mean it was bad Asian food, BUT the restaurant was crowded on a Tuesday evening so im assuming that it caters to local palate...i guess if you never had authentic Asian cuisine this is great!Service and ambience was great though!",Akakiko
50,The place and atmosphere is perfect. The meal was delicious and staff was very helpful and cheerful. Love the place!,Akakiko
30,"This is the second time I review Akakiko, however, it's the third time we go after the previous review, so what I write here reflects several visits. Last time I gave it 4/5 and had said sushi was quite good. The past three times we went, sushi quality wasn't so good - not so fresh, slightly stiff and too cold sashimi. Service remains good. Verdict: I am not going back, until I hear from people that quality improves. There's no reason to drive all the way to that area. One way to mitigate this is to lower prices so as to justify mediocre quality.",Akakiko
50,"We visited Akakiko a few days ago and we had a lovely dinner! Great appetizers, a variety of sushi, delicious man dishes, amazing desserts and very good wine! Topped with the great service, always with a big smile! Value for money, but with elegance at the same time! We will definitely be back soon! Thank you for the lovely night!!!",Akakiko
10,"wanted to visit akakiko for a long time, having heard very good comments about their sushi. fortunately apart from our main dishes that were tasteless we had one portion of 8 sushi so at least we ate something. Sushi was also basic. Quality was very bad, fried duck was almost not eatable. We left very disappointed.",Akakiko
20,"I have been to akakiko Restaurant before for sushi dishes. This time my daughter and me wanted to try Chinese dishes. The taste was very normal, does not reflect the reputation that akakiko have nor does it reflect the sushi standards.Sorry, but the food was average.The service was very slow, we had to call the waitress every time we needed something. Food was delayed in which we had to remind them to bring the starters and again reminded them to bring the main course",Akakiko
30,"I guess a lot of dishes here have been modified to match Cypriot taste. Some of the raw fishes are not very fresh, but hot dishes are good.",Akakiko
50,"Traveling around the holidays can be tough, when everything closes down. Everything in the neighborhood of our hotel was closed, but we found the Akakiko near the Hilton. The place had a nice holiday buzz, the young and trendy staff was friendly, and the food was good. We got the Bulgogi Bibimpap and the Spicy Honey Chicken - both nice and very filling. Prices were reasonable as well!",Akakiko
50,"Perfect place to eat and taste fusion plates ,very good service ,good prices but the best is the Chef!!!",Akakiko
50,We either visit the restaurant very often or order online. Whatever we choose to do we are very satisfied with our orders,Akakiko
50,"good food, good and helpful service, reasonable price for EU (I think a little high for Cyprus). I'm a big guy and was pleased with the size of dish I received.... I will go there again.",Akakiko
40,"eating there almost every month with family. always good hospitality, modern restaurant and the more important top quality and variety of food. the only reason for not giving 5 stars is the price of the dishes.",Akakiko
50,Excellent food and fast service. Very polite waiters and very professional! I have been a regular customer for 5 years and the food is getting better and better! Keep it up!!,Akakiko
50,"Wonderful atmosphere, very friendly staff, wonderful food and very child friendly, highly recommended",Akakiko
40,"Must visit, great food and friendly staff. When in large groups I warn that food will take a while and most likely there will be some orders that are wrong. Best to stick to the menu and not change items. Best for dinner but great for a lunch break away from work. Keep an eye out for the lunch special menu, got some great dishes.",Akakiko
50,Ultimate Professionals! So wasted ordering Pizza Hut and sushi la until I tried Akakiko ! From their excellent user friendly website to my door step and then my stomach ! Simply perfect ! Just don’t disappoint me now that u raised the bar !!!! Keep it as it is!!!,Akakiko
40,"Been here a couple times and I'm always impressed...Love ordering different plates with my friends and trying a bit of each...Sushi is amazing...presentation is spot on, drinks are awesome!Service is average to working on excellent.It is in a location where there are other restaurants in the vacinity and even a hotel.I have one less star as service can always be improved.",Akakiko
50,"Wonderful food. Been twice, both times excellent. Nice staff and atmosphere and reasonably priced Each time I have felt well fed but not overfed and I'm going back again this week",Akakiko
50,"It is not the first time I’m visiting this place and I am always pleased. Tasty food, nice service and pleasant place. I recommend",Akakiko
40,"A great variety of sushi, noodles, salads etc. Traditionally when I visit Akakiko I eat sushi. Do not forget to try their cocktails.",Akakiko
20,Average service and too expensive for fancy decorated sushi. Nice ambience and convinient location next to Hilton hotel.,Akakiko
50,"wide selection of japanese and Asian food . very tasty , large portions and menu is changed to add new dishes ! ambiance is great with low music. good for friends and families and business lunches. the prices are very reasonable. must visit",Akakiko
20,The service was very mediocre. I had to call the waitress back to take our drinks order. The waitress was not trained at all. She didnt know the products being offered. Our daughter's meal arrived a half hour after ours! To top it off we actually sent the duck springvrolls back because they smelled awful. They even tried to charge us for the duck! I had to complain for them to remove it from the bill. We were not impressed at all.,Akakiko
40,"Visit restaurant with family. Sushi platter we ordered was nice and tasty, service was good. Atmosphere was nice but too noisy because were many people in the place. Suggest a reservation before going.",Akakiko
50,"We enjoyed the variety of sushi and maki rolls we ordered. Our only comment is the waiters who didn't seem well trained, one of waiters could only communicate in Greek. The other waiter mentioned that she was confused by our order. Suggest more training before receiving guests.",Akakiko
50,"Excellent service, the staff was very polite, cozy atmosphere with relaxation music!!! The quality of the food was perfect and very well decorated!!! Recommend it to everyone who loves japanese cuisine!!! There are plenty of choices in food as well as drinks!",Akakiko
50,visited akakiko for one more time a few months back. the new menu was amazing we mainly ordered cooked maki with candlestick maki being the best so far and a tempura hrimp salad.,Akakiko
50,"Very tasty food ,good fares ,good deserts. Good service. Excelnet location, i liked the design ,very helpfull stuff.",Akakiko
20,"Poor service mediocre food.We had a reservation for 12 people. Things started off badly as drinks took avery long time arriving. I can understand that it takes some time to make a cocktail but a beer or water shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to arrive.As there were so many of us we split into groups of four, to help the staff and to make ordering easier. When our food arrived it was all jumbled together. All the sashimi ordered was on one platter, orders one group had ordered were given to another. In short a complete mess.Food was very hit and miss. The tuna was frozen, the scallops were great. No consistency.To make amends they offered us free dessert and a discount which we appreciated however we had one final problem. We asked to split the bill into 3 equal portions (to pay by card) but they informed us that you can't split the bill into equal portions but can only split it by paying for specific items.Overall a disappointing night. Not sure if it would have been better with less people but based on last night I wouldn't visit again.",Akakiko
20,"I went to Akakiko for dinner with friends but left very disappointed with the food and the service. The place was very noisy as well with no music playing on the background.We ordered starters and as main dishes calamari, mango beef and duck with ananas sauce . The calamari was quite good but the other dishes very very disappointing. The beef had a smell and there were more onions than all the other ingredients.The cocktails we got were very sweet.I have been a lot of times for sushi to this place but definitely not going again.",Akakiko
40,"We were a company of two and we visited Akakiko for lunch on the 18th of August. As soon as we entered there was no one to greed us at the door so we waited a bit since a lady spot us and said that we can seat anywhere we like. The menus reached our table immediately and drinks were ordered and arrive without any delay. We ordered from the lunch special offer menu: duck roll, which was very good, and pikatsou rolls, which were ok but nothing special, for starters. Our main was a fantastic and very tasty pork belly and a not very tasty chicken Yaki Soba. The last dish is definitely something I will not order again. Overall the two dishes allows per lunch offer are more than enough for a hungry person.The venue is very nice and service was very good. Only a case a spot with a neighbouring table of ours. It was an Asian company of three and when the lady reached the till to confirm that they still waiting for two more dishes, the lady waiter was not polity or helpful with her. The male waiter standing behind her realised and helped the customer. As soon as the customer moved back to her table, which was not more than 3 steps away from the till, the female waiter started complaining in Greek and making faces. If she was not the one responsible what she could easily say to the guest is ""Just give me one moment madam to check with my colleagues"".On the other hand I need to give a huge bravo to the male manager who as soon as he entered the restaurant he straight up got involved and the service and also in the meals preparation.Name tags should be used for staff members. Also basic polite manners and standard phrases used in frequent clients' request must be advised to the lady. All the rest of the staff were super polite.",Akakiko
50,"Great ambiance. Excellent service. Large array of options. Impecable dishes. Creativity, imagination and respct with regard to igredients. Very clean. But you are paying for the priviledge handsomely.",Akakiko
30,"The service can definitely improve, since the waitresses were not paying much attention. It was very cold and we asked them to fix the a/c three times but nothing happened, even though they were telling us that they were changing the temperature of the a/c every time. It took them literally an hour to serve us the edamame and the sushi - we ordered them as starters. My main dish had too much sauce and as a result I couldn't eat it. Thankfully, they didn't charge us for that plate",Akakiko
40,Very nice restaurante. Modern arquitectura and decorations. Tasty food and very friendly service. Recommended!,Akakiko
50,The restaurant is ver modern clean and tidy.The food is very tasty and served in a nice way on the plate.They do not take long at all to do your order.Could be a little less pricy,Akakiko
50,Perfect food excellent fast service .. the staff was amazing..very good prices..The restaurant is very clean :),Akakiko
40,great place for fusion food with amazing tastes based on japanese cuisine mostly - very close to hilton park hotel,Akakiko
30,"The food was good in Akakiko. The place is informal and agreeable. The service was hopelessly efficient. What do I mean? We asked that individual dishes come in a series. Instead all was dumped on our table within seconds of each other, which made a nonsense of a meal. The impression was of an management attitude 'you order, we bring, we forget you until you want a bill'. If this suits you, this is a decent place. If you want a pleasant, prolonged meal, go somewhere else.",Akakiko
50,"Greed got the better of us when we saw the mouthwatering menu I'm afraid. Healthy portions of duck spring rolls and spicy edamame followed by Maki, filled us up before the sweet and sour duck arrived. Good food and great service. Too near the main road to sit outside so I'd recommend you reserve a table indoors.",Akakiko
50,"A good night out with friends, excellent range of cuisines and drinks, high quality ingredients. Moderately priced, staff efficient (could be a bit friendlier).",Akakiko
30,The food was good but I think the waitress was not happy at work or probably it was her first time taking orders and serving.,Akakiko
30,"Akakiko offers a lot of different asian dishes. The quality is good, especially the sushi is great but the other cooked dishes are very average. It's worth giving it a try.",Akakiko
50,"Fusion Japanese cuisine. Part of Hilton Park Nicosia, Akakiko is a modern busy restaurant serving fusion Japanese dishes and impressive sushi dishes. Very busy on weekends with moderate prices and professional service. Booking highly recommended",Akakiko
50,Loved the consistent quality of food and service. Nice fusion food. Friendly staff. They do delivery as well!,Akakiko
40,"Have been visiting Akakiko since it first opened in Makarios ave 15 years ago. It has lost the concept it had at beginning: good/great food at reasonable prices in a casual surroundings. Now it is a 'fine dining place' , still go but not so often. Food is good, however not of international standards, and competition for sushi have same and better options. Service good, prices depend on what u order.",Akakiko
50,"I ate in Akakiko (3 times in one trip) last year when visiting Cyprus on business and loved it. So, on a return visit this year i have been a frequent visitor yet again (3 times during the 5 day visit). So i guess that says how much i like the place!As someone travelling on their own, it's sometimes difficult to feel comfortable dining in a restaurant alone but the team at Akakiko always make me feel really wecome. The option of dining at the bar is also great for me as there is the opportunity to talk to others, as well as being sat in a great people watching position.As for the food, i've tried several dishes and they have all been brilliant! Service has been fast, food has been delicious and i think it is great value for money.I hope to be back in Cypus soon to dine in my favourite place here. Thanks to the Akakiko team for a lovely experience - on both visits!",Akakiko
50,"Definately a nice place to eat, every few months the change the food bringing new flavors to the table. Must say management and chef are doing a great job here",Akakiko
30,I went there with my friend tasty food good service we will go back for sure the good thing is that they make take a Away and delivery,Akakiko
30,"I've been visiting this restaurant a few times now. The food is really good and you have a nice variation of dishes.If you come at lunch time, they have a ""lunch Manu"" which provides great value for your money!The only down side witch sadly is a real con - it takes them a really long time to bring you your food...",Akakiko
30,"The people serving us were friendly but seemed a bit inexperienced and overwhelmed given it a very busy day. Beer came after fifty minutes and three tries. Placed in front of a two year old, probably because he was sitting closer to the bar! The prawn damplings we ordered were transformed to pork buns...even the names are not similar. A plate was dropped and shattered in our feet. Food was good. We've had better days here.",Akakiko
50,"Had not been for years and was not disappointed! Great food we had sushi, sashimi and chino chicken (i believe it was called) very nice tasty at filling- we could not eat it all. Good service and at a very good price.",Akakiko
40,"One of the four or so restaurants in the Hilton Park Nicosia is the Akakiko. The menu offers a variety of fresh sushi, sashimi and maki, complemented by delicious hot dishes such tempura and teppan styles.I had the vegetable dim sum starter (5 pcs/€5.50) served in a bamboo steamer. I usually like my potstickers fried but don’t mind them steamed. The was followed by the ebi (shrimp/prawn) maki (stuffed seaweed roll, 12pcs/ €12) and the California temaki, a small seaweed cone (€4.40) stuffed with prawns, avocado, cucumbers, and crabsticks. Although a Japanese restaurant, I ordered a local beer (Keo, 330ml/€5.50) as I prefer to try the local brew when I travel.The offerings were tasty and the service was fast and efficient with no mistakes in my order.",Akakiko
50,"The place is nice looking and it's always busy at the weekend. You will need to reserve a table. The food quality is good, the service could be better.",Akakiko
40,"Japanese fusion restaurant, good food at it's best and excellent service to go with. We went here for a quick lunch and it did not dissapoint-fabulous and tasty food.",Akakiko
40,"Very good quality of food, freshNess of the products that have been and excellent service. Also modern design!",Akakiko
50,"Very nice setting with a large variety of food to choose from! Excellent dishes, delicious and well presented, with fresh ingredients and in very good prices! The service was very good also! Their lunch deal for 8,90 is great also! We had the caramel dessert also which was one of the best desserts we had, absolutely delicious! They have a nice wine selection with good prices also (e.g. 16,50 for Kyperoundas winery roze wine!) Great experience and a place to visit if you like asian cuisine!",Akakiko
30,What I ordered was above average. I ordered sweet and sour chicken. I had a better one. Next time I will try something else.,Akakiko
50,Good delivery time and well packaged food. Food was delicious worth it for a nice evening at home. Highly recommended,Akakiko
50,"Beautiful space adjacent to the Hilton Park Hotel very easy to find! A true sushi experience with a great menu, very professional staff and good cocktails. On the pricey side of the bar, however it worth it!",Akakiko
40,"We're here by big family middle of the week place is packedBetter book priorGood I'd good, portions are very big, you can share it for two easilyNice atmosphere , nice ppl, some women have evening dressCuisine is adopted of course, better ask waiter make food more oriental",Akakiko
30,None of the dishes ordered impressed us. The tofu soup was mediocre and the sushi lacked finesse or an interesting twist. It was priced as a high-end Japanese restaurant but failed to deliver.,Akakiko
10,"I believe food quality should be the first criterion in evaluating any restaurants. It was one of the worst Japanese restaurants in my life and I doubt the ingredients are fresh. I ordered seafood ramen and prawn dumplings, and as soon as they brought the food, it was hard to breath because of fishy smell. I barely had one third of the ramen. The best choice I had was grapefruit juice. Hard to believe it's ranked at top level.",Akakiko
50,"I ordered a toasted prawn (starter), some sesame chicken (main) and 3 caipirinhas. Every item was done in near perfection. Service was good too. The ambience of the place was also very good. If you stay in or near Hilton Park Nicosia, this is a very good place to walk in and have a meal.",Akakiko
30,Wasn't impressed by the quality of food and especially the duck and the shrimps.It used to be so much better than that. Only thing standing was the polite service,Akakiko
30,The atmosphere is very classy. The service is very good. But the taste of the food is not extraordinary.,Akakiko
10,"The order taking was disjointed and we had more than one waiter taking the order, our soup did not appear until after the sushi starter was finished and the main course was on the table, and then only because we pointed it out, instead of an apology all we got was a muttered ""it's on the house"". One of our 4 main courses was completely forgotten and by the time it came the other 3 were almost cold (we wished to eat together). my Szechuan chicken was a few tiny pieces of chicken deep fried in batter, it had the taste and consistency of soggy cardboard, I needed to smother it in soy sauce to get any flavour at all...It was Sunday lunch but at 2.30pm getting quiet and there was no reason, apart from complete apathy on the part of management and staff, for such a dismal and pretty expensive meal.",Akakiko
40,I loved it when I went there with some of my girlfriends. The staff were helpful but not overdoing it and the food portions big and delicious.,Akakiko
50,We have arrived at 9 and the place was getting crowded until 11 pm. The sushi menu had interesting choices that you cannot find on other places. The taste was good and the ambiance was classy. I recommend you to try the restaurant if you are around nicosia. Post note: The molten chocholate cake must be improved.,Akakiko
10,"Arrived without a booking to a restaurant that was almost empty, was asked if we had booked, when we said no they put us on a table next to the waiters station.This was our first time at Akakiko, and when we asked the waiter about certain food on the menu, he was not keyed up at all as to the dishes.THE FOOD.The steamed prawn dumplings were soggy and tasteless, you could tell that the prawns were not fresh, the sushi was also somewhat tasteless and also so soft you could barely pick it up with the chopsticks, the worst dish was what they called a Thai Beef Curry, which was again absolutely tasteless and had no sign of curry as a taste nor any taste of Thailand, hmmmmmmm wonder if the owner has any idea of what oriental food tastes like.SUMMERYif your looking for oriental authenticity and to enjoy a good sushi, then don't bother, go to one of the chains that do it and you will not be disappointed.AKAKIKO has pleasant surroundings and gives you the impression that you will be wowed, forget it, do not expect anything special at all.Over priced what you expect to get.I would not go again",Akakiko
50,Very good Japanese 🏯 restaurant 🍴 but the music is too high for the restaurant but the food is nice,Akakiko
50,We had no reservation and although the restaurant was full with people they found us a table. Our waitress was very polite with a smile on her face. She had excellend knowledge of the whole menu and she advised us for our choices. The food was very tasty and well cooked. I will go again for sure!!!,Akakiko
40,"Their sushi was quite good; the sashimi was above average, and miso soup very good. We couldn't say ""excellent"" because it could have been better. For example, the sashimi was slightly cold (which betrays, was not freshly cut, but was in the fridge for a while). Service was very good. Atmosphere was also good, albeit the ambient acoustic was not great (too loud). All in all a very good restaurant, which could improve. Slightly overpriced. We would recommend it.",Akakiko
50,"Is restaurant is the BEST restaurant in cyprus which provides the chinese/Japanese cuisine. Their restaurant is well designed, the suff is polite and well organised not to mention that their service of food is really good. I dont have anything negative to say which means how good was my experience. I've been a lot of times to this restaurant and i alwyas like it and leave with a smile and full stomach . Bravo Akakiko.",Akakiko
50,"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant in Nicosia.After a number of visits, I know that what sets it apart is not the great variety of Makis, many of them being really nice, but the exceptional quality of main dishes. Many of them are nice both in presentation and in taste.I hope it would be a bit easier to get a table though.",Akakiko
40,We enjoyed a very good lunch there the other day. Food is fresh and i loved the prawn curry. I also had one of theor freshly squeezed juices which i reslly enjoyed.,Akakiko
50,We went last night with my husband for dinner. We had no reservation and although the restaurant was full with people they found us a table. Our waitress was very polite with a smile on her face. She had excellend knowledge of the whole menu and she advised us for our choices. The food was very tasty and well cooked. I will go again for sure!!!,Akakiko
40,"The whole atmosphere is good... The staff are polite and willing, the food is above average (for Japanese cusine in Cyprus) but between the time the order and the time the food comes to the table there is a looooong interval!We had to wait more than half an hour to have our food served!",Akakiko
40,"Very good menu selection of the tastiest sushi I've encountered (it should be something to do with the rice preparation which doesn't clog dry your throat as in the rest of the sushi places I've been to...) but also offers near perfect vegetable, fish or meat warm dishes. This restaurant chain which for me turned out to be a gem in this city, is well established as a better quality restaurant for a considerable amount of years now, but only lacks in a couple of things, the decor, which is between taverna and beach bar, and the long waiting for food preparation (if ordering warm food). The staff is well prepared and quite professional, not casual. Overall, the dining experience is great. Prices match the food.",Akakiko
50,I visit Akakiko very often with family as well as friends and workmates. The service is always excellent as is the quality of the food. The prices are what you expect at a restaurant of such standard but not astoundingly pricey. Definitely in my top 5 list!,Akakiko
40,"Akakiko serves good quality japanese food at reasonable prices. Atmosphere is also quite pleasant. If only noise level was lower, would have gained a 5 star rating by me.",Akakiko
50,"One of the best Asian restaurants in Cyprus. Excellent sushi, very good noddle dishes and a huge menu!",Akakiko
40,"Nice place, nice atmosphere with decent food. Price is quite reasonable on food but a bit excessive on drinks. You need to book in advance.",Akakiko
40,"Really good dishes, excellent seaweed salad. We love the sushi and maki platters and much more. Better service is needed though. I also believe the management should reconsider the prices too.",Akakiko
40,One of the best meal I ever had....I will love to be here again with my friends....thinking of having lunch with my friends on my birthday,Akakiko
50,This is the place to go if you love sushi and want to enjoy it. Am not a fan by myself but this place is exceptional. They make the best sushi in my opinion in Cyprus! Big place make a reservation in advance it can get really busy on nights especially weekends.,Akakiko
30,"This time we left Akakiko unsatisfied and disappointed. The sesame chicken (which so far was my favourite) was tasteless, and the stuffed beef with mushrooms was just mushrooms covered with a thin layer of meat and tasted like...mushrooms! Moreover, they forgot to bring our wine, and the desserts menu were definitely not Asian - no banana tempura, just desserts similar to those of any restaurant.",Akakiko
40,Not really a fan of Japaneese food but Akakiko can serve you some really nice dishes! The location near the Hilton Park Hotel in Nicosia is really convenient and comfortable. My lady and I loved it there!,Akakiko
40,"Good variety of food, you can chose different kind of plates: chicken, meat, fish, sushi, etc...spicy, mild sweet, etc... Sometimes the service are very slow. In general, no specific issues.",Akakiko
40,"A good experience. Sushi is good, there are a lot of choices. Also special dishes are worth trying. All my colleagues were satisfied too. It's not on the cheap side but I think prices are reasonable for the quality. Will come again.",Akakiko
50,we usually go there go service good food location is easy to find friendly waiters must try one of best places to eat,Akakiko
40,"We came to this restaurant two times. First time was lunch, the place was empty and we got the food fast with very kind service. The sashimi tuna and salmon was exceptionally great so we decided to come again a day later to dine. We came at 20:30 tha place was fool but they found us a place on the bar. The service was not so good anymore as the waitresses were distracted and the food took time. But it was defenetly worth it!",Akakiko
40,Very nice restaurant to have your sushi. Very good prices. Nice atmosphere. Very good service. They have also a very nice bar with good cocktails,Akakiko
40,"I ordered Salmon sushi and a salad and another sushi with mango dish. I thought that the Salmon was too thick and not too fresh and the salad had a lot of dressing, I just shared the comment with the managers and I insisted that they include the charges for these dishes however they insisted in removing it. The service was extremely pleasant and the waiter tried everything to enhance my experience.",Akakiko
50,High quality food at great prices. Two course Lunch special at 8.90 is fantastic value with a big choice of dishes on offer.,Akakiko
40,I tried the quick lunch with a group of friends on a working day. I was pretty satisfied with the portions and quality of food. The only problem was that they were really late to bring the main course .. We were waiting for half an hour for the first plate and after that they brought the rest of the plates every five minutes.. which means the first 2 plates were cold and non edible... Our lunch break was finished - since we waited for so long - so we took most of our food 2 go. The good thing was that they gave us a discount for the delay..,Akakiko
50,"Just perfect! Very good Food, variety of plates, great service and environment! Definitely recommending it for a romantic evening!",Akakiko
40,"Enjoyed a great array of Japanese delights for a quick dinner Great food, friendly staff and reasonable prices.",Akakiko
30,"Had a business lunch with some quests that wanted to try Asian cuisine.I had been there myself before and I liked it but this time around it wasn't so nice.Service was merely there.Food below standards. Sushi was very fancy (decoration) but not much taste and the quantity very little.Noodle dishes , we tried the yaki soba,Was tasteless. A noodle dish with salmon was Ok.The sashimi platter we had was very very very little. Small pieces of sea bass. Salmon was Ok.",Akakiko
30,"We really enjoyed our sushi and cocktail at Akakiko however the mains were not of the same quality unfortunately. The beef was far away from being chewy and the chicken lacked taste.All in all,we are definitely going back for sushi.",Akakiko
50,"I am not a sushi fan, but the asian cuisine of Akakiko surprised me. Comparing taste and prices, i can say that i stayed very satisfied. High quality of food.",Akakiko
40,at akakiko you can combine going out to a restaurant and a lounge bar at the same time. the ambiance is nice and the food really good. a bit expensive though.,Akakiko
40,"The food is tasty, in fact very tasty - the sushi is fresh and light; the sashimi is good; the pork buns taste like real pork mince buns and the teriyaki and salads are all above average. The Mount Fuji Roll was very tasty as was the tofu with soya bean; sweet and sour crab salad was a little sweet but then Cypriots and Greeks like their Asian food on the sweet side. The service was quick and efficient and the staff polite and welcoming, the setting was pleasant; the decor fresh minimalist; the toilets clean and no one seemed to be smoking inside, which was a bonus. I recommend this restaurant for family, social or business occasions. The staff readily brought extra ginger to the table and did not charge. Overall good quality and good value.",Akakiko
50,"The setting is perfect, the food is delicious and we really had a great time.. After my visit there I even ordered delivery via the web.. The response was immediate and even in delivery the food was excellent! Don't miss this restaurant and of course don't miss the avocado soy sprout salad, the katsu scallop maki and the spider maki!!",Akakiko
40,"Good food, good atmosphere, good service, good value. Special lunch menu. Some fusion dishes and salads. Easy to find.",Akakiko
50,High quality sushi and the best with huge difference! Had my first time there and really enjoyed it! I would recommend Akakiko to friends and family for true and tasteful Japanese food!,Akakiko
50,Great Japanese plates and sushi. Great selection of beers. Great atmosphere. Great service. Good selection of wines.,Akakiko
40,"For Japanese and sushi lovers, Akakiko is one of the few places that can validly claim to have authentic choices in a nice setting.Even though not for the budget conscious, the choice of dishes and the variety of tastes across starters, main courses and desserts makes Akakiko a favourite for an Asian experience.Will certainly be visiting Akakiko again!",Akakiko
40,"For people who like Japanese menu and sushi dishes, this restaurant is suitable. Furthermore service is good.",Akakiko
40,Good place with a very elaborate menu & good ambiance. Good staff. Food was good but nothing special.,Akakiko
50,We were here for business dinner. They have good selection of sushi and main dishes. Service is good and everything is clean and tidy.,Akakiko
30,Akakiko is by the Hilton Park in Nicosia was fair. I like sour and sweet chicken but other friends couldn't finish their foods. Pastas are not pretty well and staff would be more professional. It was a normal experience.,Akakiko
30,"I was staying next door at the Hilton Park hotel while in town on business and ended up visiting Akakiko on a couple of occasions. My first visit was for lunch with my wife & a work colleague and we all really enjoyed it. The food was yummy and lunchtime deal of two courses for €8.90 is amazing value. But I was disappointed when I returned on my own for dinner late one evening a couple of days later. Maybe I just made a bad choice but - in contrast to what we'd enjoyed previously - the Indo seafood dish that I ordered was really quite poor. Four stars for my first visit, two stars for my second so three stars overall.",Akakiko
40,"open till midnight, will find everything japanese, lots of quantities (the Cyprus people EAT a LOT!!!!), good overall.",Akakiko
50,This restaurant serves high quality Asian food. We have been in this place countless times... Sushi menu has many options to choose from and its freshly prepared with nice decor....the standard of the food is always high and service is quick and friendly even in busy times....the place is modern and has nice background music...This place is always busy so it's best to book in advance....,Akakiko
40,"Restaurant serves Asian food. Usually prefer to eat different type of duck there. Some deserts are good too. But be sure to book a table if you plan to go for dinner Friday or Saturday night, otherwise you won't get the best seat.",Akakiko
40,Unfortunately it is the only restaurant of its kind in this part of Nicosia that is why its the destination of choice for japanese. Quality is ok. Prices also not so bad.,Akakiko
50,"amazing restaurant, delicious dishes, fantastic plate decoration. would reccomend it to anyone that likes japanese-chinese-indian!",Akakiko
50,"Despite the fact that the restaurant was full, the service was fast, the staff really helpful and friendly and the food amazing (as always)! Plus a few surprises for the night (champagne, roses & dessert buffet)! Really enjoyed the visit! More than excellent dinner!",Akakiko
30,Staying in the attached hotel and couldn't be bothered finding somewhere else. Fresh and modern decor with music playing in background. Large food choice on menu and relatively tasty dishes.Staff hovering over me every 3 mins which is a personal hate of mine.Would I come back? Probably not...,Akakiko
50,"Couple of years ago I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. However, after the new menu was introduced few months ago the quality has increased a lot. Really nice food and excellent sushi. Very unique flavours in the food. The only negative is that a little bit expensive. It costs an average of 11.50€ for a california roll (8 pieces)",Akakiko
30,"As the reviewer on 24 November I was disappointed that the professional photos in the attractive menu and the actual dishes didn't match; okay the sushi looked like sushi but it was dull and a little dry. For my main course I had a squid dish which looked super in the picture but what arrived was a long plate loaded with chopped onions, green peppers and carrots in a sticky gloopy sauce with some bits of squid buried in it, the same flavour and gloopy texture running through the dish. It looked like something knocked up by a student in a frying pan. I was tempted to send it back but couldn't be bothered to wait so ate the squid and left the rest.Otherwise, nice decor and pleasant service except that the waiter who seated me was clueless on the menu and couldn't make any recommendation.",Akakiko
40,Very good variety on the menu for every taste. High quality food and service accompanied with reasonable prices according to the portions!,Akakiko
40,"Recently, I have been introduced to the quick lunch offer from this restaurant and I can say it was delicious! For the price of 9,90 EUR we got to choose two dishes, or a starter and one dish, and the portions were huge and tasty! I really loved rolls with duck meat. I have to say though, there is not a good variety of vegetarian dishes.",Akakiko
10,"The only thing that it's not fried or dipped in mayonnaise sauce is the sashimi at Akakiko. I order a ramen soup for a light lunch. The first attempt was a bowl with deep fried duck, extra boiled noodles, vegetables and no liquid, so no soup. I sent it back and they just added broth or something. If the menu stated that the duck was deep fried for this dish, I wouldn't order it at the first place. The service was nothing special.",Akakiko
40,"A very good reason to visit Akakiko is the delicious sushi they serve. It is always freshly prepared and nicely presented. The quality of their other Asian dishes is not so consistent however, especially when you use the delivery service. Staff are attentive and the decor of the place is quite modern.",Akakiko
30,We expected better service and found the food rather tasteless and dry.. it has a good location. Could be improved,Akakiko
40,I loved the new dishes on the revised menu. Let's hope the taste will not change with time. I loved the new additions to the oriental cuisine as well as the new sushi tastes.,Akakiko
40,"Very good food, but noisy and also to warm (it was a cold day and they had to much heat on) Service ok, but a bit slow. A bit pricy for Cyprus, but worth a visit.",Akakiko
50,"Beautiful atmosphere, variety of options in the menu and reasonable prices, what else can you want? Perfect mix of Asian cuisine, pleasant staff, exemplary service.",Akakiko
50,Its a great restaurant with the most delicious japnese food. Its a modern restaurant with a locely design and which offers food daily for lunch and dinner. Their makis are exquisite and so are their warm dishes. Lately they have added new deserts which are delicious. Depending on your budget you can find the relevant food to order from cheap up to expensive.,Akakiko
40,"A large place, pleasant environment, very good and prompt service. Although it might get crowdy at times (it's better to make a reservation), it still feels comfortable. Plenty of choices in the menus. Food is fresh and served promptly. Tasty dishes and large portions. Food at this place was much better compared to other asian restaurants that I've tried in town.",Akakiko
20,I visited Akakiko on November 17th as I was told that the restaurant offers authentic Japanese food. The service was decent. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get our food but its taste was nowhere close to Japanese food as the sushi rice was bitter and the tempura felt too oily. I am visiting Tokyo and Tochigi on a regular basis every 2 years and I can clearly admit that the food in Akakiko should be advertised as Asian and not Japanese. Not a restaurant to visit if you are on a low budget.,Akakiko
40,"Being a big fan of Japanese food, I always try different restaurants. This is not a bad place to taste some of Japanese cuisine, but the taste wasn't that fresh or rich.",Akakiko
20,"OK,so the staff were fairly pleasant but not the best meal experience I have ever had.I was so excited for this place because I've heard so many great things about this... but as someone that loves Asian food, I should've known not to listen to all the people (who don't normally eat Asian food) that raved about it. The food was tasteless to say the least. I ordered their roasted duck and it tasted more like beef than duck... and the duck didn't even seem like it was roasted. It was disappointing. The only reason why it's 2 stars is because the service was pretty good.",Akakiko
40,"Although Nicosia is not famous for its Asian cuisine, I can safely say that Akakiko is the best. It's quite pricey and the staff could be friendlier, but the overall experience and actual food is very good. The sushi is especially good and there are lots of other choices, from meat to poultry to vegetarian.",Akakiko
30,Visited few times the restaurant and had such a nice experience on the tastes. The service though is very food. Understaffed restaurant which is expensive. If you pay that price you expect to get the service though. Last time i visited 2 main dishes were served 1 hour and 45 minutes after we ordered them. 3 bottles of wine and i had to poor all 3 myself on glasses....,Akakiko
20,"Akakiko is a Japanese restaurant, but the dishes are cooked with a different philosophy in mind. Some are too sweet; others are deep fried. Clearly, the cuisine has been adapted either to a Cypriot palate, or to the palate of the cooks (who are certainly not Japanese). Portions are large. Still, it is a convenient option for guests at the Hilton Park.",Akakiko
30,"On my first visit to Akakiko, I left pretty satisfied. Everything we had ordered was delicious. My second visit was a bit of a disaster. The fried tempura prawns dish was full of oil and literally inedible. We were also negatively surpised to hear from the staff that almost all the dishes have garlic sauce, and this kinda ""forced"" one of my friends to eat only salad. Further, we noticed that the actual dishes to be served are far away from their corresponding pictures in the menu.",Akakiko
50,This is a great restaurant to visit for business lunch or dinner.good customer service and nice environment. Strongly recommended for everybody that loves the Asian/Japanese cuisine since you don't have many options of Asian/Japanese options in Nicosia,Akakiko
30,"Nice and modern, nice and polite waiter services, very big menu. Some of the dishes are not up to the standar. Not good quality of meat, very bad quality of beef dishes, trying thai beef was full of veg, no sauce, rice very cold.",Akakiko
50,Akakiko is the top destination for sushi in Nicosia.A very calm and well designed place. Excellent food quality. Interesting coctails at the bar. Excellent service and management. The managers always take care of every lottle problem that may occur at no time.One of the best experience for Asian dining.,Akakiko
40,"The atmosphere is amazing! The food is very good, very nice cocktails, hight quality alcohol. The service was ok.",Akakiko
40,Good Japanese restaurant but very expensive for what it offers you. Τhe day we went was crowded the service was mediocre and the food for the money was not as we expected.,Akakiko
40,"Service was excellent, waiter was knowledgeable. Food was well prepared, and regardless of what a recent review stated, good value for money - you're not dining in a souvkaki shop! We had mixed seafood california rolls and maki followed by a mix of mains which come accompanied with rice and seperate salads. A great choice for sushi and Jaoanese styled food.",Akakiko
50,"Yummy sushi! And great service. This restaurant gave me desserts, drinks, bottle of wine, and sushi rolls ON THE HOUSE!!!",Akakiko
40,"we really enjoy our sushi selections. there are plenty of choices in sushi menu but it was reaaaalllyy expensive.!! the hot dishes were terrible . each and every plate was ""with sauce"" but actually were untasted. only for sushi !!!!",Akakiko
40,"I tried this restaurant at the insistence of my wife who, having spent several weeks in Japan, is much more familiar with what constitutes a decent sushi restaurant than I. this was my first sushi experience and I was not disappointed . Even though it was Friday night prime eating time and we hadn't booked, we were still given the option to eat at the bar - which we did. The menu was given to us within 60 seconds and it is enormous. Obviously the sushi and sashimi contribute to much of the menu but there are so many more choices, mainly Asian Fusion, for those who do not like the idea of eating raw fish and before last night I would've been one of those people . The food was fresh and bursting with flavour and arrived at our table very quickly. If you are new to sushi and want to try it for the first time, this is a good place to start . It does feel a little 'franchised' but who cares, it's good food at a good price. 2 starters and a sushi platter for 2 plus €18 bottle wine = €60. We couldn't quite manage all of it. Recommended.",Akakiko
50,"This is a great restaurant to visit for lunch or dinner. Value for money, excellent customer service, nice environment. There is a variety of food to order, sushi, maki or other teppanyaki dishes, whatever you like. Strongly recommended for everybody that loves the Asian/Japanese cuisine!",Akakiko
30,A big hype goes around about this place but I've had better. It's missing the authentic Asian cuisine flavors and it feels like you're eating at a franchise restaurant. Service can be good or bad depending on who's shift it is.,Akakiko
40,"Went with friends for a meal. Service was excellent throughout our meal, very efficient and polite waitresses. Staters were large, freshly prepared & tasted lovely. Main meals tasty and well presented. Overall a lively relaxed experience",Akakiko
20,"I'm writing this both to warn off others and as a reminder to myself not to go to Akakiko again, despite its convenient location near my office. I've been there a few times, usually for business lunches, and invariably either the food or service - often both! - are disappointing. On the plus side, the sushi is judged OK by my wife or colleagues. But it goes downhill from there. The tempura is mainly batter that reeks of poor quality oil. Pad Thai is overcooked noodles with too many unauthentic ingredients, such as carrots and yellow peppers. Service has been inconsistent, and I vowed never to return after waiting for at least 45 minutes at lunch - with the manager eventually admitted that the kitchen had ""lost"" our order. To top it off, prices are too high for the quality of food, service and ambience.",Akakiko
20,Very poor food !lemon chicken and beef with black bean sauce dont even think about it...!service was very good!check others...,Akakiko
30,Food is overpriced and the portions are getting smaller as time pass. One kind of maki we order came with like two ingredients less than the description. Very noisy place.,Akakiko
20,The prawn Tempura was the worst I've ever had. There were huge batter shapes which poured out grease when squeezed with the tiniest prawn strips inside. The tom yum soup was missing the correct ingredient but still served without comment. When I asked why it contained no lemongrass I was told they didn't have any. The sushi was nice though. The wine waiter kept spilling the wine all over the table.,Akakiko
50,"We visited the restaurant for lunch. Hopefully, we manage to make a reservation earlier as the place was packed.We ordered a sushi plater and two dishes with sidings (we were a single pair). Everything was fantastic and we could not stop eating but, unfortunately we were full and our food was still sitting in our plates. Luckily, the stuff was kind enough to prepare the rest of the food for take away.I will definatelly visit Akakiko again, in order to taste more of its variety",Akakiko
50,Fresh sushi. Good rolls. Try dragon roll and candlestick. Excellent sesame prawn toasts and duck pancakes. All in all one of the beat value restaurants in town.,Akakiko
50,"I like the atmosphere of the new Akakiko (after it moved to its new location at Hilton Park hotel). It is very nice especially for couples (even though it can be a bit crowded sometimes).This is my place of choice for sushi as it serves consistently high quality, fresh and tasty dishes.It is a bit pricey but reasonable for a fine dining place. Parking is usually easy in the hotel's lot.",Akakiko
40,"It delivers right to the room at the Hilton Park Nicosia. The portions were so big, that I ate half for dinner and stored the rest for snack/lunch",Akakiko
30,"Good food, good service, not a bad location. The problem is the restaurant operates within a hotel now and it is always full. You can hardly find a table without reservation so it is not a drop by sushi bar. Sushi is high quality but not presented exactly the same as you see on the menu, that's a little bit disaapointing.Recommend",Akakiko
50,"Nice environment, good quality food, a bit expensive. There is a good offer for lunch applicable until 16:00 daily.",Akakiko
50,"Great food, huge variety, great portions, great service, great wine! All in all, if you ever find yourself in Nicosia and you fancy Asian kitchen, that's the place!Furthermore you can enjoy a drink or even dine at the bar. Romantic environment I would say. BUT...there really has to be something done with the music choices...",Akakiko
40,The place has a great variety of both sushi dishes and hot dishes for every taste. Their sushi is amazing and unique and not the typical sushi you can find everywhere. Their prices are surprisingly low. This is my favourite choice for Japanese food in Nicosia :)),Akakiko
40,"This is my favourite place for sushi in Nicosia, mainly because of the quality of the food, which is prepared by Asians. The service is not always fast, you need to make a reservation (even during weekdays) if you want to be sure you will find a place and the final bill is not that cheap, but it's worth it. I visit it about once a month and I can't wait for the next time!!",Akakiko
50,"The last time i had dinner there was 2 years ago, with the worst comments about portions and quality.The last dinner i had few days ago it change my opinion about few days ago was excellent, with great portions and excellent service.Everything was perfect!!",Akakiko
50,"Because this restaurant was around the corner of the Hilton Park Hotel we decided to have our dinner here.We read on TripAdvisor that the portions were not that big, so we ordered quite a lot of food. But after the Thai soup (the bowl was huge) and the squid, we were almost full. Then we had the Enoki sushi, the Szechuan chicken and a salad. All very delicious, but too much! We asked if they could put the salad in a doggies bag so we could eat it the other day and that was fine.The staff is very friendly and we can recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood.",Akakiko
50,"This restaurant came recommended so decided to try something different from the traditional. Selected a range of meat dishes from the menu which were made very clear from good photographs embedded within the menu. Decided on lemon chicken, Thai curry beef, duck, noodles, salad, wine and two rounds of beer. The quantities were adequate - not too much or too little as we finished everything. The only minor thing for me not the others was the sticky rice. Don't know whether I could have changed this. Also the wine a little dear. However, at 25 euros per head was about right for such a restaurant. Also the service was quick and curtious. Will go again for something different.",Akakiko
30,"Been going to Akakiko for years, and about twice a month over the last couple of years. Recently our favorite salad, the spicy tuna salad has been reduced to about half its usual size... Not sure whether this is a weekend thing, as most of our visits have been on weekends, but we get half the tuna for the same price.Otherwise, food is good would suggest the Kamo Shima (fried duck with vegs and rice) the candlestick maki, and the California maki.",Akakiko
30,"We have ordered 4 sushi plates, they were just ok . In the past the plates were better. There is a big level of improvement.",Akakiko
40,"as far as the place itself is concerned, i would say that is nothing special. Plates are rich, even though the duck i have ordered was more spicy than expected (it was not mention in the menu that was a Hot Dish), the quantity and quality was very good.",Akakiko
50,"As hilton guests we visited and the food was the best Japanese ever tasted. Not pricey at all, fast service and the good was amazing. Very good assorted wine list and great employees. Was very disappointed when we found it closed for easter holidays. Ordered take away and even brought it up to our room. Couldn't ask for a better and more proper Japanese dining experience.",Akakiko
40,"This is Japanese-esque. The sushi is I guess ok (yo sushi quality) and the sashimi a bit better-but there is no finesse at all from how the fish is cut to how the rolls are made. The hot food is a bit greasy so order and eat with care. Saying all that, it is a large spacious place, always bustling and busy and the service is good too. And I am happy to go there whenever I am in Cyprus.",Akakiko
50,"From the interior, service, price, to quality of food Akakiko@Hiton Park ticks all the right boxes. One of the busiest restaurants in Nicosia for a good reason. As i rarely book in advance i can recommend being perched at the bar which is probably the best spot in the house.",Akakiko
40,"Been twice during February. Both times ate the same plates but both times the food was different... nice but different! The second time we've been there with a big group of people. Some were very pleased with the food, others knew exactly what to order so that they will stay happy and others that never been there before and ordered by instinct were disappointed. Even though I haven't tried it (because I am a vegetarian) try the sweet and sour duck plate. Anyone who got it was so happy and pleased.",Akakiko
40,Akakiko offers the best asian menu quality and quantity around the city. we eat there almost every month and each time we find it better.,Akakiko
50,"I and my wife went to Akakiko last night. We ate kamo ramen, prawn tempura,califorian maki and fried ice cream. Fantastic",Akakiko
50,"Great well-cooked dishes with great decor and very reasonable prices. Also, do not miss the chance to try the best sushi in town. Without a doubt its the best restaurant of its category in Nicosia.",Akakiko
50,"Very nice ambiance/decoration, extremely polite and helpful staff and amazing food. Every plate is a mini work of art that satisfies all senses.We were also given a complimentary dish and we got to take our left overs home (portions were too big for me). What really amazed me was the attention to every detail (even in the take away bags you get extra chop sticks and cute little soy sauces).Reasonably priced for the entire experience as well as for the taste/quality of food (you can watch it being prepared)Highly recommend this to anyone for anything - from business lunch to romantic evenings.",Akakiko
40,"First visit at the new location,the food was amazing and the restaurant feels both casual and up-scale.Will definitely visit again.",Akakiko
40,The only decent sushi in Nicosia. The service is good and the food is fresh and well prepared. Highly recommended.,Akakiko
40,"The place is good and can definitely boast their customer service. The menu is long and everyone will find something to satisfy their taste. I'd say that the place is a bit too pricy but then again, the atmosphere is of an expensive restaurant.",Akakiko
50,"The atmosphere is vibrant, modern and relaxes you, I really liked the lighting. Huge selection of japanese cuisine. The stuff is willing to assist. Do try a glass of plum wine, it really completes the whole experience. You ll need to visit again to try even more tastes. Do visit.",Akakiko
40,"We came for dinner last night and were pleasantly surprised. Considering being in Cyprus the Japanese sushi, maki, tempura, wakame salad and the dumplings taste quite authentic (been to Japan several times already so have the comparison), portions are generous and ambience is nice (modern interior, open kitchen, big bar in the center and sofa corners) Prices are on the expensive side, but it is acceptable for what you get (Nicosia restaurant prices are rather high in general).The only little draw back was that the waiters seemed a bit overwhelmed by the full restaurant, drinks took ages and it was rather hard to get their attention. But overall recommendable and we enjoyed it!!!!",Akakiko
50,The atmosphere of the restaurant is great as well as the food yet you have to read carefully and seethe signs which indicate food are spicy or mild.,Akakiko
40,The food is very nice and the prices are average. The atmosphere is nice and can be romantic! i strongly suggest a visit!,Akakiko
40,I love the maki they have! Many different choices of food (from sashimi to chicken and from vegetarian to beef) and in a very good price! The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing! toilets are a bit far though - they use toilets located in the Hilton Park Hotel - but is only a small downside. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner with friend or for a date!,Akakiko
40,"Probably the best sushi in Nicosia at reasonable prices. Very good food, excellent service and depending on the time you visit you might get a nice relaxed atmosphere or a buzzy lively atmosphere during busy times! Very nice place! Great sushi and a variety of Asian plates means there is something to accommodate everyone's palete",Akakiko
50,the food was just perfect and very tasty and really done well...clean service is very good .. waitress and waiter are nice friendly,Akakiko
30,I visit many times this restaurant is average food but is very good atmoshere have many people every day the price is good if the food is litle bit better this restaurant willbe very good,Akakiko
50,"Ignore any negative reviews and give it a go. We have been 4 times so far in our two week holiday and love it.It's fresh and cooked in front of you. Obviously with most of the dishes being fried a bit of oil is used (responding to ""greasy"" comments below) but it's really tasty.Would say it's more Asian fusion that specifically Japanese but give it a go if you are not after a long sit down meal",Akakiko
40,"A very nice restaurant, good variety of sushi, good service and good food. The prices are not the cheapest, but for special occasions is worth it.",Akakiko
40,"The header of my review tells almost everything. A nice place to sit, the food of good quality. The menu lists a good variety of offerings that can satisfy all kinds of tastes. The service was good.",Akakiko
50,"Sushi is usually my first choice when I go out for a meal. Akakiko restaurant is much more than a place to have good quality sushi.It offers a variety of dishes to satisfy every taste: vegetarians, those who are fond of the Japanese/Asian cuisine, raw fish, cooked fish and meat.Although I have my favorite dishes, I often try to taste something new and I have never been disappointed. My usual choices is a sushi/maki/sashimi platter or a teppan dish which are of high quality, great taste and most importantly healthy, guilt-free dishes!Also the restaurant is a very relaxed place to eat and the service is excellent.",Akakiko
50,"Excellent restaurant in a convenience location. Very nice atmosphere, all details well attended, well presented food, great tastes.... very nice sushi and platters, good service.",Akakiko
40,"We went on a tuesday evening and ordered different kinds of sushi, a soup and the pop corn prawns, which are my favourite. Crunchi maki and dynamite were excellent! Our waiter suggested to us a rose wine and it was a perfect choice. The service was once again attentive, and the atmosphe relaxing. There is a large parking place next to the restaurant which is rather dark though and can be a bit scary for the ladies.",Akakiko
50,"The Akakiko restaurant is directly adjacent to the Hilton Park hotel where I was staying. You can reach it from the inside of the hotel. Went there on a Wednesday evening without reservation. It was quite crowded but they found a place. Service was very friendly from the beginning and throughout the dinner, willing to explain the different menu options and advice for the wine. I started with a miso soup from the house and then ordered sashimi, just excellent, delicious maguro (tuna) and unagi (grilled eel). As a main course I had an incredible delicious teppan of seafood in miso. It is seabass and sea bream filled with scallops, and served with rice, vegetables and salad. They also had my favourite Greek wine, biblia chora (Ovilos) available by the bottle, so that rounded it all up. As mentioned, service was really good througout, so the whole dinner experience was great. Without asking, they brought the remaining 2/3 of wine, nicely closed with a kork to take with me, nice gesture so I could savour it during the next days in the hotel.Overall, whenever staying at the Hilton Park, this is a great choice for dinner but I would also dare to say that it is worthwhile a visit from where ever you stay in Nicosia or even in Cyprus, so for me I will certainly return !",Akakiko
40,nice place with good food but the service is very slow very nice sushi and platters value for money nice atmosphere but a little bit noisy,Akakiko
40,"We visited Akakiko for the first time in their new address, Friday night. It was full but luckily we had a reservation. I had called in the afternoon to reserve and there was only available at 10:00 pm.Welcoming and seating was sort of impersonal as a fisrt impression but later on service was at high standards. There was some delay bringing the main course but acceptable considering the restaurant was crowded.Our starters were tasty, the best spring roll I've ever had filled with duck served with sauce and 2 pices of sushi. Our main courses were Seafood In Miso Teppan and Sesame Chicken. The first one was very tasty and well cooked , we didn't really like the Chicken as it was not crunchy outside and soft inside as I had expected, nor the sauce of it was something special. Presentation was nice for both dishes, accompanied with nice fresh salad and steam rice. We also had some noodles with vegetables, tasty but a lot of carrots in there as a proportion to the rest veggies.Prices were good costing us some 45 euros for 2 persons with a small sake and a soft drink. No dessert ordered as we had no much time ahead and had to leave.",Akakiko
30,Visited during a business trip on a Monday evening. The restaurant was not very busy and the atmosphere was quite relaxed. The food was good (I did not take sushi so cannot comment on that). My only disappointment was that the service was somewhat erratic - I put it down to a language barrier.,Akakiko
10,"I have been in the restaurant twice since it opened in its new location near Hilton Park, the design, atmosphere and location is very good and it has also parking. It also has a outside seating for smokers. BUT when it comes to food it´s realy very much bellow average. The sushi is so bad, that i dont recomend trying it, the rice is extremely overcooked and too thick compare to the fish other ingredients and salats are tasteless. I didntbtry any cooked meals or meat, those could be better but japaneese cousine is definitelly a No go. I wont come back!",Akakiko
50,"I do not understand why this restaurant is not listed in the absolute top of the Nicosia restaurant scene. I live in London and love my sushi and am convinced this restaurant can compete AND outperform many of the restaurants back home and sushi restaurants I have visited in Miami and NYC. Let me tell you why….In a nutshell: It is creative, delicious and delivers consistent quality on whatever you order! A rare combination if you ask me.Normally you might have your favorites if you order different maki rolls but what surprised me was that even though we tried many different dishes on the menu … all of them tasted as a minimum ""good"" and most of them were super tasty! The chefs are clearly trying to push the boundaries. Yes; you can go with the 'safe' options but i really encourage you to be a bit more daring ….. go off the beaten path and order something different. You will not be disappointed! Who could ever imagine that a Mango-maki or deep fired crab stick and smoked aubergine maki (yum!) could taste so delicious :). Or the Black Rain. It is all delicious, freshly prepared and portion-sizes are generous.And you know what the best thing is? I've only spoken about the sushi part. Where i think this restaurant really excels is on the hot plates. Especially the hot starters taste amazing! Pop Corn Shrimp, Peking Duck spring rolls or the Pork Buns .. all were yummy! We were so happy we were with a big group so we could try them all.In summary: Akakiko clearly tries to make you taste something different, something new! And whereas some places go over the top and create dishes that are not well balanced, here the balance is totally right. You wait in anticipation what the next dish will deliver. And you get to enjoy a nice setting where service is professional and friendly. So if you feel like sushi; don't miss out and find your way over!",Akakiko
40,"ate there twice in one week; good food choice across the asian cuisine, fast and efficent service, great atmosphere.",Akakiko
40,"Akakiko has change location from down town to Engomi. Parking could be a problem at busy times. The Hilton hotel next door has parking.The open plan is inviting and adds to the ambiance. The activities in the kitchen are visible for all to see. Through the glass partition. We had booked a table and were briskly seated. Upon which time we dived into the starters. No complaints there, all starters were efficiently consumed. The seaweed salad was new to me, I would recommend it. The seafood soup got the thumbs up too.The offering on main coarse range from Bento Boxes to sushi. You are spoiled for choice . All our dishes were well presented, the food was good.I shared a creme brûlée, to finish off.The mojioto could have been better, at €6 a pop I expect fresh limes. The only other issue, was the scattering of the waiters. I am used to one waiter serving me in an evening. A little confusion , and waving arms.I had a look at express lunch menu , it looked good.All round a good evening. So if you are in Nicosia try Akakiko",Akakiko
40,This place has been getting better as the years go by. They change their menu regularly and every time have managed to come out with some new things that are really tasty. Service and prices are good and you will certainly enjoy your meal here.,Akakiko
50,Delicious food and attractive environment! Great service and friendly staff! Totally recommend it and I will definitely be going there again!!,Akakiko
50,"A very good restaurant with flavors from asia, very well cooked , great diversity in the menu, good atmosphere, but book a table before you go. Nicosia has very good restaurants, akakiko is one of them.",Akakiko
40,Akakiko is one of the places that never disappoints you. considering that the place was crowded the service was fast.i like the introduction of new dishes and their new catalog that makes it easy to select the dish of your choice.the food is always fresh and the variety is large.what i didnt like was the fried ice-cream (although some people finds it wonderful) but this depends on each person experience.reccomended!,Akakiko
50,"Been to Akakiko few months ago invited by friends for lunch. I really liked it but i didn't make a review about it as i did not have any control of the meal. Went again last night with my wife and two sons to celebrate my young son's 19th birthday. The food was fantastic. Salads, makis, sashimi, hot dishes and deserts were of very high standard and served the right time. Service was fantastic as also the atmosphere. You can't call it a high class restaurant but that is not the point when you want to enjoy a good time out. Most importantly their prices were very very good.I would go again the next time i am in Nicosia.",Akakiko
50,"If you want a great value excellent meal, go here and try the €7.50 meal special. Really good tasty food and for the price it can't be beaten.",Akakiko
40,"Very busy, obviously the 'in' place. Were seated at bar counter, but was a high counter. Food good. Not very romantic!! Quite rushed.",Akakiko
20,"We used to go to Akakiko or take away food quite often in the last. It was the first time we visited the new Akakiko. Nice place, quite modern, easy to reach, park etc.Service is quite good but not on busy nights. During popular Friday Saturday nights the place loses its food quality, gets too noisy and dinner is not fun anymore.Food is really poor. I don't know what has changed and why food now tastes bad.Badly cooked starters and really flat mains. We even hated the noodles...Food is really overpriced for no apparent reason. Even vegetable dishes are quite pricey.Not going back for sure. Really disappointed that the relocation has changed Akakiko to the worse. Used to be a favorite, we used to enjoy sushi, Maki and food there. Not any more.",Akakiko
30,"A nice asian fusion restaurant, however way too crowded.Food was nice, and so where the starters, though sushi is overpriced. Decor is wonderful but the place was very noisy, due to the fact it was overcrowded.The staff were kind, however there was a mixup with our order and as a result, a sushi entree was served as a starter and another starter was served with 10 minutes delay. Mains took quite some time to get served, but thats understanding, considering that the restaurant was filled to the brim.Will visit again, but definately not on a weekend...",Akakiko
40,"Lovely food especially the maki dishes, but quit expensive . the avocado chicken salad is great and try the california crunchy maki you will love it",Akakiko
50,"We went for dinner on a friday night and this was my first time at the new Akakiko. The waiters were very kind as soon as we stepped inside. The decor is very modern with a relaxing atmosphere. By 9 o'clock all tables were full, so you must make a reservation in advance. We ordered a selection of maki rolls (very tasty and fresh), the pop corn prawns (excellent choice), a salad with prawns (nice & spicy) and the chicken tempura (lovely). It was a nice surprise that food arrived on the table really quick, and the fact that all dishes were really good! Prices are reasonable as well. Probably the best japanese restaurant in nicosia.",Akakiko
50,"very good and quality restaurant, reasonable prices, lovely atmosphere, modern decoration, very polite personnel",Akakiko
50,"Very good service and good food. Recommend to anyone that favors sushi and Asian cuisine. Value value for money, located @ the Hilton Park Hotel. Comfortable chairs, nice atmoshere.",Akakiko
20,"On arrival we were seated at a table which had very strong lights aiming at us. On asking the waiter to find us another table, he laughed and said that the restaurant was fully booked and no other table could be found, although at the time it was less than half full.Ordered our set meals plus octopus and soft shell crab sushi.Instead of octopus they served us cuttlefish sushi, and soft shell crab was the cheapest kind of frozen Chinese crab legs found in the market which in no way can be eaten with the shell.On making a comment to the waiter, first for the octopus, he said that i had made a mistake in my order, although he did not had the order in hand to show it to me.Regarding the soft shell crab which was very hard and could not be chewed, he suggested smiling that was the proper soft shell crab and not what I knew up to now.I asked then to see someone in charge, he left and had a chat with a man behind a counter and both looked at me and laughed.After 15 minutes of waiting, just left the place and send a letter to the management,Still waiting for their reply 20 days later.",Akakiko
50,"Just spend a dinner with family last month. Very good service and good food. Recommend to anyone. Its value for money, located by the Hilton Park Hotel. Comfortable chairs, with trendy ambience. Well done, the management and staff deserve our valuable commends.",Akakiko
40,"Went for lunch with the family. There was a bit of a delay from the kitchen with the main courses, some starters were obviously not freshly made but, all in all, we had a pretty good experience. Prices were more or less as we expected.",Akakiko
40,We went there for lunch and it was very nice. There were some Special offer menus and we took them. Very nicely cooked meal and very good for the price/value ratio (that was the Special price menu),Akakiko
30,"I ve visited this restaurant after hearing much about it and thought it would have been excellent! Although the menu was rather exciting in content, with a great variety of dishes, all the rest were just ok. We ordered both sushi and oriental dishes so we got the chance to try a bit of all categories, but no excitement in terms of taste! Everything just average with nice presentations.Service was okeish too, with kind staff but disorganised as we ordered a bottle of water to 4 different people and took them more than 15 minutes to bring it!!The dessert menu had a couple of choices, we ordered chocolate bites with coconut rice which gets excellent for presentation and creativity but in terms of taste was a bit plain.In terms of decoration the restaurant reminds nothing of asian/oriental as the decor is rather plain and mixed up! Some work is needed there.Give some more effort management people!",Akakiko
50,Very nice restaurant. The staff is very friendly. The sushi is perfect and served with nice decoration. The prices are normal. We will visit this place again very soon.,Akakiko
30,"After 45 minutes of waiting for the starters (medium sushi platter and edamame) and a comment for the delay with no apology, the experience has as follow.Large sushi pieces (but of good quality), overcooked edamame and below average main coursesNot a place that I would reccommend for main course, just sushi and drinks",Akakiko
10,"Wow, an award of excellence. They must be going cheap these days. I visited Akakiko for my birthday with a group of friends based on the recent huge advertising campaign for this place and other oriental restaurants being fully booked. When we arrived we had to actively encourage the service to find our reservation as they stood at the till talking, or just kept walking past us. Once seated we again had to ask for the menus after sitting there for roughly 20 minutes. When the food arrived, the starter platter of sushi was plentiful but I experienced something that I had never before seen (or smelled) anywhere. I don't eat sushi myself but my circle does, and it has never stunk before and I don't think that is normal. For myself I ordered various dumplings, one of which was supposed to be lobster. Either they were the blandest lobster I ever had (and I'm big on the lob) or they were a faux-lobster made of blended crab sticks with prawns. When the mains arrived most seemed to be quite bland and were not adequately hot (as in temperature, not spice). My plate of beef with broccoli was served in the water run-off of the meat and the broccoli was a foul frozen and boiled mess which retained the broth in the head and tasted like.. well I'll just say disgusting. Any beef was rump or a poor selection of tough meat and not suitable for stir fry. It was supposed to be a wok stir fry which I can make in two minutes at home for 5 euros with fresh ingredients, rather than a horrible mess of cold, yet melting vegetables and sparse and tough meat. The white wine we ordered was warm, the staff did not serve it, and at the end of the night, we practically had to beg for the check from the two girls, yet again, gossiping at the till. The best part of the evening was my cake, which we brought from a fantastic local bakery. Oh, and people were allowed to smoke indoors, which is against the law but the management clearly does not care. Avoid like rotting fish.",Akakiko
50,"We failed to make a reservation, but they found a space for two of us. The food was of a high standard, with some interesting interpretations of some dishes. The chefs were all filipino with an open kitchen view.",Akakiko
50,"Akakiko is one of the restaurants that we visiting very often. The food is great, the service very good and the atmosphere is perfect. The prices are a bit high but they offer good quality of food. You can choice anything you want from menu from Sushi to simple plates. Suitable for families, couples etc",Akakiko
20,"Nice exterior, cleanish interior, new furniture, bright pseudo feng Sui decor and that's about it. Food very average, more or less the same student quality as the previous store when located in Makariou Ave. Price expensive for what you get. I would stick to Wagamama anytime for this type of experIence. Saved the best for last. Our order came 50 minutes after ordering+They managed to bring 2 out 6 orders wrong.Had to wait for 25 minutes before they brought correct order.YOu want icing on cake? The waiter left the wrong order which was noodles with prawns on the table and told us to eat that too. what are we obese elephants? Anyway finding a piece of Brillo pad attached on one prawn didn't make things better. Needless to say the manager was more interested in posing for beautiful customers than doing his job. Paid. Left. Good luck Akakiko.not.",Akakiko
50,Great food and service; civilized environment. Nice selection of wines. A bit expensive but not so for the oriental taste lovers.,Akakiko
40,You will need a reservation as this place gets busy! You will get full with 2 sushi dishes therefore the main course will be more than enough. Prices are average to high. Quality is good. Try the new dishes. Loved it!,Akakiko
20,"One of the first restaurants I ever tried in Nicosia. It was truly moderate at best. The food was not bad at all, the sushi is not inventive at all, but passable. The spring rolls were pretty good. The sesame chicken I did not enjoy though, although I usually enjoy that type of meal. But the chicken was pretty dry. They offer lunch deals, but they are not as appealing as I'd hoped. I'd have preferred better deals on sushi, which I didn't feel they offered. The service was painfully slow. The prices were pretty high as well, even the meal wasn't all that impressive. The menu is very varied and packed though, for those who like lots of options. The seating and atmosphere are also commendable. For me though, there are better value-for-money option available for a sushi meal.",Akakiko
20,"This restaurant is a new place in Engomi Nicosia. We liked it from the outside, so we decided to go inside as well. We order sushi, as a big fan of sushi myself. The rice was smelly, and you couldn't even chew the sea weed. As for the value? Expensive, and can't understand the reason.",Akakiko
50,Lovely meal there with very good service and friendly staff. The price was very reasonable and the staff very friendly. The only minus was the tiny table for 2 although must admit didn't feel too squashed as there was a side table. 10/10,Akakiko
40,"The new place in Engomi is a huge improvement from the old place Akakiko used to be, especially due to the atmosphere. Food was excelent, even though it took quite a while to get served (waited for over 20 mins for the starters). Prices are very good for the main courses, however I found them a little overpriced for sushi. Of course there is the sushi boat, but if you want to eat a nice sushi roll, you have to pay about 12 to 13 euros for 8 pieces of maki.All in all, a great meal, would get 5 out of 5 if the service was faster and the sushi prices were a little lower. Greatly recommended for the perfect main courses.",Akakiko
50,Situated in the Hilton Park. Food and service excellent. Nice ambience. Very extensive menu. Well worth a visit.,Akakiko
30,"Nice atmosphere but the food is not that great,dim sum was a huge dissapointment and sushi was average.Also too expensive, paid 45 euros for 2 with just water which was 3 euros by the way.",Akakiko
40,"We went there for lunch and ordered 5 dishes thinking from the sizes in the photos that will be small. The food turned out to be too much for 3 people! We had just water and refreshments and the bill (inc the amex discount of 15%) turned out to be 35,70. The ingredients were fresh and the cooking standards quite high for this price. I would recommend it especially for lunch with the offers they have now!",Akakiko
40,"I wrote a post on my blog specifically about our consecutive two-day lunch at Akakiko in Cyprus, which you can view from the link below (with photos):http://hometownbetty.com/more-celebrations-at-akakiko-restaurant-in-cyprus/---------We had to back-to-back lunches on two consecutive outings at Akakiko Restaurant in Cyprus.First Lunch DateThe first lunch date was with a couple of friends who recommended Akakiko. We dined without the kids, which was our first double date in Cyprus! (I think Prof and I should do these more often.)Our friend told us that a Korean who lives in Austria owns the Akakiko restaurant franchise, but someone in Cyprus brought the franchise here. Our friends are frequent patrons of this place, and we were treated like kings and queens at lunch.They offered several things on the house. It first began with jasmine and green tea served in clear teapots and teacups. The hot tea was a flavorful blend, which reminded me of my college years when I could fully appreciate tea drinking.The server brought another dish on the house – four bowls of miso soup. The miso soup had seaweed, sliced green onions, and tiny cubes of tofu mixed together. Knowing how much our kids enjoy miso soup, they would have devoured all four bowls if they were at lunch with us.We each ordered a plethora of bento boxes and hot dishes that satisfied our appetites.(Photos Above: Bento box with Bulgogi, Hot and spicy chicken (with go-chu-jang sauce), and Chicken with sesame seeds. Can you see Korean-themed elements in Akakiko’s food?)And when things couldn’t get any better, I received a dessert we split in celebration of my birthday.Second Lunch DateThen the following day, we made plans to eat lunch with another family from Piano Man’s school. Our friend suggested Akakiko for lunch, not knowing that we had already eaten there. Because Piano Man wished to dine at Akakiko, it was a natural fit to eat there for a second day in a row.Our friend ordered several amazing dishes and a huge sushi/sashimi/cali roll boat platter. There was enough food to feed the masses, so we ate until we could not eat another bite.Our friend’s hubby made it out to lunch for a quick bite from a busy day at the office, and we thoroughly enjoyed spending more time with them. They truly know how to enjoy life to the fullest. We talked about Indian, Korean and American culture, food, and everything in between. While I would have to say we ate more hot foods on our first visit, the second visit was about eating colder dishes like sushi and sashimi.I don’t eat sushi or sashimi, since I like my food cooked until it’s burned to a crisp, but our friend encouraged me to try it. It turned out to be pretty good, not too fishy or gooey as I would have imagined, but I think I still prefer my food cooked through.Our RecommendationAkakiko’s menu is filled with pages and pages of dishes. You could eat a different dish every night of the week and say you’ve never tried every dish on the menu. I wouldn’t recommend trying every dish on the menu because your waistline (and mine) would expand as far east and west of this side of the Mediterranean.I am pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant where you can eat some Korean food in Cyprus. We thought we would only be eating Korean food at home. And remember earlier when I mentioned that our friend said a Korean started the Akakiko franchise in Austria? If you know anything about how many of the Japanese restaurants are run in the U.S., you know or will find out that many of those Japanese restaurants are owned and run by Koreans. So it wasn’t all that surprising to know that Akakiko has many Korean flavors aded to their dishes. Just a little food for thought.By the way, after reading some reviews on Tripadvisor, there are mixed reviews about Akakiko. Some say the sushi/sashimi is frozen, which Prof said was true. Others have also said they ordered sushi for delivery, which turned out to be a horrible experience for them, but that just sounds like a bad idea to me. I don’t think any restaurant would be willing to give substantial proportions for take-out or delivery when they much rather you dine-in, at least that’s been our experience at some Japanese restaurants in the States. However, if you’re in Cyprus and have a hankering for Japanese food with a little Korean influence, then Akakiko is the place for you. Just remember to dine-in at Akakiko.We wished we had known about this place sooner in our journey in Cyprus. Wagamama is still a favorite in our household, but we have now added a new favorite Asian restaurant to our mix. Check out other excellent Asian restaurants in Cyprus on the Food Page on the The Seoul of Cyprus, if you get a chance, to make your choice for favorite Asian restaurants in Cyprus!",Akakiko
50,"Since moving to the new location in Engomi; near the Hilton Park, the Restaurant became a friendlier and relaxing place to enjoy lunch or dinner. The reception and service has improved because of the new open space.The menu is huge with a great variety of Suchi, Maki, and Sashimi, Soups, Warm Dishes, and Deserts; if you feel confused; the best solution is to select the full Bento Meal; you will get a share of everything.The Rib – Eye Roll with Mushrooms Teppan was superb, and the Eight Treasures with Black Bean Sauce was fine too, but the Fried Ice Cream with Strawberry Sauce was out of this world, delicious and well presented; huge size for just € 3.50. I will certainly go again to Akakiko to have another Fried Ice Cream.Prices are very reasonable compared to Quality and Size.",Akakiko
50,This restaurant is a brand new addition and is part of Hilton Park Hotel in Nicosia.The restaurant is very nice and the food is fantastic.I went there for a business dinner and ordered a large variety platter of sushi.We were presented with 76 pieces of sushi served in a large boat which was placed in the middle of the table. This accompanied with a great French white wine was the perfect end to a long meeting.I think next time you want to have sushi make sure you try the Akakiko in Hilton Park.,Akakiko
50,"If you want good sushi, simple.....go here. You wont find any better in Cyprus. Avoid Sushi LA, it is low end and doesnt even compare. Sushi LA has a buffet, in the sushi world if the restaurant offers a buffet you should usually look elsewhere. The dishes and variety at Akakiko are plentiful and flavourful. the variety is crazy. check it out. waiting for the one in Engomi to open up!",Akakiko
20,"We had ordered delivery from Akakiko, Nicosia for Valentine's day for the whole family. We knew the food was expensive but we expected that the quality would be at least comparable. We were disappointed to find out a much lower quality in the food, especially the raw fish. It was clear that the fish was old and frozen and they defrosted it, not to mention the smell. I would not recommend it!",Akakiko
50,"this is an value for money restaurant for casual and semi-casual night out. you can enjoy various and different type of sushi, maki and other japanesse tastes.absolutely reccomended!!",Akakiko
40,The best Japanese restaurant in Nicosia but not the most expensive. It has been around for many years and that is because of its good steady quality and wide menu. Dont miss the vegetable tempura. Not very fond of their desserts. They deliver as well and it comes in suitable package. Web order for the delivery and iphone and android app,Akakiko
50,"Very nice food,love the new menu and very good service!!! It has become one of my favorite restaurants in Nicosia!!! Sushi is not the cheapest food to have, but value for price is very reasonable!!!",Akakiko
40,"everything is nice, big variety, even bentos out for takeaways..only issue: they use wrong soya sause for sushi and sashimi... really, with that nice and costly place, they should really import the right soya sause from japan (yes, there is a special soya sause for it... noone in cyprus has it usually, and its a pitty as it makes a lot of difference once you tried it once - and i had the luck of doing so in my trips to japan)",Akakiko
50,The food was excellent The down side sushi pieces are extremely large The soup was nice and spicy as i like it Service was good and food was brought at a rimely fashion,Akakiko
30,"We visit Akakiko very offten coz we love sushi but last time we went was a total dissappointment and will be our last. We went early, ordered a starter, all great. The main dish, although the prices havent changed, was poor and the quantity was allot less.The thing that really pissed me off was when we gave the money to pay the bill, we were waiting 45 mins for the waiterss to return €0.80 as change.We even asked her twice for the change and it still took them 45 mins to bring the change!!Will never ever go there again!!",Akakiko
50,I advise Akakiko anyone visiting Cyprus or living in Cyprus. Great food great service with fair price.,Akakiko
30,"I am a frequent visitor of Akakiko. The last time I visited, though, proved to be the last!! We arrived fairly early, around 7.30, and we were the only table of two besides another table inside. The two waitresses were actually playing with the computer and we had to call them to take our order!!! Also, it would be nice when you order water for the waiter/waitress to actually tell you that you have the choice of whether to order local bottled water or imported water rather than assuming you would prefer the imported bottled priced at EUR4 per bottle!!! Our starter of kamo maki was very good, as always... But the sesame chicken was a tragedy!!! Although, Akakiko has not increased its prices, the quantity in each dish has reduced. The sesame chicken lacked taste and was just thrown on the plate with no sauce on top, although it was on the side. Generally, I did not enjoy my meal... Probably the last time I visit!!",Akakiko
50,"I have been a weekly customer of Akakiko for many years, always finding the food to be fresh and cooked to perfection. The selection of sushi, maki and sashimi is excellent and at reasonable prices. Although I am more of a sushi person, I have been recommended some warm dishes on some occasions and the taste is unique. The Korean chicken is to die for!I am quite surprised with some of the comments below as I have never had an issue with the service or the quality of food. Yes, Makarios Avenue no longer has the hype it used to, but Akakiko is the reason I keep coming back.Keep up the good work!",Akakiko
30,"I used to like going to Akakiko. When the weather gets too hot in Nicosia and heavier food just doesn't help the situation, Japanese cuisine offers a lighter more digestible and certainly healthier option. The restaurant itself was part of a complex that at various times included as varied a selection of venues as an Italian restaurant and a Nordsee fast-food franchise as well as the Cafe on the ground floor. Finding a table at any of these establishments was a feat and the atmosphere was busy and trendy.Sadly both the other sections are now closed down and the place seems neglected. The once buzzing Cafe is now empty. This may have nothing to do with the quality of catering at these places but with the fashionable crowd moving away from Makarios Avenue.Akakiko manages to survive, but just. Both in terms of customer numbers as well as, sadly, culinary adequacy.The dishes are the same as before but there is a lack of attention to detail which makes all the gastronomic difference. The tired air of neglect that besets the complex seems to permeate the food preparation as well. The rice base of sushi or tempura for example should hold fast without loosing its moisture. Crispy dry rice and rice that falls apart is not unusual here. The salads need freshening up too. What is unforgivable is the preparation of cooked shrimps. I believe it is a crime to split a shrimp along its spine before squashing it on a grill.What makes up for the average to bad food is the friendly, efficient and wiling service.I really wonder why there is this almost universal lack of interest in how gastronomy is changing in the rest of the world including the countries of origin of the various ethnic restaurants in Nicosia. One can choose to ignore how imagination, creativity, innovation can inform the classic cuisine of every nation, but only when one has mastered the basics. Otherwise mediocrity is the inevitable outcome.",Akakiko
40,"Nothing better at the price for sushi in Nicosia,food is fresh the service always quick and with a smile.",Akakiko
40,"I have been to Akakiko before with friends but this was our first family visit there. My two children were excited to try 'raw fish' but they and I should say me, were not so happy at the end ... The service was a little bit slow although the restaurant was not full and the presentation of the plates could have been better. The prices are reasonable for a sushi restaurant, except the wine which is quite expensive.",Akakiko
30,"I was very much looking forward to my evening meal out with my friends. Akakiko offered a pleasant environment for us, but, for the first time, the service was quite poor.I should say the evening did not start this way as the waiters were very keen to tale our order. However as the evening progressed, the waiters noticeably reduced in number and the service worsened. A delayed main course was followed by the bill being directly delivered to our table without us even asking for it. And this, before we were offered dessert and coffee! We felt almost like we were almost shooed out.So poor service overall, but the food that did come when it did, really was very good - so thankfully they at least got that part right!",Akakiko
30,"I have been to Akakiko several times but my last time proves that you cannot count on this place to be reliably good. I am all for giving a place second and third chances but the haphazardness of the quality of service must be noted as it ranges from excellent to very bad and everything in between. The food is good, nothing stellar but decent if you do not have many expectations for a sushi place in a taste and experience- wise super-conservative country. The prices are ok -- we paid 25 euros per person (group of 4) for a shared starter plate, main dish and one bottle of wine. It is not great but everything is overpriced in Cyprus so I am noting this in context. The location is also good as it is very central and there is plenty of parking. The outside part is also nice in the summer-- it is cosy and the feeling of being on top of a building adds atmosphere-- although it could seriously use some fans on a hot and humid night, which are the majority of summer nights in Nicosia. Where this place seriously lacks is the quality of service. The staff is nice but, even if one excuses their not knowing Greek, it is hard to excuse their lack of knoweldge about the dishes. They were willing to find out of course but we got the feeling that they just did not want to be there and we simply created trouble for them. We had to ask for water several times, they kept forgetting to bring it. and the extra ginger we ordered never came. Then, while waiting for someone to come and ask us about coffee and dessert, we simply got the bill (!) even though we did not ask for it! This really cut our night out short.",Akakiko
30,"Went to have dinner there outside with friends. Have to admit that the taste of the food was good. Besides that, there was inadequate ventilation so we were sweating, the service was terribly slow and they forgot to ask us if we wanted desert or any coffee/tea/additional drinks after dinner. Even durinf dinner they forgot to bring us the additional things we ordered/requested. Theybasically forgot us for long preiods of time during the evening. Then they came an hunded us the bill without asking whteher we wanted or needed anything. the cost was on the high side of what is advertised on trip advisor Euro 25, immagine if we had anything beides dinner.",Akakiko
40,"we visited Akakiko a few nights ago which is located in central nicosia. It is a value for money restaurant, no doubt about it.you will taste quite tasty sushi, at reasonable prices. The atmosphere is also very nice.service is also good, but there was a delay at the end, cleaning the table.overall, this is a very good restaurant to enjoy sushi, in reasonable prices.",Akakiko
40,"It is located in central Nicosia and easy to find.The food is excellent! There is a great variety of plates, especially sushi! If u are a sushi-lover u'll appreciate this restaurant.The prices are normal, as long as u know what to order.The atmosphere is ideal for couples but also friends groups.Some times the service is not in its best, but u can't have it all!!I will definitely go again!!!",Akakiko
50,"Fantastic sushi with great value for money, and I feel it is not appreciated enough. It also has online ordering system and delivery all around Nicosia. Its location right in the centre of Makarios Ave (one of the busiest streets in Nicosia) is fantastic.",Akakiko
20,"I have been to Akakiko for many times past three years and I always got good service and nice food. However I believe since last year the quality of their warm dishes have changed for worse. I had vegetable udon soup last was tasteless which made the noodles taste bad (broth is very important in Asian kitchen which shows the skills of the chef and it is used as a base for making other sauces) and the taste was nothing like previous rich sweet taste I had so many times before in this restaurant. The most shocking thing was that the vegetables were not cut with a knife but they were grated. Different cutting techniques result in different taste and texture of vegetable. Mine were over cooked in the soup because of the way they were grated.The biggest disappointment was when I ordered mochi and they actually reduced the portion of mochi (since last month) by putting some extra fruit slices in. They did this by cleverly cutting mochi into two which also ruined the sweet because no chef would dare to ruin appearance and taste of this sweet by cutting it like that for you.This is a fancy restaurant and I expect to get food that is up to the standards I am paying for. Sadly I must stop going there and certainly cannot take any of my clients for dinner there because I cannot trust to eat a complex dish like sushi, which seriously depends on the cutting techniques and quality of the product, in a restaurant where they cannot make simple broth or cut vegetables properly, in addition to this it is offensive to try fooling the customer by secretly reducing the portions.",Akakiko
50,If you want sushi just go there! The best sushi restaurant in Cyprus!,Akakiko
40,Good Japanese food reasonably priced. Nce verandah when the weather is fine. The waiters are very helpful.,Akakiko
50,"Been there a thousand times and ordered for take away another thousand. Great food, large portions, great service, great prices. Very cosy and warm place especially for winter nights",Akakiko
40,About Akakiko is not much to say. Is a good down to earth sushi restaurant.Most of the Maki- Rolls a very good although nothing crazy and amazing in terms of sushi creations.You get fresh sashimi and sushi as well as Asian hot dishes.I come here very often to kill my sushi cravings and it is really OK. Of course don’t expect sushi like hakkasan style. I would compare it more like the wagamama for sushi.My opinion: Good value for money and down to earth sushi.,Akakiko
40,"I have eaten at Akakiko over 20 times the last few years. That statement should say it all - the fact that i keep going back with friends as well as family is a big vote of confidence for thos place.The Sushi is always fresh and well prepared. Other items on the menu are excellent.My only gripe is the service, on my last visit 3 weeks ago, we had to continually look for the waiting staff, service in a restaurant is not just about fropping the food on the table and leaving, its about service and selling. One of my friends on this night is a wine connoisuer and wanted the wine list again sow ecould order more wine and could not find a waiter, in the end we decided not to bother. Message to Louis Group - 'spend a little on staff training'Overall though Akakiko is very good and the prices are reasonable. A must if you like Sushi. Damage for the night 120 euro for four people with a bottle of wine.",Akakiko
40,"Many options for food, from sushi to asian dishes. Sushi is ok, not wow but quite tasty. The dishes are really tasty, fresh ingredients and reviving! Nice atmosphere, and fast staff.",Akakiko
40,"I visited this restaurant several times, with both my partner and my girlfriends. It is great for a girls' night out as they do nice cocktails and offer value for money sushi. Also, it has a great variety of non-sushi food for those who don't like raw fish. Nice atmosphere, not too snobby but quite relaxed. Would recommend it either for lunch or dinner.",Akakiko
50,Same standard of quality every time.Sushi always fresh.Very good price comparing with other sushi restaurants.Excellent service.Just excelletn,Akakiko
50,the place is very nice - you should go in formal clothes. the food is very delicius,Akakiko
40,"I was hesitating how to rate this place, if I consider it a restaurant, I would only give average, but when it comes to a chain/fast food/delivery it is very good. I only went there once, I order from there at least twice a month. The food is good, their sushi is fresh and acceptable level, they are open on Sunday during a day and that makes it perfect when you are lazy, during the week they have a lunch offer that I often take advantage of, I would definitely recommend it, just bearing in mind, not to expect an unforgettable experience.",Akakiko
40,Nice place.standards are the same everytime u go.noce fresh sushi good price.menue needs some new entriea and a renovations to make it more exciting!,Akakiko
50,Contemporary nice stilish restaurant... ideal for lunch especially! Great salads!,Akakiko
30,"I have to admit, the food was really good but the management should really look into the service. We were a group of 4 and due to some mistake made in the order, we ended up eating two at a time. Also we found it hard finding a waiter / waitress most of the time.",Akakiko
