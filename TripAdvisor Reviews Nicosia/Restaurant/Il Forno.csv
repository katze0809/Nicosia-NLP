50,"We had lunch here in early February. Service and food were excellent, despite the restaurant being very busy.",Il Forno
50,"We went for Sunday lunch to Il Forno, with no reservations. The only requirement was, that we wanted to sit indoors. That was due to the 3 children we had with us. More like babies, all under 3. We were 4 adults, 3 children and 3 strollers to accommodate. The staff there were very helpful. They arranged the tables, and stored the strollers to make space.The food was also amazing. The pasta for the kids came promptly, so the hungry kids could start eating. Our pizzas, lasagna and calzone all came a bit later. All great, in taste and size. Their stove oven gives their food an extra flavour and quality. Highly recommended!",Il Forno
40,"This place is always packed so try to make a reservation or just before strolling in ledras street pass by and ensure that a table will be reserved for you . Excellent Italian type pizzas, oven - baked. Pasta comes in huge hefty portions. Salad freshly cut . The tables are outside in the street and this makes it easy eating but sooo tasty. Wine reasonably priced, served chilled. Prices are really good for an excellent quality good. No wonder this restaurant is always packed",Il Forno
40,Lovely setting on Ledra street. We returned having been here in 2009.We went there for a pizza after a long day walking the green line UN buffer zone and exploring the delights of Nicosia.Great for people watching. Good pizza selection. I would only suggest they put the pizza in the roof of the oven for a few seconds prior to serving to brown off the top slightly. Otherwise it was lovely.Would go back again,Il Forno

Okay, we paid for it the night before but even leftover, their food was good.",Il Forno

50,Visited today for sunday lunch. Left with the best of impressions. Would highly recommend to anyone. Pasta was delicious. Ordered quattro formaggi with extra bacon and it was sooooooo good and well sized portion. Price was reasonable also at 13 euro. Wife had her favorite dish with shrimps and loved it. Kids dishes was very large could have ordered 2 instead of 3 as a lot was left and they ate very well 2/3 portion for the kids. Big respect to the owner. Saw him waiting tables and cleaning them also. Moving chairs and tables around to fit customers. Bravo. Brought me a keo without ordering one and did not charge. Asked us at the end if we wanted coffee or sweet and as we said no my 5 year old said yes. We insisted and told him no but brought him a delicioys profiterole anyway at no charge and didnt charge the espesso at the end also. Congrats to him. Would definitely come again,Il Forno

40,"Every time I visit Nicosia with my family, this is listed as a ‘must stop’ restaurant for us! I have eaten here about 5 times, each being exceptional. When you are first seated a small plate of snacks are brought to you with olive oil, a nice touch. Usually we order a pizza and pasta, and possibly a salad, which is definitely enough for 4-5 people. Both are cooked perfectly, and all dishes are delicious!My only con is that they do take advantage of tourist prices, around €2.50 for a drink, and about €14 for a pizza!However, as long as the prices don’t get too high, I will happily return!! Highly recommended for dinner!",Il Forno
50,I am very happy with it every single time I am visiting this restaurant and the food is delicious and cheap and it is a good place to choose to eat while in Nicosia,Il Forno

10,"The staff was disrespectfull not as such towards me but anyone who is fasting. A waiter told me what you don't know doesn't hurt you, he has put pork on Indians food without them knowing and they seemed ok, he said. The table next to me as I had sat down, they had just finished and they made a complaint about the cheese she had eaten. She said it had gone off and the waiter said that's what the cheese tastes like, he went into the kitchen and said something is wrong with the cheese.

Ordered a green salad and mozzarella pizza which had oregano, broccoli . Both platters were huge the salad and the pizza so for two people 1 plate of each is more than enough. The taste of both is simply magnificent and the bread used for the pizza is so thin to the extent that you can’t stop. Best choice in Nicosia for italian food. Ordered a diet coke as well as an orange juice. All in all the cost was €28 which is perfect. Check out the food in the photo if you feel like ordering the same. Highly recommend.",Il Forno

40,We had dinner at Il Forno this week after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. Easy to walk past as there is almost no visible signage!! There are only outdoor tables which provide the diner with a ringside seat to the goings on of Ledra Street! The food we chose was excellent. A large green salad followed by spaghetti with pesto and pinenuts and tagliatelle with bacon and mushrooms in a cream sauce. HUGE portions ... we chose 2/3 pasta portions and couldn’t finish!!

50,"We were in Nicosia to check the green line and the borders between Cyprus and Turkey! We found that the streets there are over populated and negatively rated! But once u move far from the borders, the better it is! We asked about a good restaurant to have dinner, they advised me about Il Forno! We chose a table, ordered and 5 minutes later the food was served. We ordered a Pizza with white sauce and feta cheese, it was amazing!

40,"Great location, just in the heart of Nicosia, in Ledras street.This time we try Vezuvio pizza (with chilly), tasty but really too hot. Service is quick, excellent indeed, prices i would say are reasonable, but i think beer is overprised,3.30 euro the small one.",Il Forno
50,"I have enjoyed a number of meals here over the years and have always found the food fantastic. Both the pasta and pizza are king.

50,"I have been going to Il Forno, on and off, for the past 18 years and have never been let down by the food or service, even once! The pizzas and pastas are all delicious and the service always fast. What I really like about this place is that in all these years, unlike most restaurants in Cyprus, each dish always tastes the same as when I first ordered it all those years ago! A delightful experience every time!The only snag about this restaurant, in my opinion, is that it is very small and space is very little. Often, in peak times and seasons, one feels one is sitting on the next person's lap.... (I would still go... the food and service compensate for that!!!!)",Il Forno
40,"We had lunch in the restaurant, ordered Pizza, Pasta and Salad. Pizza was average but ok, nothing special. Pasta was tasty. Salad was large portion. In total good lunch in Nikosia. The location is good on the main street.",Il Forno

50,The best and fastest pasta you can have in town! Excellent food. The pizzas are excellent as well. Definitely recommended for everyone,Il Forno
40,Called for a mid afternoon meal just after arriving in Nicosia. Super clean place in great people watching tourist spot. We ordered a pancetta pizza to share with a bottle of Kaparounda rose. The pizza was very fresh and delicious. The rose was also very good Staff were friendly and attentive but there was a changeover at 5pm and this seemed to cause some disruption with a delay in taking our payment.

30,"Need to step up there game.Staff was friendly and prices was reasonable but food was average.We had ordered 2 different pizzas, they bring our food after 10 minutes (how is that’s possible!)This place supposed to serve Italian food, pasta and pizza, pasta dishes on the next table was looking good but pizzas need improvement.I had recently try a authentic Italian pizza at New York City and definitely was nothing like this.",Il Forno
50,excellent service althought it was full. the pizza and the pasta we had was very nice. and the price of the dishes were normal. i will go again for sure.the only negative that is a manner of personal taste is that the pasta has too much cream.,Il Forno

40,"went here by accident one night and was not disappointed...the portion are very big first off no complaint from me and you can take left overs away as you can with most places. The service is fast with waiters running back and forward at times watching to see if they would collide but have it down to perfection, If you go here in the evening a reservation is recommended with times queues of people waiting on tables. All pizzas and pasta dishes look tasty. Ours being a salad and a pasta dish very tasty and good value.",Il Forno
50,"When i am thinking about pasta lazania or pizza is the first place that is coming in my mind. Tasty pasta bolognese, delicious creamy lazania and 100% traditional italian pizza highly recommended.

50,"Excellent food, reasonable prices, excellent service. George always does his best to make sure the service is always excellent.",Il Forno
40,"Excellent Italian pasta and pizzas in very big portions, in the middle of the pedestrian area of Ledra street.The only disadvantage is that on winter time there is no place to sit inside so you must be really lucky to get table inside.But for those that they don't mind to sit outside is very nice for winter as well.Value for money and I always enjoying to eat at Il Forno.",Il Forno
40,"This place is a stable in Nicosia. Same staff for at least ten years. This speaks a lot about Il forno! Friendly, polite stuff, quick service and tasty food.

50,"If you are a local then you must be at least aware of the long standing Italian ""Il Forno"" at the main street of Old Nicosia, Ledras. If you are a visitor who is in Cyprus for quite a few days and you have already tasted the traditional Cypriot cuisine then perhaps you would like a change. A small, low key place, ""Il Forno"" has been open for at least a decade (as far as I know). It is always busy and in Cyprus that speaks volumes. It is perfect to visit during evening with its tables strewn outside on the cobbled street. The pizzas are a good size and baked with fresh ingredients. Combine that with a good bottle of red and at the end of the evening, you will leave with a smile on your face, having paid reasonable fare for very tasty food.",Il Forno
50,"Best pizza in Nicosia. IL Forno has been around for as long as I can remember. Always the same good service, excellent pizza. Though you seat in the pedestrian area of the old town of Nicosia, the place has been established for so long that everybody enjoyed it and keeps coming back.",Il Forno
50,Simple but tasty fresh Italian food! Great friendly service! Same staff for years but always polite courteous and professional! Always a new dish to try!,Il Forno
50,This Ledra Street based Italian Restaurant has over the years consistently produced high quality food and will never disappoint. A real credit to the owner(s) that have been able to deliver such prompt and efficient service from more or less day one.I am not going to say too much because I have said it all before. You are served with complimentary dough balls and a small bowl of olive oil as a starter. I shared 2 pizzas (Cazareccia/mixed vegetables and Funghi/Mushrooms) and a Penne Formaggi/4 cheese penne and a mountain of green salad with an abundance of Parmesan shavings. All the dishes are of a very generous size and with lots of cheese (perhaps too much to be honest).You really can't fault this place if you want fresh and authentic Italian food. Will continue to visit this Italian Restaurant whenever holidaying on the island and in my opinion consider it to be the best place to eat (whatever your eating preferences) by a long way!!!,Il Forno
50,"Always the same quality.Great pasta , very nice pizza and the salad was fresh.Its a great place to go.I think one of the best in Cyprus.",Il Forno

50,"Simple place, no frills, decent menu and good quality of food. Outside seating at the pedestrian Ledra street, in the heart of old Nicosia. To see and to be seen, especially at weekends. George and Co. are doing a good job, despite the pressure. Reserve in advance if possible.",Il Forno
30,"We visited this restaurant on a week day evening without a reservation. We went early so we found a table. Soon after we arrived it became packed. The staff was polite, but could use a smile. We had pizza, spinach cannelloni and a salad. The portions were big enough, but the food tasted average. All things considered I think it is a bit pricey.",Il Forno
40,"Decent menuVery good foodAuthenticity of some dishes can be challengedFurthest from authentic is the carbonara, prepared with fresh cream instead of just eggsThey do not use parmigiano reggiano, but I never asked for it. Maybe if you ask they will use it.Good valueCrowded at times",Il Forno
50,"It might not look like much on the outside from the street but the food served here is top quality, probably the best pizza I have tasted.",Il Forno
40,"Very central spot, making it hard at times to find an empty table. Pasta is memorable: full of taste, great combination of ingredients, mouth-filling sauces. Pizza could be better; ingredients were not as good and the dough was nothing special. Prices were pretty good for the quality and quantity. Perhaps the best pasta place in town.",Il Forno
40,Stumbled on this place by accident - would recommend. Service slightly slow but food was really tasty - pizza in particular was great. Would recommend for a quick lunch,Il Forno
30,Its a decent restaurant with outdoor sitting in Ledras street. The food is average and the portions are more than satisfying.You can have an ok pasta dish. Its not my go to restaurant when it comes to pasta but ones in a while i will go.,Il Forno
40,"Oven cooked pizzas and delicious salads. I really like the location of the place but unfortunately many times is so packed that becomes annoying, especially during weekends. I recommend visiting the place during the week so you can enjoy better the atmosphere and the food.",Il Forno
40,The restaurant's food is tasteful but it can get really packed and crowded during weekends. Make sure you get a comfortable table.,Il Forno
40,One of the best places that have pasta in Nicosia! My fav is the spagghetti one with zucchini amd prawns,Il Forno
50,"Il forno is one of the best, full-flavoured Italian masterpiece restaurants on the island of Cyprus. It has been around for years and the time alone it's been has proven its potential for tradition on the island.",Il Forno
20,"I have been here long time ago and I was quiet pleased with the food but this time ...I got very disappointed. I have ordered pizza and salad. Pizza was very bad, not tasty at all and quiet salty, the salad was poorly seasoned. A bad experience overall. What happened to them ?",Il Forno
30,Good choice of restaurant. Excellent baked pizza and nice salads especially the one with rokka! Good location and also good prices! Very familiar environment and staff!!,Il Forno
50,Italian food at its best!!! Love the pizza!! You can find various selections to try! And pasta plates are excellent!,Il Forno
40,Il Forno is around for more than a decade. In fact I lost count. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.George the owner is always around keeping a sharp eye on quality and service. Portions are plentiful so if you are not really hungry you can share without any problem.if in doubt about what to order ask for help. the staff will be more than glad to assist.my rating is purposely so in order to keep the pressure for good quality food,Il Forno
40,Delicious pastas & pizzas in the shopping center of Nicosia. It is a small place but with great cousine and wines.,Il Forno
50,"If you are craving for Italian food at affordable price, this is an amazing little restaurant at Ledra street. The food is great, which is why you may need to be patient to find a seat. Perhaps making a reservation may be a good idea, especially on the busy days like Saturday and Sunday.",Il Forno
50,"Excellent food , fast service and average prices not to expensive not to cheap, if you love italian dishes i recommend this particular restaurant which is located in the heart of Nicosia the Capital of Cyprus ,where you can find a variety of pizzas as well as pastas etc. Vegetarian dishes are available, but for vegans options are limited",Il Forno
50,"It's a really good place to go with friends,family and other people. The atmosphere there is amazing also, the food does not take long to come and the food is really delicious. Especially the pizzas are perfect. I go often there and you should also visit it you will pove it.",Il Forno
30,"The restaurant is located in the center of Ledra street in the old town. The tables are actually placed inside this pedestrian street.It's a very busy and noisy place, however, the smell of garlic and sauces attracts the attention of people passing by.Service is fast and the personnel is very efficient.We ordered two pizzas and two pastas. All dishes were very generous. One of the pizzas was great. The other one (Calzone) was burnt on the top. One of the pastas was very good but the other was simply average.Overall it was a good experience. The food is relatively good. But do not expect the quality of a highly rated Italian restaurant.",Il Forno
50,We went there after reading the reviews about the place. The resturant is nice and easy to find. We ordered Vegeterian Cannelloni and Pasta Tagliatelle with pesto sauce. The meals were huge and sooo tasty! The price was also reasnable. Very recommended,Il Forno
50,"We had an excellent meal here - if you like Italian food you will not be disappointed. Two tips - the garlic bread is substantial, we shared one portion and it was plenty as a starter. Also if you order wine by the glass ypu get a quarter bottle - very good value.",Il Forno
40,"We read the reviews on this Italian but unsure of where it was as easy to miss, name not in bold or colour to identify it. The head waiter was very helpful and patient in showing us how the menu worked. The food was very good, busy plus people waiting for a table.",Il Forno
20,We had very nice and polite people servicing us... waiters took service to the next level entertaining our kids while serving and making us feel very comfortable.Pizza was ok.Past was not good... i mean is ok if you are looking for large portions but definitely if you are looking for good pasta with nice sauces etc. then make yourself a favor and order a pizza...,Il Forno
50,"It looks like a ""fast food"" place but I was shocked when I tried the past with salmone, very huge portion and incredible taste. The waiters are very friendly",Il Forno
40,"Went with family and enjoyed the meal. Not sure of the salad though, we ordered a roca salad but several did not enjoy it",Il Forno
50,Been there a few times for lunch and dinner. Very good service and good quality food. Located in one of the most busy streets in Nicosia can be frustrating for some people. I highly recoment it though,Il Forno
50,We have found il Forno on TripAdvisor and we double-checked on Foursquare as well. Following the reviews we found this lovely restaurant in a busy street of Nicosia.

I highly recommend this real italian pizzeria to anybody! I will come back!,Il Forno
40,"Its a very nice place if someone likes italian food. Especially the seafood, is by far one from the most deliscious",Il Forno
30,Nice food and gentle personel but very expensive! It could easily reduce its prices for people... That could be very nice from them because at this point food quality isn't compatible with the price!,Il Forno

40,"Having visited the place countless times in the past 10 years, Il forno is the best choice for a value for money quality italian pasta or pizza in the old city of Nicosia.George who owns the place must be 1 of the most dedicated and inspiring resto owners I have met. Good selection of beer and wine.I recommend the place for anyone who is looking for taste and value.",Il Forno

30,So i went for lunch here on my third day out of pafos.The food was delicious. The staff - we sat for ten minutes before someone came over even with making eye contact.There was one young boy working and his nature was very good. The other workers were speaking in their country language very loud and their attitude completely off. I work in the hospitality industry in Pafos and would never allow my staff to do this.The food was good and good value .,Il Forno
40,"We've been here a few fimes. Small place, better to reserve a table in advance. Very nice pasta and pizza. Large portions and good service.",Il Forno

40,"A nice place for a quick lunch, but as this restaurant is very popular it can be hard to find a table. Most tables are spread on the cobbled street and it's relaxing and warm as it gets some sun during lunch hours. Efficient service and good pasta.",Il Forno

50,Italian style restaurant and nice sitting area outside especially in summer. Delicious pizza in wood fire oven and delicious pasta.,Il Forno
50,We were walking in Ledra street looking for a place to eat when we saw this place. The sizes of the pasta plates on the tables was the first reason we wanted to go in. The portions are really large with very good prices. We got the carbonara and the salmon pasta and they were amazingly delicious.,Il Forno
50,"For more than 10 years now il forno has consistently maintained the no.1 position as the best casual pasta place in town!

50,"Excellent food, excellent prices and excellent service. Is my favourite place where I can enjoy Italian food.",Il Forno

50,The best pasta in town!!!! If you are in Nicosia do visit and try any pasta dish! You can't go wrong!,Il Forno
50,Ansolutely delicious food at this Italian style restaurant. It is one of the best places to ebjoy your pasta or pizza created freshly on the spot. Very quick and friendly service and huge portions. Whenever i go i usually take what's left to go. Excellent prices also,Il Forno
30,"Sunday lunch - 9 of us !! Recommend by my Cyprus friend . After 8 days eating Cyprus food I miss for diffrent kitchen so we choose this place . Food :bread taste like mood , salami from supermarket ...rest was ok . For this price you expect smth wow .No music , service sooo poor ( just took order and that it ) .

20,"poor oily food a bit expensive not too clean found hairs in my plate a lot of times NOT CLEAN FOUND HAIRS IN MY FOOS A LOT OF TIMES NO AMBIENCE , OK SERVICE",Il Forno
50,"We went for lunch at the il forno restaurant in Ledras. Customer friendly, service with a smile. Good quality food, heartwarming. Needs to have at all times salt and pepper on all tables. I like when you can see the chef cooking through a glass. Toilets clean and high standard.",Il Forno
30,"One small pizza 13 euros,1 bottle of water 3 euros,spaghetti 12 euros. No recommend.Anyway the food in Nicosia is not cheap.Why?",Il Forno
50,The food quality and variety hasnt changed for the last 10 years. Amazing quality and variety too. A little bit pricy,Il Forno
40,Nice interior. You can see the pizzas being made right behind the counter. Pizza was nice. Many variants. A tad bit expensive for water as mentioned in the title. For lunch one pizza feeds two.,Il Forno
40,Would go again - social friendly lively and great straightforward food - good for conversations and to watch the city,Il Forno
50,"I have been there many times and I decide to write. Every time that Im going there I m eating linguini with spinach and feta, is amazing! I tried to cook it in my home but I fail! The only disadvantage is that you will not find all the desserts! Highly recommend!",Il Forno
40,"Tasty pasta and pizza, very quick service. Big portions so starers and main dish is a bit too much. A bit expensive though...",Il Forno
50,Are you hungry? Stop over there and enjoy. All the plates are beautiful. Sit and relax in the middle of the street and enjoy a fine cooked meal of pasta with freshly baked bred in a wood oven.,Il Forno
30,"Nice location to sit outside and watch people passing by. The staff was quick and correct, but not too enthusiastic. Food typically Italian, but the tourist kind. No primos or secundos, only pizza/pasta/salads. The pastas were huge portions and well prepared, although nothing special in terms of taste. A bit overprized and a bit overrated.",Il Forno
40,If you are ok with other people walking by you while you are enjoying good food then this is your place! The tastes are good and the location prime.,Il Forno
50,"We visited ""Il Forno"" a few days ago and we were very satisfied. We ordered 3 pizzas, a Bresaola, which was perfect, a Quattro Stagioni, which was very good and a Salami Milano which was just good (the salami itself was not that special and it was not enough). The service was good and the environment as well.",Il Forno
20,Where to start - IL Forno has great italian food - pizza and pasta delicious - what i don't like about the place is the way it's set up - i do however love that you can pop in after a nice stroll on Ledra but...... there is no barrier to prevent people who do walk up and down bumping into your tables and of course having people cough/ or sneeze close to your food... a bit of privacy would make the place so much better in my opinion. I had a bad experience on Friday the public holiday where we were placed outside right where people were coming and going bumping into our table and of course due to the fact that it was busy i can't say that the management understand the need to have a better set up - i've been here a few times and each time even though the food is great i'm left with a sad and disappointing taste in my mouth at the lack of concern the management has to this issue!!,Il Forno
50,"The service and the food is great, it is a must to stop for a bite whilst you are enjoying a stroll down Lidra Street",Il Forno
50,When i am at Nicosia i always go there for food. Its guatantees that you will have good food. The pizzas are delicious and their salads too. You have to taste them!!!!,Il Forno
40,Amazing pasta and pizza. Portions was huge. I couldnt finished my pasta.Plates was fresh and the taste was excellent.Service was really fast and price was logical about 12-13 euros per plate.In the heart of Nicosia.. u can enjoy the city rythm while u have lunch or dinner.,Il Forno
40,"Very nice pasta, with a lot of options and in logical prices (11-12 euros a plate!) Their salad can be ordered in 2/3 size and price also! They have half wine bottles for 10 euros! Food freshly prepared in an open kitchen! Very good and quick service also!",Il Forno
40,"Fast service, ok price, casual style street italian restaurant, really nice salads and pasta! A favourite, I visit it quite often.",Il Forno
40,Very satisfying portions and not extremely pricey. I love the concept of of sitting in an open plan restaurant watching the people passing by.,Il Forno
50,"Met up with a friend I have not seen in years, he suggested this place as he ate there a couple of nights ago. Most of the tables were reserved asked to be seated and they promptly found a spot. The service was very quick and the staff friendly in explaining the options on the menu. The delivery of the food to the table literally took a few minutes, did not have to wait for long at all.The pizza crust was perfect, just crispy enough, we had a vegetarian option with sun dried tomatoes.I shall certainly visit again. Pricing was also reasonable.",Il Forno
40,"In the middle of Ledras street, fine, Italian food as it should be! Not really cheap but not too expensive! People passing by - never getting bored! Great service-no delays!",Il Forno
40,Excellent pasta and pizza and the quality is stable for a long time now. I would appreciate a more confortable sitting area,Il Forno

50,Amazing italian food...better than locals italy food!! It's a must to visit it if you like italian food..but please make your reservation..!!,Il Forno
50,"The structure of the specific business captures 100% the character of the location (busy pedestrian only road - unfortunately very few in Nicosia), as well as the required responsiveness that come with such location. The pace changes rapidly based on a number of factors (weather affects significant the number of pedestrians, waves of tourists especially when organized tours arrive, etc.). The staff is very responsive to this rapidly changing pace, they even seem to enjoy it, and this results in a refreshing and entertaining environment for the visitor. Combined this with the high quality food, a sure choice that I have personally made on many occasions.",Il Forno
30,"12-13 euro for a pasta Napolitana without even using fresh tomatoes. You can't shake the tomato paste flavor no matter how hard you try. My bf ordered seafood pasta, everything was of poor & frozen quality. Small portions as well. Not worth it.",Il Forno
40,Its a good restaurant. It's one of those places that you you rarely go wrong then choosing. Recommended,Il Forno
40,"We went there a couple of times. The food was excellent and the portions plenty. Not enough space to sit though, especially in the winter.",Il Forno
50,It has the best pizza in Nicosia. Very good salads. But the shop is very small. You need to reserve a table to go there.,Il Forno
50,"I've visited this place many times, with family, friends and for business lunches.Pasta and pizzas are amazing.Service is good.Located in the middle of Ledras Street in Old Nicosia, it's great for people watching and is a short walk from bars in case you want to carry on after eating.Only issue is space as it's not very big. Best not to visit during the day in summer unless you want to sweat a lot",Il Forno
40,"Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good but I think its standards have slipped a bit over the last few years. It was once the very best pizza and most like original Italian pizza in Nicosia. Now that accolade goes elsewhere.",Il Forno
50,"This trendy little place has been very popular for years, and obviously there are good reasons for this. The food is great, whatever you order, the portions are quite generous, the service is excellent, and the prices very reasonable. Plus, you get to watch the colourful medley of people of all ages, who walk up and down Ledras street, and hear lots of different languages all around you. Sometimes there is even a busker or two, which adds even more spice to your experience!",Il Forno
50,Have visited many times and tried different pastas & pizzas. Everytime was just perfect! An amazing Italian experience!!,Il Forno
30,"This is a very good Italian restaurant. One of my favourite dishes being the seafood pasta. I also love the ambiance. Unfortunately, as with nearly all cafe style, street restaurants in Nicosia, they take reservations. If a table happens to be unoccupied and not reserved, then, you may use it. On the few occasions when we have eaten there, I have seen potential customers turned away whilst several tables, bearing the 'reserved' sign stand empty. I have travelled a lot and, I have visited many cities. In London, Paris, Rome, Vienna,Amsterdam, Warsaw,Sydney, to name but a few but, NOWHERE have I encountered this practice of table reservations in street cafes. In other cities, we choose a cafe/restaurant and, if a table is free, we are both free and welcome to sit. Because of this unfair practice, my husband and I have stopped frequenting several good restaurants, including this one.",Il Forno
50,I love the food there. Specially pizza. Very polite staff. The only that i dont like is when is full and we are eating out in the pedestrian road. No privacy at all.,Il Forno
50,"Grate, tasty, fresh pasta and the most mouth watering lasagna and canelloni. Fresh ingridients and reasonable prices.",Il Forno
30,"One of the first places that opened the way to the revival of old Nicosia City Center. Originally it offered high quality Italian dishes. Over the years the line has remained the same, the customers kept coming, the tables are usually full, and the inevitable happed: the quality has disappeared.",Il Forno
40,Visited with some friends earlier this month. My friends enjoyed the food and the location is lovely. The staff is friendly although we did have a hickup in the way the waiter was approaching us. However the manager was ready to rectify any mistake and this was much appreciated.,Il Forno
40,"We have visited the place many times.its in the heart of ledras.the one time in th summer was a disaster,we couldnt eat frm there was so many flys,but th food as always is perfect.",Il Forno
40,"We visited the place many times. Good location, tables narrowly, good variety and tasty food. They prepare it in front of you, smells good. Good service. Bit expensive, if tou consider that tou Are eating spaghetti and the plate costs €13 averagely.",Il Forno
40,It was going to be a total five because of the food is delicious! But the people that work there aren't very polite! I recommend it!👍🏻,Il Forno
50,LL Forno is a very nice italian restaurant in Ledra street with a beautiful atmosphere and very good service.,Il Forno
50,"best Italian in town...simple and authentic!!very good service , kind stuff and marvellous dishes !! value for money !!",Il Forno
30,"Good location but the street is dirty and the tables have forever been incompatible with the uneven sidewalk. The prices, for what is offered, are extremely high. Water is expensive. Stopped going because it is too expensive and they don't accept reservations.",Il Forno
40,I liked the food a lot! The choices are limited and the portions are a bit small! I would recommend it for pizza during summer nights!,Il Forno
50,Great menu and place. Excellent pasta dishes and pizza. Quick service and pleasant staff. Must visit once.,Il Forno
40,"Good Italian food for a fairly reasonable/bordering on slightly expensive price. Nice large portions - so if you are not too hungry remember 1 main dish will probably be enough for 2 (particularly if you are ordering pizza or pasta)! Service can get a bit slow during peak lunch hours of say 12pm to 2.30pm when the restaurant gets very busy, but still of a good standard.Not much indoor seating - mostly outdoors on the main Ledras Street in the Old Town of Nicosia. People can sit, eat, chat and watch the world go by!On the whole good wholesome Italian food in a loungy, continental European feel cafe setting.",Il Forno
40,"A very nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Nicosia! Nice pasta, pizza and salad!!! If you like Italian kitchen you should visit it. The prices are ok !!!",Il Forno

50,Il forn is the best place to eat pasta. It has a variety of pasta plates and pizzas. I would recommend pasta with sea food and red wine :),Il Forno
40,We went to Il Forno last night for the first time and we tried pasta.The restaurant is in the heart of old Nicosia and the table is at the walking area. So if you like seeing people walk by this is the place for you. If you don't then it is not.Now in regards of food... Where complimentary bread is concerned this is not a restaurant that offers it so if you are really hungry then order a starter. The main dishes are big in portions but they could have a bit more salt. The prices for a main dishes range from €10-€16. A major drawback is that they have no chicken-pasta dishes.In general it is an acceptable place to dine.,Il Forno
40,Excellent quality of pizza and pasta. The staff is very attentive. Fresh and nicely prepared salads. Good wine list.,Il Forno
50,"If you enjoy people watching, it's a great spot. Most of the tables are outside brimming into Ledra This street starts of on the Greek side of the city and finishes on the Turkish side( interesting)Service was fast and pleasant. Oven baked bases with a multitude of pizza options. The salads were generous and fresh.It's simply a nice spot to soak up the old town and very child friendly.",Il Forno
50,"No cars around. If, like me, you don't mind having your lunch or dinner in a walkway with people passing by all the time I highly recommend it. You can combine eating there with a tour of the old city of Nicosia.",Il Forno
50,"Il Forno has been in the area for years serving excellent pasta and pizza. Their selection of salads is also excellent.The waiters are always polite and professional and most days you will also find the owner (Mr Giorgos) there making sure everything is running smoothly.Portions are more than generous, prices are good. So sit back, have a beer (or some wine) with your pasta/pizza and relax while enjoying the environment of old town Nicosia.",Il Forno
40,"good service, very good food, nice place easy to access and find it .you have many choices regarding the food",Il Forno
40,In the center of Ledra street in nicosia a good choice of restaurant if you want to eat pasta and pizza! Big quanties and good quality of food! You have to make a reservation or you can wait there for 10-15min to find a table! Small restaurant with outdoor tables! Good prices !,Il Forno
50,"One of our favorites for over a decade. Amazing pasta dishes, a rich selection of different pastas, cream based sauces and tomato based sauces. Equally good are the handmade thin crust pizzas and the delicious salads. Quick and friendly service. They always bring water for my dog who also loves going there.",Il Forno
40,"The restaurant is located in the city centre of nicosia. A really good place to enjoy Italian dishes. They have big portions ! However, the place is very small and not suitable for large groups.",Il Forno
30,I have been to Italian restaurants before and al forno restaurant is nothing special. The restaurant is very small most of the tables are in the street. Staff were ok and prices of pizza were on the expensive side. The pizza were good but I expected more from an Italian restaurant.,Il Forno
40,"Food is amazing and the personel as well! The only bad thing about it is the food price. You can find an jtalian restaurant on the same road and the same variety and quality of foodfor almost 30% cheaper so if you want to eat in a specific budget, not recomended.

40,"Il Forno is an italian restaurant in the middle of Ledra street, in Nicosia, Cyprus.It serves pizza, pasta, salads, the italian style. It is of a high standard and is very popular. My son and his girl really love it. If someone wants to be sure for a table, a reservation is needed, because the restaurant has a relatively small covered area. This is a disadvantage for a restaurant of its standards, as eating by the side of the crowded road may not be preferred by some costomers, including myself. We visited ""Il Forno"" many times and we consider ourselves good customers. Just to note that everytime we enjoy its menu.",Il Forno
50,"Great pasta dishes with a lot of sauces to choose from, cooked perfectly the Italian way! a lot of pizzas , basic recipies but excellent quality",Il Forno

40,"We are usual customersof Il forno. Highly recommended if you are in the area. Food is nicely cooked and presented. Generous portions of everything and tasty options to choose from. Pizzas and garlic breads are cooked to perfection inside a wood oven.Avoid at all costs prime times such as Friday and Saturday evenings as it is very crowded, the service is not so good and they rush to get rid of you in order to get more tables. Prices are reasonable but a bit on the high end.Overall though, excluding the times where is crowded it's a good choice when in old town. Also a great plus is that is pet friendly. We went there with our dog and we were surprisingly welcomed...they brought us water for the dog and they were very helpful.",Il Forno

Very nice also the generous seafood salad made by very fresh ingredients. My friend enjoyed his pizza. Friendly service. Just a regret for the same poor beer choice ( which you basically found in 90% of the places here ) in the menu. It's seems there's just one supplier working with restaurants all around here !!!

20,"First we had to wait like 35 minutes to get the food.well it's understandable when the restaurant is full you have to wait a bit more longer but some people came later than us and got the food sooner than we did.maybe because they were regular clients but who cares? The sea food salad was one of the worst I have eaten until now.only one shrimp inside the salad and the rest were bad and not fresh squids.the pasta was extremely salty and the only positive thing there was the pizza.one of the best...I suggest to change the name to"" il forno pizza"" and not "" il forno restaurant"".",Il Forno

Best to book a table though, especially if you want a front seat!!",Il Forno

30,This restaurant is in the buzzy area of Lefkosia where sadly places such as KFC & MacDonalds exist. The seating is predominantly outside and it was full when others were not. So perhaps it is my fault to eat in an Italian restaurant in Cyprus but it was the choice of friends. We had to wait - first for a table (which is a good recommendation) and then about 30 minutes ( perhaps longer) for the food to arrive. The portions were very large. The salads were good. The pizzas were just OK. The calzone was also OK and the salad served with it still had grit in it - so poorly washed. The pasta was also just OK. The prices were on the high side. The service was erratic and the first time around we did not get exactly what we ordered but the staff were friendly. So all in all not good value and I would look for an alternative place to eat next time,Il Forno
40,"You can choose from a variety of pasta dishes and you can also have pizza too. The prices are average but you can have very good dishes, its good to book before you go because most of the times is full and you have to wait queue.",Il Forno

The salad with cheese and sundried tomatoes is EXCELLENT, the pizza so and so, but, frankly, the pasta, lasagna etc dishes, not so much. That wouldn't be that much of a problem if it wasn't overpriced, but sadly it is. I'd recommend other Italian restaurants nearby, which aren't as small as this one.",Il Forno
30,"Service is always fine. Staff is friendly and ready to answer any question. You 'll surely feel welcome. There's not much to say about the dishes as they never disappoint me. I choose 3 ""stars"" because there can always be place for improvement. Surprising your supporters with new dishes would be a great idea.",Il Forno

40,"Long time favorite, like to visit it once or twice a month. Tried several pizzas and pastas, have yet to be disappointed. The service is fast, sometimes not the most polite, but always efficient. Favorite dishes are the pasta with the dried porcini mushrooms, and their pizza with pancetta. Salads are ok, a bit light when it comes to dressing. Overall, would recommend to anybody who wants to have Italian while in the area. Expect to pay around €25 for two people.",Il Forno
50,"Visited Il Forno for the first time during a work-related trip and I must say I was very surprised with the quality of the food! Coming from a previous 2 days eating Mezedes (Meze'), it was a big relief to find a venue offering Italian cuisine.We both had pizza and it was cooked to perfection. The crust was crispy but soft. The size is larger than normal and just looking at it, makes you drool!!The place was almost full to the brim and yet the food was served within 5 minutes!The pasta dishes seem to be very good, with large portions for a discreet price.Overall a very good dining experience at this place and I definitely recommend it to visitors passing by this venue.",Il Forno

50,"This is an authentic Italian Restaurant situated in Ledra St, Nicosia - amongst the other little shops and the Ledra Shopping area.We have been visiting this restaurant with other members of the family for a number of years and have to say that the high standard of food has remained consistent. To kick off lunch - you were served with complimentary dough balls and herb olive oil in a little dipping dish. We ordered the Cazareccia and Funghi pizzas which were massive with plentiful fillings and the Calzone Uno which was ginormous. All were tasty and filling, so much so - that there was quite a bit of left overs which we took with us - in takeaway cartons as kindly packaged by the restaurant.The mixed salad (ordered as a side dish) was again massive - served with a nicely balanced dressing - and a generous amount of parmesan shavings. We struggled to finish this as well.We finished lunch with three scoops of ice cream - vanilla, sour cherry yoghurt and watermelon shared amongst three of us. The ice cream was delicious especially the watermelon flavour. The service was very good and the overall standard of the food - excellent. This restaurant is highly recommended and a must visit if you fancy Italian food and something a little different in Cyprus. You certainly will not be disappointed - although some might think it is a bit pricey!!",Il Forno

40,"We passed this restaurant several times while looking for lunch, the food looked good but all the tables were taken (or were 'reserved'). Most of the tables are outside so you can watch the shoppers in Ledra Street go by. There were outdoor heaters although it was warm enough not to need them turned on. The place was busy.We shared a pizza, not the cheapest place to eat but nice quality, we think the pizza was about 13 euros. The salads ordered by diners at another table were huge.Drinks and then the pizza arrived as expected, with pizza knives. The only drawback - tables are close together and people can smoke outside.",Il Forno

Most days you'd need to make a reservation or wait for a while, or alternatively get the food to take away.",Il Forno
40,One of the good Italian restaurants in cyprus. Very tasty pizzas and pasta types and salads. The downside is the place is very small and you cannot enjoy it during winter since the inner seating area is extremely tiny. But the service is good and the food is much recommended.,Il Forno
50,"A colleague and I tried this restaurant based upon TripAdvisor reviews. We located the restaurant, although the name was not very visible. We shared the rocket salad and had a calzone and pasta, respectively. The staff was attentive and the food was fantastic. Portions are very large, so maybe share with and friend/colleague.",Il Forno
50,"Il Forno is the best Italian outside of Italy for your basic and rustic wood-fired pizzas and fresh made-to-demand pastas. The place gets busy, so make sure you book. It is on the famous Ledra Street pedestrian strip in Nicosia old town, so grab a table outside to watch the people pass by. The pizza are great, perfectly crispy and flavoursome. The pastas are generous and fresh - made with real ingredients and are quite memorable. The salads for those avoiding carbs are huge and really make the others jealous!",Il Forno
50,I enjoyed every bite of my pizza and had some of my girlfriend's pasta as well. Great for a relaxing night out.,Il Forno
40,Nice small place which has been in the market for years. The food is simply pizza and pasta menu. If you are gluten intolerant dont go there. The pizza ia very good. Pasta not so much. They also dont offer any wholewheat brown pasta. I wonder if it will ever be offered in Cyprus.,Il Forno
50,The quality of the food is unrivaled. The portions as well. The prices very reasonable and the service impeccable. Does anyone need more than that?,Il Forno
40,The restaurant (one of our favourite) is situated in the middle of Ledra street. It's a place you have to visit as you walk with friends or family at Ledra street! The food is really delicious and the staff is very helpful and friendly! The only bad thing is that there are not a lot of tables (but we anyway always find place)! Love their pasta and their salads and their pizzas!,Il Forno
50,"It's a favourite restaurant of my daughter :) once, we came and the restoraunt was full but the manager asks us to wait and finally find a place for us :) and they remember us and any next time we always find a table. They do care. The food is very Italian and nice :)I recommend it to anyone who misses the Italian food in Cyprus :)",Il Forno
50,"Cosy, delicious, clean and at a convenient location in the middle of Ledras street! Gotta try it! You will love it :)",Il Forno
50,I've been here for dinner twice now and it is great for groups and couples. The service was excellent and friendly. The food was delicious and there is no way you can leave hungry. My tagliatelle was well cooked and full of flavour and the pizza is great as well.,Il Forno
40,Lovely food. A good place to enjoy some decent Italian cuisine with family in an informal atmosphere.,Il Forno
50,Great food and very fresh. I love the Calzone they serve. Situated in the centre of Nicosia you are able to sit and have a good bite to eat and get a piece of the action while you are at it!,Il Forno
30,"the food is good but quite expensive for what they offer in general. Simple, nothing special, place. salads cost minimum €10 and they are full of leafy greens, pastas and pizza are ok, quite standard, some of the wines are more expensive than in regular 'restaurants'. All averagely ok but the prices are more like of an expensive/high-class restaurant.",Il Forno
50,Visited Il Forno many times. It has excellent food and service. The prices are on the low site. Try the pasta and pizza.,Il Forno
50,"Great restaurant!delicious dishes,great service and very reasonable prices!definitely a must go!i would recommend everything on the menu but spaghetti is my favorite..",Il Forno
50,"we ordered their kebab and chicken grilled and yummyTaboula salad and fresh baked Lasagna, so don't miss it :)",Il Forno
40,"Was taken here by son & daughter-in-law who eat here quite frequently. Fast service! We sat outside in bustling Ledra Street! Was warned that the portions are massive, so ordered a half portion of pasta in a creamy sauce with mushrooms & garlic.. Absolutely delicious! We all enjoyed our choices! Cost was reasonable too. Would go again.",Il Forno
30,"Once more in Nicosia ... walking along Ledra Street searching for a ""fast"" dinner ... Nice temperature, I needed a table outside and I got one at "" Il Forno"". A simple dinner : pizza. Pizza seems an easy meal but it's not ! I read in many reviews "" Italian food, Italian taste and so on "" ... Well I did not get pasta so I cannot give my opinion on those dishes, but the pizza dough was far too hard : it can hardly be compared to Italian pizza !!! The rest of the pizza was ok, but not the main ingredient unfortunately. I found this place definitely pricy ... I guess you rather pay for the convenient location than the food selection. Then I would have a suggestion : why to offer always the same beers ... Carlsberg, Heineken, ( Keo ), ecc. ? I think people are really tired to find everywhere the same tasteless staff ... it's high time to add in the menu some selected products from some artisan breweries !",Il Forno
40,"The place is very good and the price as good as the food. It needs renewal...New chairs, tables, bigger place and outside room. The service is fast but the stuff tired and not smiling. The air condition should be better.",Il Forno
30,"place located in the busy walking street of nicosia (Lidra), pizza tastes italian, products are quiet good, friendly staff, prices are not so high",Il Forno
20,"I have been visiting this restaurant since it first opened. Last time we went there we were served cold spaghetti with very cold prawns. There were flies disturbing us continuously. The pesto was not bad but overall it was too crowded (they could remove one or two tables to make the space more breathable). It's become very touristy nowadays. Staff was polite but struggling to cope with the clients. Not the quality it used to be. Avoid, especially on Saturdays and sundays.",Il Forno
40,"I have been visiting this restaurant for a very long time now, the quality of service has become a bit poorer lately but the food is always compensating, good value for money, always leave the restaurant feeling full. Its a shame they dont offer complimentary coffee at least an espresso but again maybe its for the best because this way people just leave after they eat leaving the spAce for the next people waiting to be seated . Nevertheless , its most probably my first choice for pasta eating as i know i will always leAve happy with quality and quality and the best part is that i can get half portion for half cost or take the food take Away!",Il Forno
50,Great pizza with real cheese. Fast service. The pasta is also great. The ingredients used are the key to their success.,Il Forno
50,"i love the salads and the pizzas.. amazing taste!! great location, great service and very friendly staff.. i highly reccomend it.",Il Forno
30,Standard Italian food popular with children. Even though they accept reservations one always has to wait to be seated. Not enough tables for sitting inside.,Il Forno
50,Authentic italian restaurant with excellent quality food and service.Great pizzas and pasta. The sweets are great too.,Il Forno
30,"The food is standard, commercial Italian cuisine. Sometimes the food is better than other times, but it is definitely overpriced!",Il Forno
50,i went there a lot of times.nice italian pasta try the shrimps and brocoli with white sauce its my favourite...fast service.,Il Forno
50,Very delicious spaghetti! If you love Italian restaurant must visit this restaurant. Prices from 12 euros,Il Forno

40,We tryed il fornos pesto pasta and with compination with fresh made salad is samething to blown your mind away! Good job from all of you back and front of the house!,Il Forno
50,"I had a dinner in il forno last night. :) Could be more pleased both with the cuisine and experience. Staff was really helpful, polite and served us with a smile!! I don't know where to start about the cuisine!!! Great amount of food, i mean really huge proportions. I had a pizza margarita! it was really light and delicious! the dove was amazing not too much oil and really crusty! My friend had a pasta with four different cheese!! They asked if she wanted half proportion and it was still a large portion! We were really pleased with everything at IL Forno! If you ever go to Ledra street in Nicosia you should definitely stop by to have a meal at this restaurant!!",Il Forno
20,"We had dinner at Il Forno on a hot Cyprus night. We had booked and sat at what appeared to be the only reserved table only to be moved elsewhere by a brusque waiter. We were given menus and I was surprised at how expensive the dishes were, given that they were mainly variations on different pastas. When the meals arrived they were enormous - the sort of size that might be acceptable to someone who hadn't eaten for days - but which in this case were off-putting, especially for the children in our group. My huge dish of soggy gnocchi with a bright red sauce was improved slightly by some fresh asparagus, but only slightly. Most of us left more than half of our meals. The only really good dish was an excellent salad which someone had the good luck to order.Il Forno would do well to serve smaller portions of better quality food.",Il Forno
40,Il forno is placed in the middle of the historic Ledra Street at Nicosia. You can sit in the outside and enjoy nice weather and watch people passing by and enjoying a walk. The food here is really nice. I recently tasted the quattro formaggi which was great. Service is not bad either. Most of the time you won't find a sit unless you do a reservation.,Il Forno
30,"This quick service italian restaurant mainly serves pizza and pasta which are both tasty. Every year it becomes more and more expensive though (average price for a dish that is precooked is 13 euros). We recently visited the place a couple of days ago and we had our 2-year-old with us. So we asked the waiter if they had a kids menu. He said they serve half portions which sounded good. When we got the check we realised that the half portion was called a 2/3 portion and it was actually charged for 10 euros!!! honeslty, that's the most expensive kids dish i have ever paid! so value for money? def not!",Il Forno
30,"We used to go there a lot when it first opened. The food is good and the portions are quite big but the service is now terrible, not at all organized and almost rude and the drinks prices are too high. The tables are small and the chairs uncomfortable.",Il Forno
30,"We have been visiting Il Forno every now and then and we find the quality of the food is not consistent. Usually it’s OK, sometimes it’s excellent. At our last visit it was a case of the former. Portion sizes are good. What I find grating, though, especially in the middle of an economic crisis, is being asked to pay €3.80 for a liter of water. It’s the owner’s prerogative to do so but since I abhor greedy people, I don’t think we’ll be visiting again.",Il Forno
50,"Baked in a wood oven, big variety of options, also very tasty pasta dishes, and fresh salads, excellent service and reasonably priced",Il Forno
40,"I' ve been there many times and I have always enjoyed my food. I love pizza with eggplant and spaghetti with prawns and mussels. The location is great specially if you like watching people passing by, as Il Forno is a street restaurant in the heart of old town of Nicosia.",Il Forno
50,"Excellent food, quick service and hospitability!! Salads are freshly made and pasta..will satisfy any demanding customer!! Just drop by and you wont regret it!!",Il Forno
40,"If you are in Nicosia downtown area and you want a nice Italian pasta dish or a pizza then Il Forno is a very good choice. The quality of the food is given each time. The service is quick and acceptable for a ""street"" dining.",Il Forno
40,"Probably the best italian restaurant in town. Great service but due to the location, sitting is a bit crowded. Prepare to wait to be seated as it's almost always full.",Il Forno
40,"I visited the place a few times and each time the service is good, fast and reliable. The food is consistently good with generous portions that you can't always finish. Selection of wines also good.",Il Forno
40,I would easily claim that this is the best Italian Restaurant in Nicosia.. Both pizzas and pastas are always delicious. The only downside would be the waiting time on a busy day. But its definitely worth to try..,Il Forno
30,The restaurant in on the main shopping Street in Nicosia. There several choices. We ordered pizza and pasta. The quality and taste was medium. The prices were fair enough but yuou can find better choices along the same Street.,Il Forno
40,"I've visited Il Forno several times over the past years and the quality of food is consistently good, with generous portions. It is worth noting that the restaurant is one of the ""go-to"" places of all Nicosians if you fancy a quick, casual Italian which also speaks volumes for its quality. The service is quite efficient and the staff knows the menu, however the they usually seems a bit disengaged and not that bothered of your custom which is a shame, as slightly friendlier attitude would make a difference.For larger parties I'd recommend a reservation as the place is always crowded.",Il Forno
50,"Il Forno is the place we go when we just want a good quality pizza or pasta. It's very reliable, always tasty with cleverly designed pasta and pizza dishes. The location is great and makes for excellent people watching.",Il Forno
40,Vegetarian calzone very good. Nice large portion with plentiful filling. Street dining on main Nicosia 'to be seen' leisure road/area. Small informal restaurant and service good. Bit cramped but okay for street dining.,Il Forno
30,"This place serves the best pizza in town, but its over crowded and you never get to eat comfortably. The service is great though but its claustrophobic and it feels like they want you to leave so they get the next client.",Il Forno
40,"Italian food at its best in the main Nicosia pedestrian road. Good food, good presentation, very good service, relaxed atmosphere,sensible prices, what else would you need for casual dining?",Il Forno
40,"This is a ""street italian"" restaurant with good food and normally good service.Have been here many times and the only thing that can let it down is when it is really busy and the service drops a little, but the good thing is that the standard of the food stays the same.Recommended if you are on Ledra Street in old Nicosia.",Il Forno
40,The food was really nice and it was quickly served. The staff though were not welcoming and running from one table to an other and hurry to do their job which made a bit chaotic atmosphere at the restaurant. I recommend it to anyone on a less busy day!,Il Forno
50,We've been there a few times and the food is very good as well as the service. If u visit it at summertime is even better cos is small and the tables are outside and usually a reservation is needed. I highly recommend the spinach pasta. Located at one of the most historical place of old Nicosia Ledras street Il Forno is surely a very good choice.,Il Forno
50,"A very casual place with good quality food (pizzas ans salates),well presented in the plates, good and friendly service. Must make a reservation as it is small and always full.",Il Forno
40,Right downtown you find this tiny restaurant.The food is great and even during lent they have fasting dishes (the fasting pizza is great)!Because there are only few tables to sit try to reserve or go off dining hours. It's right in the middle of Ledra street - very busy street - and many people would go there.,Il Forno
50,"Value, Delicious food and great atmosphere especially at night. The only negative is that the chairs are not very comfy. The pizzas are very nice my favourite is the cuatro staggioni. Pizza rucola is highly recommended. From the pasta section I would recommend the pasta with broccoli and garlic. REALLY really nice. I haven't tried the appetisers, although they seemed great! I could say that compared to other italian restaurants in combination with the location 'IL Forno' is the best of all!",Il Forno
40,"One of the oldest establishments on the newly revived Ledra-Onasagorou-Phaneromeni triangle, this is a great spot for people watching,offering great value for money food. Its stone-oven pizza is highly recommended",Il Forno
40,if you wish to eat pasta or pizza at a restaurant in the heart of nicosia then IL FORNO is the right place. nice dishes in the walkway of ledra street,Il Forno
30,Went there a Friday evening and we ordered a pizza and a salad. Food was tasty and decently priced but nothing special beyond that. Make sure that you make a reservation before you go unless you want to stand there waiting for a while.,Il Forno
50,Ok this place is fantastic! I stayed just around the corner and ate here on a number of occasions. I found the food really tasty with large portions and very reasonably priced. It has a simple and invitingly clean appearance and being on Ledra st allows to really soak up the atmosphere of the mall. I really recommend people check this place out!,Il Forno

40,"Its one of the best italian restaurants in Nicosia and I go there as often as I can, but last time I went i was very dissapointed from the service. At first they brought us bb plates but no bread. Then when the food came they brought us a glass with the price tag still on! When I told the waiter to take the glass and to bring us a clean one they never did.I will go there again since the food is amazing. I just hope the service gets better and i will definetely give a 5.",Il Forno

50,"I went last week to I Forno in Ledra street.Except that location is very good ,the food was excellent.Two of us ordered spaghetti (carbonara and bolognese) and my daughter ordered a pizza. The size of the plate was too big and we couldn't eat all our food which was very tasty.It was fresh and delicious.The price seems expensive but I believe that it deserves it.I heard that it is possible to order half portion which is very good especially if you have children and they don't eat a lot.",Il Forno
40,"The food was very good, the price was quite high and the service is not really good, the place is too small and almost always crowded...",Il Forno
40,Very good location (in the middle of Ledra street) and offers a wide variety of pastas and pizzas. I visit with my family regularly. Zucchini pasta dish. Highly recommended. A bit pricey for a pasta place however.,Il Forno
40,Great food & not terribly expensive. Everything's fresh. Nice italian beer. I've been here many times.,Il Forno
50,Been there several times. Love the pasta and pizza. Really an authentic Italian restaurant. Love the location. Fast service and generous portions. Will go back. Highly recommended.,Il Forno
30,"We had lunch in this famous pizzeria in Ledras street. Since the main food served is the pizza, we ordered one Vesuvio and one margherita. The service has been slow if I consider that we were the second table with people and The first was at the end. The quality of the pizza not exciting, the base was too dry and crispy more similar to a piadina than a pizza. The price for it was the double compared Italy but average compared other pizzerias in Cyprus.",Il Forno
30,The location is excellent (mid Ledras street) and the food is generally good (although I would appreciate fresh tomato sauce in my lasagna instead of canned). The waiters were a bit impersonal (I appreciate a more caring approach) and the cost of 12.50 euro for an average size portion of lasagne is a bit too much for me! I would eat there again if I couldnt find anything else available close by!,Il Forno
50,"Not much more to add really.Delicious fresh pasta (nice size portion too). Next visit will try the Pizza. Looking at other tables it looked amazing.Located on Ledras street, very busy restaurant not a big place so you may need to book at busy periods.Fast service.Highly recommended",Il Forno

50,I have been more than 100 times in this restaurant.Small restaurant in the Ledras street with a vintage-italian decor.The 75-80 i ordered the zucchini pasta. Its the best pasta I have ever eaten in an Italian restaurant. I tried also many pastas in Italy but I have never eaten better than that.Also pizzas and lasagna are pretty good.Try it and maybe you will see me around there:),Il Forno
40,"This place has pretty good Italian food. The pizzas are quite good, the pastas are a hit-and-miss, salads are good. It's one of the better restaurants in the old town of Nicosia.The staff and the waiters and friendly and helpful. The service is good but becomes a bit sloppy when the restaurant is packed (took a long while for them to get us the cheque).",Il Forno
40,Il Forno is great. Excellent food. very good service and fast. Its always packed so its better to make a booking,Il Forno
50,"This is a small restaurant - nothing fancy - downtown in Nicosia, good and lively location though. The quality is consistent and good, I recommend their pizzas as they are similar to the italian thin ones, If you are a fan of the (American) pan pizzas you may not appreciate it!!",Il Forno
30,Good for a rest after walking in old town Nicosia. The food was decent but when the restaurant is full the service becomes a nightmare!,Il Forno
40,very good quality of pasta and pizza.reasonable prices. good location. baby friendly. good choice for lunch.,Il Forno
50,"One of the most delicious experiences in italian cuisine of Nicosia! Great service, location and above all a delicious meal! Great variety of pizzas and pastas!",Il Forno
30,"Let down by variable service.Some of the waiters are generally nice and friendly, some seem only interested in their ""special guests"", we've been several times, both on busy Saturday nights (when it's almost impossible to get a table) and even on a quiet Monday evening when there were only 3 tables in use. The same indifferent service came up each time, at one point a waiter looked at our empty plates and turned his back on us to continue chatting to another waiter, we skipped the dessert, eventually managing to pay and leave.Perhaps the waiters don't like foreigners or perhaps they earn enough from the bookings not to worry about the walk-in business, either way, although the food is good, it's not cheap (2 main course pasta dishes and 2 soft drinks = €30.80) or good enough for me to want to try it again.",Il Forno
20,"Ledras street is the famous street of Nicosia. The greek part. This restaurant is always sold out or with different words it is difficult/hard to find a free table.This restaurant is a specialist for Pizza.I am sure that most guests are satisfied with the pizza of this restaurant. Guests who know Italy or other western countries where you will find a big number of Pizzerias will not be satisfied with this Pizza Salami of Pizza Quattro stagioni with less contents and a poor taste thick and not crispy might satisfied other guest. I am not accepting that I need to pay almost 15 € for each.Here you will get less quality, poor taste for much money.Go away and search for better restaurants. You will find it in the neighboorhood!",Il Forno
50,"We went there several times and every time we try something new and the quality and service is always very good! That for me defines a good restaurant, keeping its standards in food and service. The menu consists of pizza, pasta and salad dishes. We usually order a pizza and a salad and share and we are always full at the end of our meal. I especially like the rocket salad with parmesan and dried tomatoes and the smoked salmon pasta. They always offer bread with olive dip as a starter on the house. I guess the only disadvantage for me is the wine list which consists of only 2 different kinds of small bottles of wine. I wish they had more variety. Overall, I love this place.",Il Forno
50,"Again and again... top class italian in lydras street! kids amazed by the quality & quantidy!!! service excellent!!! busy busy cz food is fantastic , the service great & prises reasonable... Go for it!!!",Il Forno

40,"As other reviews have said, setting is ok but the food is only good, expected a little more but wasn't completely disappointed. Their service is quick and price is relatively on point, portions are huge, but for our tastes the food was overalls little too rich. Worth a shot but not 5 stars",Il Forno
40,"If you want pasta, its a nice choice in old Nicosia centre. You must walk a small distance from the closest parking if there is availability.",Il Forno
50,This Italian restaurant just be for you get to the border post to Northern Nicosia is awesome the food was first rate and huge portions especially the Calzone. The staff were attentive and well majored. Definitely recommend it if you are going to be in Nicosia.,Il Forno
30,"Although I expected more after reading the reviews on this site, it was an altogether okay experience. We tried the lasagne, which was pretty good, and the mozzarella salad, which was okay as well. The seating was not that great, but it was out in Ledras Street, so there was a nice feel to being out in the old town. The service was quick, which is commendable. You can also see that they make everything fresh from the glass-style kitchen portrayed in the back of the restaurant. The prices were not as reasonable as I expected by the look of the place, but not unacceptable high either.",Il Forno
50,"I've been visiting this restaurant so many times over the years and always enjoyed the food, whether it was pizza - thin crust original italian, or pasta with cherry tomaroes and fera cheese or even green salad, generous portion, so fresh!

50,Excellent food and friendly staff!!! Fast service and nice place!!! The pizza is the best food an this place!! Also I like very much the calzone!!! Is very spicy and very large amount of food!!!,Il Forno
40,I have been there twice. The food is very nice. I have tried pasta and pizza. The service is very good. The place is very small after all. It's quite expensive though and a thing I really didn't like is that there were flies around us (only the second time). I would prefer to go there for a takeaway pizza.,Il Forno
50,"Its pizzas are delicious, i love them and Il forno is probably my favourite italian restaurant in Nicosia. If you are a broccoli fan then definitely try out its broccoli pizza and you wont miss out ;)",Il Forno
30,"Always busy in the centre of Ledra Street. This place has become the standard for Italian Pizza and Pasta in Nicosia. The food is always fresh and tasty and with a variety for all taste buds you will surely find something to your liking. We ordered salad,pasta and pizza. The salad was under dressed and as such a little dry. We ordered wine which didn't come adequately cooled and without a wine cooler. The pizza and Pasta was great as it usually is.",Il Forno
50,"Literally in the pedestrian street of the town, casual, busy, unsophisticated, loud and a bit chaotic....still great to visit. Pizzas and fresh salad is the right combination. Any time of the day will do. A good choice.",Il Forno
40,"I visited this place a couple of times and was absolutely satisfied both time. Their funghi (mushroom) pizza is one of the best I ever had. They use fresh and dried flavourful mushrooms which are not used by many pizza places. The pizza is thin and crispi, as a pizza should be.Was a bit disappointed that the carbonara was made of cream...Location doesn't allow for great atmosphere and/or comfort.If TripAdvisor rating system allowed a 4.5 rating I would rate it 4.5",Il Forno
40,"generous portions and very tasty, authentic ingredients and recipes... not too expensive and great if you like watching the street life go by - central Nicosia location",Il Forno
40,Il forno is at ledras street. I love tthe pizza and salads. Quality is constantly high over the years. Very good place!,Il Forno
50,This restaurant handsome of the best food I've ever had. The salad with Parmesan and pinenuts was mouthwatering while the meat pizza was flavourful and heavenly. It was an absolute party in my mouth.,Il Forno
40,This place is really busy in the evening and we were lucky to get a table. They have a proper wood burning oven and the pizzas are thin and crispy. Not the best pizza I have ever had but still enjoyable. My husbands tried a creamy vegetable pasta which had crispy aubergine strips on top. The portion was huge its enough to feed at least two people. The salads looked good too but we never got the chance to visit again.,Il Forno
50,"Excellent food situated in an excellent location. Very reasonable prices. We paid approx. 20 euro per person for starter, main dish and wine!",Il Forno
40,they do all three very well. Big portions for those who care. This place has been around for a while now and they haven't compromised quality or service. Very good. It's always full. Try going for early lunch or dinner to avoid disappointment.,Il Forno
40,"Located in the middle of Ledra's pedestrian street, in the heart of the old town of Nicosia, Il Fornoitalian restaurant, is a good choise for a quick lunch or dinner, before or after shopping.Especially pastas are delicious. Try my favourite one which is rigattoni with spinach basil and greek-fetta cheese.Is lovely ! Enjoy a Keo cold beer as well.Excellent quick service and reasonable prises.",Il Forno
20,"The collage salad was good as the aubergine. Someone has written that this pizza was the best in Cyprus. I wonder how bad are all the others. They do not use real mozzarella, the other ingradents very salty. The pasta very heavt. At best below average. Jenny, go back to the drawing board!",Il Forno
30,"We were a party of 3; were unfortunate to visit Il Forno on a very hot Saturday noon; tables were so disorganized and crowded that made the service more unpleasant; we were seated on a small table; me sitting in the burning sun outside the covered area.We ordered one Salad and 2 different Pizzas; thinking to share the Salad first, then move to share the two Pizzas; all were served together; and as the table was so small, we couldn’t share, and each of us was stuck with one dish. On the positive side the Salad portion was huge and delicious; the Pizzas were very basic and tasteless, however the crust was great although burnt. The price could be fine if the Pizza was richer.In summary; we didn’t enjoy our lunch; if we want to eat Italian food; we would rather order it delivery.",Il Forno
40,Offering a variety of quality pizzas and pasta il forno restaurant is rightfully listed as one of the top 10 restaurants in Nicosia. It's true you can find cheaper food around but the quility will not be the same.,Il Forno
50,"I have to say that I have visited iL Forno several times, and I must say that the standarts are always high and top quality. Whether that is service or the quality and quantity of their plates i love this restaurant. I would defenitely keep visiting it and would recoment it to anyone.",Il Forno

40,"The restaurant is located in the heart of Nicosia, on the most famous pedestrian road of the city (Ledras Str). The place is a great choice for families, friends, as well as business meetings. It has variety of tastefull dishes (salads, pastas, pizzas, calzones), with good quality and quantity, and also good prices. The staff is helpful and cheerful. A small negative is the small indoors area, which is not enough during cold days, but this is not a serious problem for Cyprus! Overall is a great choice!!",Il Forno
40,"The food was good fresh Italian; plenty of it and freshly cooked. Good value and staff very helpful. Very popular, so get there early.",Il Forno
50,"High quality ingredients, pasta was excellent, very good service, very nice environment . !!!!! The pizza was amazing. For sure i will visit again.",Il Forno
40,"We went on a busy Saturday afternoon and we were lucky to find a table. Even though it was really busy waiters gave us the appropriate attention. Meals were nice, tasteful and big enough portions. It is located in pedestrian street and mostly all of the tables are actually outside the restaurant. Not really a fan of eating outside so therefore i didn't give a better score for the atmosphere. If you enjoy italian food you must try it, it is worth it!",Il Forno
50,"In the middle of a tourist walkway, the last thing you expect is a descent Italian restaurant. But believe it or not, this is one! Classic pizzas (love their dough) and the pasta is not bad as well. Good portions and good value for money. Very quick service, the place is ideal for a quick lunch. Casual enough to just drop in, but good enough for a business lunch.",Il Forno
50,The pasta is always the same way cooked and always superb. We love the garlic bread with cheese. Good to have a reservation especially during peak hours.,Il Forno
50,"This restaurant is in a great location on Ledra Street. The food is very reasonably priced and also freshly made and really tasty. I have sampled a number of the pasta dishes, as well as pizzas and everything has been really good. I would definitely recommend il Forno. It is quite small so it is best to make a reservation, especially if you want to sit inside rather than the outside tables in the pedestrian street.",Il Forno
50,"I highly recommend ""il forno"" was there last nigh for the first time. Food is fresh, tasty and reasonable prices. Service is fast and the interior very inviting. It's a very small restaurant so I advise everyone to make reservations before showing up.I wish the island had more small cosy places like this.",Il Forno
50,"Il Forno on Ledra Street in Nicosia is small, quaint and yes the best pasta, pizza and roka (arugula) salad this side of Italy. As an American Italian I can say that Il Forno's pasta dishes, freshly made pizzas and salads are by far the best on the Island and can stand up to any pizza anywhere on the globe! Great place to share a pizza and a beer with a little people watching on the side.",Il Forno
40,"Yes it is in the middle of the pedestrian street, but their is no interferance. It is well managed, with good service, Good pizzas with a good wine list. We were invited by friends in Nicosia and were a group of 8, Everybody enjoyed their dinner and no complaints. This is a good value for money pizza and pasta place of good quality.",Il Forno
40,"Split your meal bc the portions are huge! The service is fast and friendly. Even tjough it was off season, this place always had a crowd (which is a good sign to me). It's great for people watching since its right on theain drag and wide open. Nice wine selection and great value if you split your meal. Good value if you don't.",Il Forno
40,great pizza for a decent prize. high tourist area if that is what your looking for. but overall i would say one of the best italian restaurants in this area. authentic foreign dishes are rare to come by in nicosia so if your itching for some good italian pizza they got it.,Il Forno
30,"Nice place to have a quick lunch or dinner. The quality of food is good. Pizza is excellent. However, they could have added 2-3 plates with meat.",Il Forno
50,"It can be very crowded during weekends and you may need a reservation, but the place is worth trying. The food is fresh, exquisetely cooked and comes up really quick.",Il Forno
50,"Il Forno is like a blue chip stock. It's high quality never changes. Pastas, salads and pizzas are so tasty and so fulfilling that is almost a crime to go for pasta anywhere else. Strongly recommended!!",Il Forno
40,A local friend took us to this restaurant during a brief visit to Nicosia. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good Italian restaurant in the heart of the city. I had the Bocconina pizza. Great pizza baked in a traditional wood oven as it should be!,Il Forno
40,Its in city center so its a great opportunity for sopping and then enjoy some good Italian food. Good place for Friends and family,Il Forno
20,The situation with this restaurant is strange. This is the second time I've been there and I need to say that sitting in the exact middle of a very busy and dirty pedestrian road is not the most pleasant thing. Pasta ok...pizza below average...service...ok the people are trying their best,Il Forno
40,"Although the restaurant surroundings are not fancy, this is one of the best places in Cyprus to eat Italian food. Whether it is pizza or pasta that you order here, you really cannot go wrong. It is simply delicious and the owner is always trying to please everyone and fit them in surrounding tables.",Il Forno
50,"The food there is really italian, the prices are fairly good and the place is always packed.Wonder why?? People recognises and goes back to places that keep their good quality of food over the years.The service is always good and pleasand and even if you have to wait for a while you can stroll around the pedestrian steet and come back to take your sit!",Il Forno
40,"Good food, fast, attentive service, great location - particularly fine for people watching. Outdoor heaters make it possible to enjoy the experience out of season.",Il Forno
40,"Been to this restaurant again after 4-5 years, the quality is still as high, service very efficient, owner always there making sure everything is OK. If you are looking for well cooked, tasty, hearty, pasta / pizza lunch or dinner then you will not be disappointed by Il Forno.",Il Forno
40,"The food here is excellent ! I have comeback several times during the year and although the menu has never changed the food quality & portions are all very good and have remained consistent .While you wait they bring a plate of hot freshly baked bread to dip in olive oil , it is always very much appreciated . I always order the rocket salad , i have never had a better one anywhere else - also to say its big it's an understatement . I feel that I get good value for money here !",Il Forno
40,What I like most about this place are its pizzas. Really good ingredients and very professionally baked. The restaurant is located in Ledra street (known for its crossing between the free and occupied part of Nicosia) which is busy any time of the day or evening. I much prefer going there in the evening as temperatures can soar during daytime especially in the summer. I must say I was less enthusiastic with its seafood salad - which I found too salty and the prawns overcooked.,Il Forno
30,"nice italian- fresh dishes- downsize is located in the busy street of ledra, people selling kids staff nearby on a mobile trolley",Il Forno
50,"This is by far our favorite pasta place in Nicosia if not Cyprus and I would not be exaggerating if i said it is one of my family's absolute favorite restaurants. The service is very good (something rare in Cyprus!) and we can usually be in and out within an hour if we want to. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The pasta is always perfectly cooked and the ingredients are always fresh. I have several dietary restrictions but i absolutely love the mare monte and the al ghamberi which i highly recommend. My husband cannot stay away from their bolognese for more than a couple of weeks. And the salads are all excellent, although we uusally get the green salad which is simple yet delicious. We go for a family night out, with friends and kids, as a couple, or with other couples. We love the place and enjoy it year-round, nside ot outside, although the outside is better even in winter with the outdoor heaters. The location also allows for some people watching if in the mood or, if not, a table on the side street offers more quiet. It also allows for walking to get dessert or coffee in any one of the nearby shops, although Il Forno's espresso and tiramasu are harvd to beat. The price is decent for Nicosia, about 40 euros for a salad, two pasta dishes, water, soft drink and espresso (which is often on the house!), including tip. Pasta dishes are about ten euros.",Il Forno
10,"I have been to Il Forno a few times, each time thinking that my previous experience must have been a bad day for the restaurant, given the good to excellent reviews it has been receiving. The spot with it's tables spilling out onto Ledra street is admittedly very good. Service is quick but unsmiling, impersonal and very ill informed, especially regarding Italian food and in particular the restaurant's own menu. The pasta is described as excellent in many other reviews. I beg to disagree. Having lived in Italy for seven years I can definitely say that the pasta here is overcooked, the sauces/sugo precooked, arrives tepid at the table and has the same relationship to Italian cuisine as British Spag Bol. Pasta should be cooked 'al dente', with freshly prepared sauces oozing Mediterranean aromas that do not overwhelm the dish and should arrive piping hot at the table. The pizza is just about OK but not dissimilar to many delivery/take-away examples in Nicosia.All in all the food at Il Forno takes no account of the great leaps and bounds in imagination, execution and presentation that Italian gastronomy has made in the past twenty years. It is also sadly unaware of the traditional techniques, mores and values of classic Italian cuisine.If Cypriot dishes are to be masqueraded as Italian then this restaurant would be better called 'O fournos'.",Il Forno
50,Great thin crust Roman pizza in Cyprus. Best time to go is after seven. Don't forget to book your table or you risk to stay in the line. Stuff is very welcoming and polite. Today was really hot and we got complimentary cherry yogurt.,Il Forno
40,Food is very good. Need to make a reservation before going.,Il Forno
50,"Nice pizzas and pastas, will cost about 10 -15 euros per person for food and drink.",Il Forno
50,"Excellent pasta, great spot (on ledras street) and fast service!",Il Forno
30,"Right on Ledras street it is a good option for a lunch break or a casual dinner. The pizzas are ok, and the pastas are quite good, but the menu has been the same for the last 10 years, with only its prices changing. I prefer Tavolino on the parallel street of Onasagorou",Il Forno
40,"We met up with family to enjoy a nice meal outside and the food was good and the quality was great and the portions were big. We sat outside since that is where most of the seating is and loved being able to visit and also people watch.It's a great part of old Cyprus and I love to come and do a little shopping , eating and walking around.The selection of food is worthy of a visit.",Il Forno
50,"All fresh and tasty pastas, pizzas and salad in the italian style. Not many tables so reserving is a good idea but the food is faultless. The only thing i dont liek is they used to bring you little balls of dough and oil/vinegar when ordering and you dont seem to get those any more. I recommend the l'inventiva with tagliatelle, and a nice crisp glass of house wine on the side. they also do a mean panacotta but they often run out!",Il Forno
30,"If you're looking for just a quick Italian bite than it'll do. it's located right in the middle of one Nicosia's busiest street, and not in the good way. There's barely any inside seating and sitting outside seems a bit stressfull. The food is just ok, i order the La Primavera pasta dish which wasn't as hot as i expected. If you're just strolling around the old city you could refuel with a quick dish and continue your walk. So don't expect a romantic atmosphere nor a high quality Italian dish!",Il Forno
40,"I believe that the place being almost always full, says it all!",Il Forno
50,The food is delicious. The service is excellent. And the location is fabulous. Highly recommended!,Il Forno
50,"Excellent spot in downtown Nicosia. Right in the middle of pedestrian Ledra Street, it's convenient after a stroll around the shops and a visit to the checkpoint. The food is really good with a decent selection of starters and a great variety of pizzas and pasta. Highly recommended!",Il Forno
40,"This is not a 5 star restaurant by no means. But its the best value for money pizza pasta place in Nicosia. Simple, basic and delicious. Especially the pizza is fantastic, at par with the bestBook to go. Great for kids with lots of place to move around the square",Il Forno
40,"We visited Il Forno two days ago, right in the middle of Ledra street. The food is really good, we had a caprese salad, a fresh mozzarella pizza and a carbonara; all three dishes were very good. I totally recommend it",Il Forno
50,"Great pastas, quick service and big portions. A little bit expensive but definitely worth the visit",Il Forno
50,"I go there almost every week) & it s always full!! As it s fast but yet sooo tasty, both pastas & pizzas)) Try their Primavera & enjoy the delicious mouthwatering panacota))",Il Forno
40,standard italian food usually all food is fresh and quickly repared,Il Forno
40,"Been there with the family.. Really great pastas,excellent garlic bread(homemade),and freshly cut salads.The service was quick and efficient.Very reasonable prices.Need to make a reservation though,cause the place is very busy.",Il Forno
40,This restaurant is situated in Ledra Street and so have limited seating. The food however is more than satisfactory. I could even say that it is probably the best Italian resaturant on the island.,Il Forno
50,"A great pizza and pasta restaurant on ledra street, the food is tasty and the portions are big! well worth a visit, especially during the warmer months when you can sit on the pavement and watch the world go by.",Il Forno
50,"We eat here often while out shopping on a Saturday. Most of the tables are out in the (pedestrian) street so you can sit there watching the world go by and enjoying their excellent pizzas, pastas and salads. Inside tables are very few but in cold weather they have overhead gas heaters in the street to keep you warm. It's ALWAYS busy and there are usually people waiting for tables - best to make a reservation to avoid this.This is not what comes to mind when I think ""Italian restaurant"": it's informal, busy, and mostly outside. Don't expect romantic candlelit tables with red-and-white checked tablecloths. But the food is excellent, the service friendly and efficient, and the prices reasonable.",Il Forno
50,I had spaghetiic carbonara and spaghetti bolognese. Both were excellent. Portions are large. Dish of grated cheese on the size was almost too much to use.,Il Forno
40,"Italian food at its best! Pasta, pizza freshly and perfectly cooked. The king of the pedestrian area of old Nicosia-with-in-the-walls!",Il Forno
40,"An excellent italian restaurant in old Nicosia. Original Italian food in reasonable prices. Casual environment. Most of the tables are on Ledras street (pedestrian), so when shops are open you can see shoppers walk up and down the street. It's always busy so it's better to have a reservation before you go.",Il Forno
40,"This Italian resto right on Ledras str., is a very casual place where you just eat and go. There's much rotation and on rush hours you can many times find yourself standing on the side waiting for a table to free in order to have a sit. It's not the restaurant with the real meaning of the word. Service is quick and within an hour you are done and on the go. It is true though that they serve the best pasta in the city. There is a wide selection of pizzas and salads as well. But I feel more confident to comment especially on the pasta dishes. During winter interior seating area is very limited so reservations are a must if you want to be seated inside.",Il Forno
50,Excellent quality and value for money food in the heart of old Nicosia! Do try the L'inventiva and the pizza with an egg in the middle!!,Il Forno
40,"Fast service, original italian flavours, well prepared dishes.",Il Forno
30,"Il Forno is usually packed and you might find yourself waiting a bit for sitting (especially at night). Most tables are outdoors, right on ledras street so this makes Il Forno a nice spot to eat and watch people walking by. Their pizza is very good even though a little bit on the 'oily' side. The pasta is ok, though I find it a bit hit-and-miss with their ingredients (sometimes it tastes better than others). The staff are to the point and you will find all sorts of customers here, from locals to tourists.",Il Forno
50,i stayed in nicosia for one week. and i had my food there. three times. :D,Il Forno
50,"We noticed this little corner restaurant with a lot of tables on the street just this summer 2011. We went there a few times during summer. Everytime, we loved it. We tried their salads, pastas, pizzas and lasagna and all were delicious. Excellent atmosphere and friendly service at all times. I'd give them a call 1hr before coming so I don't have to wait to be seated.",Il Forno
50,"tiny place, small selection of great food, and good prices. great for people watching too.",Il Forno
40,"Yes, I love their food, but not the place itself so much. It is usually very crowded but of course it’s the good food to be blamed for this. They have a lot of choice for pizza and pasta; the menu could have a few more salads though. The food is served very fast; the service is good in general, although we have had some unpleasant incidents and mistaken food during their “rush hour”, so we try to avoid weekend/lunch time.",Il Forno
50,i have been to this restaurant more than 20 time this year and everytime if go food is better. i tried everything as i am a pasta type person.....the food is reaaaaallllly good.it is located in ledras street which is the oldest pedestrian street in Nicosia full of shops and restaurants and cafeterias. the price a big high for pasta but it worths every penny.i would recommend it to everybody!!!,Il Forno

I love sitting and watching people passing by.Advice: don't visit on weekends during the rush hours (lunch 13:00-15:00), you must be way to lucky to find a table!!!! It's packed! If you still insist to go - make a reservation : )",Il Forno
50,"Located in the center of the most popular shopping street, with only a few tables offers the best italian food in town. Great pasta, delicious salads, crunchy pizzas.

40,"Very good food quality, reservation can save time, environment could be even much better",Il Forno
40,"I love the location on one of Nicosia's only pedestrian streets. It looks and feels like a ""trattoria"". Thanks to generous gas heaters, it is possible to sit outside almost 365 days.Salads, Pizzas and pastas are all very good. Especially the Rucola Salad, the spaghetti with olive oil and garlic and many more I cant remember :)Service is fast and efficient, prices are good.Highly recommended.",Il Forno
40,"I consider Il Forno to be one of the few ""best value of money"" restaurants Nicosia has to offer. Well prepared dishes, friendly staff, reasonable prices. The place can be overcrowed, which is the case in most of the times, yet this can not be viewed as a minor rather that an appreciation to what the restaurant serves.",Il Forno
30,I arrived alone in this pizzeria. Quite busy but staff was friendly. For my part the pizza was much to oily and the ingredients were not fresh ones. On the other hand it was tasteful and an enjoyable terrace in Ledra street.,Il Forno

Indeed its a very casual place to eat, for a quick lunch mainly or dinner. Service excellent at all times even when the place is crowded like Sunday lunchtime. (Definetely reserve well in advance for Sunday lunch). Italian beer and of course Italian wines available. Italian food only (no alternative meat dishes). Everything fresh, prepared on the premises.Inside premises are very limited and mostly consists of tables outside which can get tricky when it rains! (It doesn't rain often but when it rains it pours!!). Highly recommended for a quick, inexpensive, top-quality Italian meal.",Il Forno

40,"Very nice food.In the middle of the old Nicosia city, on the most famous pedestrian street (Ledras).The quantity is more than enough and the prices are very good for the quality.As a Nicosia citizen, I have to make a complain: if you order for delivery, they send it with a taxi(!!!) and you have to pay for it!!! The bad thing is that they don't inform you beforehand.",Il Forno
