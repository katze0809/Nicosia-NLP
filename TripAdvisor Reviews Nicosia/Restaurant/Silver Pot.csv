50,Funky hippy lunch. Amazingly tasty food and smiley happy service! What more could we ask on a Sunday lunchtime in Nicosia!,Silver Pot
50,"Yummy breakfast. Big portions. Cool kind staff. Nice ambiance. The interior is nice. The location is easy. It‚Äôs good for gathering, work and brunch.",Silver Pot
20,"Granted that the two front tables were reserved, I decided to sit at a table at the back with high bar stools and wait for my friend to come. Before even greeting me, an evidently untrained waitress comes and asks me how many people I am expecting. The moment I tell her one person, she rudely suggests I move to the 'bar' facing the kitchen and throws the menus on the bar. At this point, she doesn't even acknowledge how rude she's being granted this was NOT a reserved table. Just because it was four people that evidently frequent the place and she knows them from what I understood, does not give a carte blanche to treat other customers having a quick casual business lunch like that. I will not be recommending the place, although the food was alright, nothing spectacular. Won't miss it.",Silver Pot
50,"We had 2 x 18.75cl bottles of wine. One white and one red for ‚Ç¨4.00 each - good value. I had the silver pot French toast with Brie, bacon and Canadian maple syrup - cost was ‚Ç¨9.00 and excellent value. The other was smoked salmon, avocado and green salad with other - this was ‚Ç¨12.00. Total was ‚Ç¨29.00. The restaurant was packed solid and service was quick.",Silver Pot
20,"Poorly prepared food, rude staff and uncomfortable seating. We had brunch at this place but we were very disappointed by the whole experience.",Silver Pot
50,"Initially, I didn't think it would be hard to find a place serving at least an English breakfast in a place like Cyprus but it wasn't exactly easy in Lefkosia/Nicosia until I found Silver Pot where I could get a couple of eggs fried along with some bacon. It was so good and the price was right that I went back the following day despite being 800m away from my hotel.",Silver Pot
50,It is really beautiful place and nicely decorated. You feel the good vibes and nice atmosphere. The menu is simple but the food delicious. The omlette with halloumi was well cooked and the mixed juice was fresh. The desert called flan was tasty. The service excellent and the waitresses super kind and helpful. I highly recommend this place for breakfast and brunch or lunch as well. Prices are acceptable too the omlettte plate is around 8 euros for example.,Silver Pot
50,"Pleasant layback environment, nice decoration, good service, an interesting menu with good prices. Smart and novel recipes, freshly prepared and delicious. A great place for brunch or light lunch.",Silver Pot
40,Loved the omelette with spinach! Eggs were excellent in general. Coffee was also very good. Service was good. Stuff very friendly,Silver Pot
50,"By walking Nicosia quite early in the morning, I found this place in the middle of some street, close to some office buildings. I waited till they had open the kitchen and I asked for advice on what to order. The person who attended me was extremely nice and very helpful, also giving me tips about the city and very open to help me. The pictures are not misleading - you will get very good and appealing meals, you would want to take pics of it.",Silver Pot
40,"Pleasant experience for breakfast in Nicosia. Nice atmosphere, Service was very nice, pancake was delicious and a good coffee.",Silver Pot
50,"I adore this place, I‚Äôve been here many times and the food is always amazing. The staff are so welcoming and the place has a really chilled out vibe. My favourite place for brunch. The blueberry pancakes r to die for ü§ó",Silver Pot
50,"Lazy Sunday menu was pretty awesome, excellent service and great size portions. Three happy eaters, will be back.",Silver Pot
50,"Food is delicious. Try American pancakes whit Emmentaler cheese and roasted bakon, it s very tastfull üê¨üíñ‚ôÄÔ∏è",Silver Pot
20,"One of the most fashionable places according to Nicosians for brunch. Went here on the weekend with my girlfriend. She ordered a salad. I am very cautious of the brunch craze seen lately in Cyprus, since I find in most cases that it is driven purely by fashion and not quality. So I decided to go simple, ordering scrambled eggs and pancakes with maple syrup. The eggs were served in a bowl where the liquid bottom was clearly visible. I tasted them and it turned out that the whole mass was liquid and undercooked. So I didn't touch it further. The pancakes were huge, and when I saw them I thought at least I will be able to satisfy my hunger! But alas, they were undercooked and liquid/floury. Sorry guys, but when I order scrambled eggs and pancakes at a place that is supposed to be awesome for brunch, I expect quality cause the dishes are too simple and they are a mainstay for all brunch places. The fact that the place was full cannot be used as an excuse. To their credit when they saw that I left the scrambled eggs untouched, they asked me what was the problem. I told them they are too watery and that I have never seen scrambled eggs like that before, to which they replied that that is how they do them always and that next time I should ask for ""dry scrambled eggs"". I found that pretty funny so i didn't engage in discussion with them. Anyway, in the final bill, they did not charge the scrambled eggs.",Silver Pot
50,Really enjoyed going for breakfast with my family. They were very accommodating with slight changes to our order and were very cheerful. I would definitely go again.,Silver Pot
50,Visiting this place for about 4-5 years. Excellent food quality. Probably the best bruch in town. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommended,Silver Pot
40,"Really tasty dishes, one of the best brunch places in Nicosia. They have a good variety of brunch options. The place is very cozy, really cute with friendly staff. The only disadvantage is that you will most probably have to wait until you find a table but this shows that the place is popular!",Silver Pot
50,"Lovely cute place, even though it is always packed, the staff are very friendly and find us a table with minimum wait time. I tried several dishes, they were all lovely with fresh ingredients and suburb taste. Make sure to try the pizza and the blueberry pancakes, amazing! I keep coming back and always love it!",Silver Pot
50,"Was the first time that we visited and I had hot sandwich with avocado, humus, tomatoes etc and my bf had pancake with cheese ,curred meats and syrup. The food was DELICIOUS! It was the best brunch , so tasty ! We also had fresh fruit salad which was also nice! Our waitress Olymbia was the sweetest and the kindest from the minute that we got into that place until we left! She was very helpful! We had the best first impression at silver Pot! Will definitely visit again and recommend it.",Silver Pot
30,Would have thought by the buzz and the waiting that this was something special. Nothing really - I'd dare say overpriced eggs and pancakes,Silver Pot
30,"I've been to Silver Pot a few times and I also regularly recommend it to people that have yet to try it. Food is generally great, some interesting dishes as well, and atmosphere is good. But during the last visit, I had asked to be seated inside and waited for my turn..Only to then watch another 3 separate groups of people, who had arrived after us, be seated first.Meanwhile, not a word to us i.e. sorry this is how we prioritize or whatever, some excuse at least. It was perfectly clear that this had happened and was not hard to see. It is not a big place after all. To be honest i'll probably come again, but I must say it is not nice to be treated in this way. I suggest you work on how you seat and prioritize people on busy days like Saturday. Customers do not like being treated as resources.Thank you.",Silver Pot
50,Its a pity that this place is small. Everything served is so delicious especially the maple syrup crepes. Was there with a friend and by newborn. Friendly staff.,Silver Pot
50,Really good food and service at this little breakfast and lunch spot. We tried to go a second time but it was packed out with locals which says something. Good fresh tasty food with lots of vegetarian options. The waitstaff were young and funky in an efficient cool way!,Silver Pot
50,"There where you can feel the magic in your stomach, created by a unique group of beautiful people from the heart, a place with the name of a ""silver pot"".start and finish your day by nourishing your mood with a delicious meal in this colorful place where every little thing that meets your eye has a wonderful story to say..",Silver Pot
40,"Me and my cousin visited this place for breakfast. The atmosphere is nice and comfy. The girl who served us was friendly and she patiently explained the menu as it was our first time there.. We ordered sandwiches which were tasty with fresh ingredients, but Very Oily because of the oil dressing. The coffee from the machine is delicious as well. Reasonable prices. If you are around and want a snack this is great place.",Silver Pot
40,"One of our favorite spots in Nicosia for Brunch!! Personally, I love the yogurt pot with fruits and granola! Good Quality but little bit high prices for Nicosia!",Silver Pot
40,"The food is amazing, with one of the better vegetarian/vegan-friendly menus I've seen in Cyprus, where those are not common eating styles. The coffee is delicious, and the servers are kind. Do keep in mind, especially for the American traveler, it is normal to have to ask someone if you need something sometimes, you're not being rude (as long as you're polite about it), but it's a small place they get busy, so don't just sit around and wait for someone to check on you if you need something. They are so very accommodating and attentive and thoughtful, and know their menu very well, so don't be shy to ask! Their specials are always delicious and seasonal, and I hear their waffles are legendary, but haven't gotten to try it because they are only offered in limited hours. But their salads and desserts are regularly amazing. Consistent quality, accessible people, and everyone I've spoken to speaks perfect English, if that's a need of yours. And free water! Which is not common in Cyprus table-service establishments.",Silver Pot
50,"Incredible place! Food is amazing, every dish is like masterpiece, even coffee! Absolutely the greatest place in Cyprus, also for Vegetarians and Vegans! And off course girls which are working there, you are making this place. They are cool and friendly!",Silver Pot
50,The quality of their is at another level. The Vibe is homy. The waitresses are cool yet very professional. Simply the best.,Silver Pot
50,Little cozy restaurant where you can get amazing brunch. I have visited silver pot 4 times so far and will be definitely visiting again. I tried all the pancakes on the menu. Staff is very helpful and polite.,Silver Pot
40,We went for a relaxed brunch on a Saturday morning. There is a good variety of dishes and staff were very friendly. Nice food and a decent portion as well :),Silver Pot
50,This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The quality of the food truly stands out.We were with my friend and for some reason the kitchen wasn‚Äôt able to bring her what she ordered at first. The stuff was very polite and offered as a brownie in the end.We appreciate the kind gesture and we will definitely go back again.,Silver Pot
50,Came for brunch with friends. Service was quick and staff very friendly and accommodating with our needs. Will definitely return,Silver Pot
50,"Very very good choice for sandwiches and brunch! It offers many choices to eat and drink. Is a cosy place, located centrally in the town. Very normal prices. Full reccomended!",Silver Pot
40,"They offer wide food choices for weekend brunches from sandwiches, toasts, salad and pancakes. The waitresses needs to have personality tho. Some of them looks grumpy and seem unhappy. They dont give the menu until they are fully open at 10am.Serving is huge for me and oerhaps good for too, suitable for family or couple too.",Silver Pot
20,The price was excessive for the portion size. The actual food was lost in the salad. I would definitely not recommend this for Brunch on a week day.,Silver Pot
20,"We came to have our breakfast on Sunday morning. I have ordered pancakes with ham and cheese and my boyfriend has ordered pancakes with blueberries.First of all, the majority of waitresses didn‚Äôt look appropriately . We understood that the tattoos and clothing is a part of style. But seeing unwashed hair and that waitresses doesn‚Äôt look after themselves - disturbing.Secondly, the food wasn‚Äôt special at all. I wouldn‚Äôt pay 7 euros for a pancake with ham and cheese. They even didn‚Äôt try to make it look more beautiful. They have just ripped the ham and some cheese and put it on the pancake.I believe that the place should offer something unique. Whether it‚Äôs an atmosphere , food decoration, or something else.In silver pot everything was below the average for me.Quite noisy, small, not a place to relax on a Sunday morning. Food quality - average , quantity - average. Overpriced .",Silver Pot
40,"Have been going here for years. Kids love it, quality of food if is always good. Service always with a smile, and they do their best to seat you as quickly as possible (always busy ). Pancakes with blueberries great, nice combinations of foods. A bit pricey on some items, however its a nice casual environment.",Silver Pot
40,"I have been here a few times at lunchtime and the food has always been very good.the portions are large and the service is very good. Food is always served really nice and the good thing is that the menu changes every day - I haven't seen the same things twice in the times I have been.A little on the pricey side, but you can forgive this for a small restaurant trying to make a living and turning out such lovely food.",Silver Pot
50,"We wanted to have a brunch at that place with a friend however we got there a little bit to late (breakfasts are till 12) so we decided to have a lunch. Lunch menu was full of interesting dishes and that menu changes every day. We had homemade hummus, beetroot bread with feta and pomegranate and two salads - with pomelo toasted nuts and pomegranates and second with green apple and Brie. Everything was really tasty. We have also tried freshly made juices which were also delicious.",Silver Pot
50,"We went to Silver Pot with limited sleep after a night out.Of course we wanted the best coffee and food cause we were really tired!The coffee is organic and amazing.Please try the open sandwich with scrabbled eggs and avocado.PS: I don't like pancakes, but still couldn't resist.That was the most amazing pancake of my life (blueberry pancake).Definitely is worth a visit. Keep up the good work ladies :)",Silver Pot
20,"went around 1pm with a friend, very full and overcrowded we had to sit at the outdoors bar, service was below average and distracted, the food was not anything special or unique, not worth the price (2 egg dishes & 2 juices = 25euros), overpriced for no reason.",Silver Pot
40,I have tried chocolate avocadoce tart and it I would never belived it can be so tasty. Coffee so good as I got used to in Cyprus. Staff very friendly!,Silver Pot
50,"The food here is always fresh and super tasty, the pancakes and the eggs are amazing. I always love coming here for brunch, and the staff is always so lovely even though they are always so full and people are desperate for a table. Definitely recommend!",Silver Pot
40,Ideal place for brunch and lunch . Gets extremely busy and sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to find a place . Very casual and friend atmosphere. Loved the salmon salad and French toast with berries,Silver Pot
50,"A Cozy little place, been there for ages but never tried before until now.Nice healthy options for those that like them and some not so healthy for the rest.Had a nice lazy Saturday brunch, everything was very tasty. Service was really good, considering that as the morning turns to noon it gets very crowded. I can understand that though as it's that good.",Silver Pot
50,"With an air of tasty hospitality Silver Pot makes you want to return and try anything you missed! Fluffy, fresh pancakes and a healthy portion of scrumbled eggs with whole grain toasts along with a bluemoon smoothie were our choices. Can't wait to come back!",Silver Pot
50,"If you're sick of the taverna food and meat overloads of Cyprus, this is the best place for you. Good friendly service; an interesting and diverse menu with gluten-free/vegetarian options; good poortion size; excellent coffee and cakes.",Silver Pot
20,"Visited the place for a brunch on a Sunday.The menu is carefully prepared to offer vegetarian and gluten free options,while always maintaining the facade of the hip place this is supposed to be.The restaurant wasn't well air conditioned,especially in the scorching cypriot weather.The staff was faceless and indifferent.Some plates were interesting,while others were quite ordinary and sub-par on the palate.The price tag was hefty.In my opinion,it falls short of all the hype",Silver Pot
20,"The food is nothing special at the silver pot. The eggs tasted so stale and has a consistency like plastic. The pancakes were not good either. The sandwich was the only thing that was good.At least the prices are not high.The service however, is terrible. I have never met a personell that was that rude and impassive.",Silver Pot
50,"Often visit for brunch or lunch, always great (I especially recommend anything that includes smoked salmon) and great for lunch take away too",Silver Pot
20,the food was average overall (nothing you couldn't do at home) however the service was so rude to my friends and I. We had reserved a table for 10 and they had given us a table for 5 and did not allow us to grab more chairs or join tables so we all had to squish. they were generally very dismissive and quick to judge based on our age (we are 17) even though we were extremely polite and civil towards them. Will NOT be visiting again and i do not recommend this place for people my age..,Silver Pot
50,I do it once every weekend.....best bfst. Service is a little but slow but it is fresh and excellent quality and quantity.,Silver Pot
50,"Having come over to Cyprus to visit my bestie and her new born she brought me to a place in the centre of Nicosia to eat.. and beat on mind she had the task of finding somewhere to cater for my vegan needs.. well this place does it. I was so impressed. Most of the food is vegetarian however tgey give you the option to twist to a vegan option which is what they did for me. The hummus is out of this world and tastes so light and fresh ..it is a must have. The avocado on grilled bread..goes without saying and as a main-you must try the baked aubergine because you will regret it if you don't. The staff there are so welcoming. They absolutely cater for your dietary needs and the ambience in the place is so chilled. I really cannot recommend this place enough. I want to take it back home with me. I'll be back hopefully In a couple of months and I know where I'll be heading-my new favourite vegan favourite chill out zone in cyprus. Perfect, harmonious and so cool.",Silver Pot
40,"Very nice menu with lots of different and healthy items on it, and the fresh mixed juice with ginger was tasty.",Silver Pot
50,"This is such a cute little restaurant in the newer part of Nicosia, serving fresh food, tasty and different to what you usually find. You have quite a big choice and is particularly good for vegetarians.It has a cosy and relaxed atmosphere and I recommend you book as it gets quite full.",Silver Pot
50,"You won't find a place like it in the whole island. Small, cozy, friendly place to eat, or drink coffee etc.Value for money considering the quality of food and IMHO best brunch in town. If you're a regular they season your food with extra love than usual.Half the dishes are for the day and half are constant. My favorite is the Salmon salad, served by Phaedra",Silver Pot
40,Good value. Excellent menu choices. Delicious food and coffee. A gem of a place in Nicosia. Friendly service,Silver Pot
50,Really fresh and creative food in here with vegan and vegetarian options. Would definitely recommend this restaurant but make sure you'll go early enough because the space is kinda small. I look forward to going back again and check on the specials.,Silver Pot
50,"During our two months in Nicosia, my husband and I regularly visited this cozy and charming cafe. The staff were welcoming, the seating was comfy, the cakes on offer were made on the premises and of excellent quality, and the loose leaf tea came in a teapot. Both the ginger cake and the chocolate cake were awesome.",Silver Pot
50,"Great food options, either for brunch or lunch. Sometimes it gets too busy but is definitely worth the wait.",Silver Pot
50,"Time and time again Silver Pot proves why it's one of the brunch places here to stay. Creative flavours sweet and savoury to satisfy all the environment is casual, kid friendly and inviting.",Silver Pot
50,Silver Pot is a very friendly place to go! The food is delicious and you have many choices for what to eat. The people there are very kind. It's very cosy and its decoration is really beautiful!,Silver Pot
40,Visited Silver Pot for brunch. The menu had a good selection and service and atmosphere was very good.,Silver Pot
40,"this place is a marvel in every respect: central location, wonderful staff, beautifully decorated, and its best feature: fantastic food!fresh, good quality, and multiple options for vegans and vegetarians. big thumbs up to all female staff. u ladies rule!",Silver Pot
50,"A veggie cafe, I had hummous and was given the recipe. Absolutely delicious, nice bread with it. Good loos. Their English was a bit limited, but we managed",Silver Pot
40,"Excellent place to have your brunch and coffee. The design makes you feel so comfy . The staff is really polite but the service it's quite late as the dishes need some time to be prepared ( we waited 25 minute for sure ) . I will recomend that you put less olive oil in your plates, to make them lighter. Large amount of quantity . The usual prices for brunch ( 10-15 euros ) . Make reservation !!!!",Silver Pot
40,Brunch here is great. Ingredients are fresh and food is tasty. Coffee is great too. Only downside is selection for brunch is small. Service is sometimes slow when busy but staff are friendly.,Silver Pot
30,"Nice atmosphere especially in site (airconditioned), kind personnel, the kitchen is not very flexible (they cook scrambled eggs but not boiled!) but it's better if you don't eat here. You will pay breakfast like buffet dinner at the Hilton!!!!",Silver Pot
40,"the food is nice and tasty depends on taste if you are half way i to healthy food. If you are vegan forget it as its not vegan friendly. The choices are good although they tend to be offering the same menu so if you go ince in a while its ok. Juices are too expensive, in a parellel street the juice shop offers fresh juices at half the price.",Silver Pot
40,"This is a great place to go out for breakfast or brunch. The food is fresh and delicious and the coffee strong. The service is great and the ladies who work there are very welcoming.We had a yoghurt granola bowl (the thickest, best yoghurt - wow!) and french toast with brie, bacon and maple syrup - YUM!Highly recommend.",Silver Pot
50,"Love this place... Simple A4 menu with meals of the day! Everything is fresh, it works with a local seasonal concept... Gluten free desserts... Conscious for all tastes... Whenever I am in Nicosia, this is one of my favourite culinary destinations!",Silver Pot
50,"Perfect meals! Open only on midday having every day a different menu. Menu consists of 2-3 meals which are very tasty, healthy and hearty.Need reservation for space and meals :)",Silver Pot
50,Food is homemade and this is why the dishes vary from day to day since there is a different meal of the day every time you visit. The place is ideal for brunch and lunch and the options are also very healthy. The place is also coasy and cute!,Silver Pot
20,Read a good review of this restaurant in the local press so decided to visit for lunch yesterday. When we called to make a reservation & ask for directions we were told to check the website! As this was not possible we drove to Nicosia & searched for it ourselves. Not impressed with the interior as tables too close together & chairs very uncomfortable. Seating was either plastic chairs without covering or cushions & as it was very hot in Nicosia yesterday -38C these were very uncomfortable..even with a/c. Other options were backless bench seats. Also music was much too loud. Washrooms were up a staircase which didn't have any handrail making them difficult to climb. Now to the food! I ordered the Tequila & Lime roasted chicken with an avocado salad. Looked good but chicken was very dry . My friend had the Tandoori chicken and said that it too was dry . We shared a fruit crumble for dessert & this was OK. We were really disappointed and will not be returning.,Silver Pot
30,"I love their food. Great pancakes, great eggs and fantastic healthy salads. And they give you water, though from the tap. Better than most places. I gave them 3 stars. Why? The food is great. The last two times I went there it was hot. They have an issue with air conditioning. Though we were moved to another table it did feel very awkward. And the service was not, never is, good. We place our order and then we are completely forgotten until it is dessert and coffee time or we ask for the check. We were out of water. One of our party of 4 wanted to order a drink and we could not get a server. And the place is small. Look our way occasionally!So, I am confused. I love the place. Yet I need to find another place that has great food and great pancakes, is a little cooler and has better service.",Silver Pot
40,"this is a small hip place in the town center. serves home made dishes. a good variety of egg dishes and quiches and granola and pancakes. didnt like their pizza pastry though. nice coffee, pleasant service.",Silver Pot
50,"Fresh great tasting food, relaxed atmosphere, reasonable prices and very friendly staff. It is a lovely place to have lunch and we'll be going back!",Silver Pot
40,"Both times we 've been were on saturday, and one would expect delays but it was ok both times. The food was very good, freshly prepared and of good quality and the atmosphere very cosy.A bit on the expensive side though! If a family of 4 went there for brunch, it would cost 45 euros minimum to have breakfast there! What is it with crazy prices in Cyprus!?",Silver Pot
40,"Visited this cafe with friends on a Friday morning. The decor, service and food was lovely. We were a party of 4 and we ordered breakfast. Two of my friends ordered an omelette you have a choice of 3 fillings. And my other friend and I had a toasted sandwich. As a vegetarian I chose the hummus,avocado, tomato on brown bread and my friends had the bacon sandwich. Everything was so yummy. The coffee was really good also. The total bill was ‚Ç¨31. The cafe is situated in the town centre. We will definitely be going again.",Silver Pot
30,"Great salads, lemonade and decor. Will be going back soon. It's good on rainy and sunny days. The Kisch is good.",Silver Pot
50,Had a wonderful family brunch on a Saturday. Make sure you get early enough to find a table or be patient! Make sure to try the wonderful blueberry pancake with cream! Absolutely amazing! Food and drinks are served by really nice and happy people making sure that all positive energy is passed to you!,Silver Pot
10,"It is the second time that I visited this place and again the same disappointment. The staff is unbelievably rude, the service is really really bad and the food is not special at all, one may appreciate it only if they are starving, although I am sure they will realize the poor quality right after the second bite!About the service, oh I don't even want to think of it! It took them around 40 minutes to get our order and then they needed one hour and a half to serve us breakfast. Actually we were five people and they served us separately! They first served the two of us and then we waited 10 minutes for the third, another 5 minutes for the fourth and 10 more minute for the fifth! Of course we weren't happy and asked them if something went wrong and they rudely answered that ""this is breakfast! Breakfast cannot be served at the same time for everyone!"" What did they mean?The best part though is that 5 minutes after the last serving, they asked us if we had a reservation and because we didn't have they asked us to leave within the next 30 minutes because they had a reservation for lunch! Because of the good company and the conversation we didn't realize that the 30-min deadline passed and all of a sudden they put a table next to ours and told us that the people that have reservation want to sit and that they will sit with us until we leave!If the food was good I would have given them two stars. But the food is nothing special, the menu is boring, the decoration pass√© and the chairs uncomfortable! My advise: just don't try it. It's a waste!",Silver Pot
10,"We walked in for a quick lunch stayed for an hour and walked out starving to say the least. We could have never thought that it would take so long for two sandwiches to be prepared.However the waitress informed us in the rudest manner i have ever come across that it is first come first served and we that we must be patient and not complain! I was shocked! We did not even complain. I just asked if the food would take much longer! The place was not even full, it was 2 oclock when we arrived and nobody was eating....I explained that we really had to go and offered to pay for a soft drink we shared, which i assumed it would have been on the house bearing in mind the delay.But no! she asked me for 1.50, i gave her a 2 euro coin and she almost kept the change too! Honestly this place might have a good reputation for nice food etc etc but when it comes to staff manners it definetely needs to work on it!",Silver Pot
50,"Service was excellent, staff was very friendly, menu choices were interesting and unique, homemade products, good sized portions, very reasonable prices, quality of food was outstanding, free wifi, very comfortable atmosphere and relaxing ambience. We would definitely return when we are in town. Great place.",Silver Pot
50,"A brunch is not expected to be a culinary experience. The Silver Pot however ticks all the boxes. Very cosy atmosphere. Great service. Menu was quite extensive, taking into account that the menu here is limited and this is just brunch. Everything we tried was very well done. I was impressed by my leek and Parmesan quiche and the hoummous. I would have been happier with a small wine list ( what was on offer was only individual wine bottles of modest quality). But this does not take away from a great experience.",Silver Pot
40,"Have visited this place a few times for lunch and every time the food is excellent. Staff is friendly, ambience and music is good. It is one of the few places in nicosia that the quality of food is consistent. Interesting cuisine with an asian twist.",Silver Pot
50,We had a great breakfast and a chance to cool down a bit (it was +38 in Nicosia that day). People working there were extremely nice and helpful! The food was great too!,Silver Pot
40,An easy going place for lunch where you can get organic food and home made dishes. Everything is fresh from the day and perfect for an healthy midday break.,Silver Pot
40,"I have been there for brunch on a Saturday morning. Food was very tasty, service was excellent, reasonable prices and nice decoration. The menu is updated every week, with many constant options and some new additions each time. I will definitely return to try more dishes!!",Silver Pot
50,Perfect place for nice coffee and homemade pastries. Œ§hat we tested so far mostly sweets which were fresh and homemade.You need a reservation before you go.,Silver Pot
40,"The place is very cozy, the waitress is very nice and the menu is very simple! The food was really good especially the salmon salad.",Silver Pot
50,"We love this place! Small, excellent quality and friendly. I only wish they remain small as that is what I love about them. Don't miss the kish.",Silver Pot
50,Nice restaurant where one can enjoy brunch or lunch. The owners open in the morning with breakfast/brunch and continue until the early afternoon hours with light lunch.,Silver Pot
50,"Everything at Silver Pot is fresh, delicious and creative. It is our favourite lunch place in Nicosia.",Silver Pot
30,"Good selection for breakfast/brunch on Saturday mornings/early afternoons. The food is good, but the coffee is average. The service is decent and the prices are kind of high for what you get.",Silver Pot
50,"Nice polite and helpful staff, good choices, variable menu. Good quality dishes made fresh everyday. Prices ok at about 15eur a person max. Simple yet great. Breakfast and lunch its the best choice out there for the health concious in nicosia.",Silver Pot
50,My favorite Breakfast Pot. Granola is the best in Nicosia. Good atmosphere and very helpful staffüòâ. Lovely place üòâüòâüòâ,Silver Pot
