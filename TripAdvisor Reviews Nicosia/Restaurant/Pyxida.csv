40,Recommended for its fish soup! Must try! The service is always great and if you get to go in the summer it’s also lovely to sit in their back yard! slightly pricey but quality is worth it ! Steady quality and service all year round over the years!,Pyxida
30,"We arrived without a reservation, early on in the week and very early in the evening when the restaurant was empty and we were easily accommodated though almost grudgingly. There was no menu but a QR code to scan - luckily we could work it out ourselves as there was no help or offer of help from a member of staff.We were offered the drinks but never asked again if we wanted more drinks. The food arrived quickly and it was fantastic, delicious and plentiful - we were very impressed.However we felt the service was surly and unfriendly and geared towards regulars who knew what to order. As much as we loved the food I would think it would be very unlikely we return and not accommodating for children, as with no childs menu or smaller size option, the portion size is too large for a young person.",Pyxida
40,"Even though it is always a busy place, especially for lunch, I much enjoy their food either take away or sit in. Their fish soup is the best in Cyprus, their service is just impeccable and their food fresh and tasty every time I go! Lasting value in business and non- business places to eat!",Pyxida
10,Very disappointed with the service of Pyxida in Limassol. Very rude personnel to the point that we had to leave the restaurant and they did not even care. The waiter was very abrupt and he was not in the mood to take our order despite the fact that the place was empty. Pyxida used to be one of the good see food places. I am not sure why Limassol marina branch was so bad. Worse experience I had in Cyprus so far.. Very sorry..,Pyxida
50,Very good variety of fish and very skilfully coked. I recommend the fishsoup. At times it feels like a place for business meals but families visit the place too.,Pyxida
10,"Our 2nd visit and unfortunately it will be our last. At our 1st visit the food was amazing but staff not very friendly. It was a busy night but still the staff did not speak to us once after our meze order was taken. As it was a fish meze it would have been nice if we were told what exact type of fish was. We thought we would give it another try this weekend but the service was absolutely terrible. We were made to feel as though we were a hindrance even though we had booked a table. Apart from taking the order not one member of staff spoke to us until we asked for the bill. Even then it was a nod of the head, not even a good bye or thank you as we left.",Pyxida
40,Good ( not the best) quality. Also overpriced since many dishes are just fried ones. Great service though,Pyxida
50,"The place is clean, the staff is very kind and helpful, the food is good, especially the soup, which is perfect. The service and the overall atmosphere is perfect. When you order a fish meze, is not so expensive and with meze you can have different kind of fish and also a very nice sweet at the end.",Pyxida
40,"there was a good fish menu different from a traditional fish meze menu(eg croquet) but not much better than other fish meze restaurants, so kind of a rip off for the price, however it's in Nicosia. The food was good.",Pyxida
40,A Very good fish restaurant in the heart of the city. Very good quality and service. On the expensive side thought.,Pyxida
50,"Very nice atmospher, delicious fresh fish and very attentive waiters! We went in the summer time and we were on the veranda which was cool enough!",Pyxida
40,"Excellent foot, staff was very professional but the price are a bit high. Is one if the best restaurant in Nicosia",Pyxida
40,It is not the first that I visited this place. this time the food was good but not as tasty as usual. The grilled fish was tasty and fresh but some of the small dishes of fish meze was not so good. The price of the fish meze was around 26 euro per person. The service was good but not excellent as usual...!,Pyxida
40,"Excellent food as always, very good service. Classic perfection. Consistency in food quality. A restaurant for special occasions and business.",Pyxida
50,"Excellent to everything! We are visiting Pyxida, Nicosia, once a week for lunch. Congratulations to then. Very high standards!",Pyxida
50,A very classy fish restaurant in the heart of nicosia. Serving quality sea food at reasonable enough prices. Professional service elegant dining and excellent quality.,Pyxida
30,We had the meze. Too many fried foods; so many dishes but mostly fried. Its time for a change; people nowadays want simpler and healthier dishes not loaded in calories. Fruits and sweets are always excellent here and homemade by mrs Katina,Pyxida
50,"Pixida is definitely my go-to favourite for fine fishy dining. The welcome is always warm, the service always friendly and highly professional (always ask for their recommendations) and the standard has remained consistently excellent since I started eating at Pixida in its former location in the 1990s.For those who don't have the stomach for the abundance of the full mezze, the delicious salads, fish and/or seafood make an unforgettable meal.Go when you have time to enjoy the ambience, don't rush. It's a lovely place to be and diners are in very capable and experienced hands.",Pyxida
50,I have never been disappointed... always fresh and tasty fish. The service perfect and the waiters so polite and helpful. I recommend highly this place mainly if you like sea foods.,Pyxida
50,Good atmosphere with good service. Probably the best fish soup in Cyprus! A bit overpriced but best option in Nicosia for fish meze,Pyxida
40,"I ate here in late September 2019. I arrived one hour before their lunch closing an grabbed a seat just walking in. Most persons had reservations, and I recommend you make one.I ordered fried sand smelt with potatoes, a Greek salad, and octopus in vinegar with a Boutari white wine. All of the food was excellent, though the salad was a little pedestrian.The dining room I was seated in was nicely appointed and table were covered with white linen clothes. The staff was attentive and I did not feel as if I was getting the closing-hour treatment.I wish I could have gone back for dinner.",Pyxida
30,"We were two people. Ordered a salad (had not enough oil) tarama, taxini. We also ordered started four grilled red mullet (0,5kg) that came late and finally a small grilled fish (vlachos at exactly 1 kilo, surprise surprise) at EUR120.",Pyxida
30,"We visited Pyxida with business guests for dinner. A very nice atmosphere despite being crowded and the manager very welcoming and professional.Nice starters and main (all fish of course!) and a good selection of wines to go with the food.Overall a nice evening but future guests should know this is no budget restaurant, all the opposite....",Pyxida
50,It is the best fish restaurant in Nicosia and Limassol. very fresh food. very nice atmosphere. best dishes.,Pyxida
40,I had a dinner with my family few days ago.The service was very good and the restaurant interior was warm and welcoming. We had fish meze and wine.Wonderful experience. All fresh !!! I recommend it. .,Pyxida
50,"Possibly the best first tavern in Nicosia. Fresh fish! Expensive, but fresh fish in Cyprus is pricey anyway, but service and food quality are the best!",Pyxida
50,Everything is perfect in this email and I have been never disappointed. The fish is always tasty and fresh and all kind if small fish dishes are absolutely delicious too. The service is good sometimes few delays. I highly recommend it.,Pyxida
50,"Late in the night, after a stressing working day, we had no time neither wish to look for a restaurant by ourselves. I ask the suggestion to the taxi driver for a restaurant close to our hotel, Cleopatra. I have to thank him 10 times! Very good suggestion! Fantastic fish restaurant. We tasted the rich starter, then a grilled fish, choosen by us in an hoc stand. Rich list of local and Greek wines.Recommended! Not very cheap but in line with the quality of the offered menù and professional service!",Pyxida
50,"This has got to be one of the best fish restaurants on the island. We had the mezedhes - a selection of fish entrées each one a delight, each cooked to perfection. The main problem with ordering mezedhes was there was just too much to eat and that with the high price tag made it an expensive night out, However, I will be going again. The place is nothing to look at but the staff were attentive and congenial.",Pyxida
40,Really nice restaurant. The fish is really nice. Great for families and business meetings. It’s a good choice for special occasions.,Pyxida
30,"I've only been there twice with work cause they were buying us dinner, wouldn't go again myself.In general the restaurant has an amazing atmosphere, excellent service and everything looks elegant. If you want to impress and don't mind the bill, this is a good place to do it.Food quality both times was average with the exception of a huge fish they brought at the end. I mean fried Molluscs tastes the same where ever you go but they cost way more here. Not sure if there were grilled options since our boss picked the food.",Pyxida
40,Excellent staff. The food was enough but there was not in it something to justify the somewhat higher prices compared to other fish restaurants. The place is very nice clean and in good order.,Pyxida
50,Lots and lots of seafood. Impossible to leave this with an empty stomach :) you might need to make a reservation as it is very popular.,Pyxida
50,"The range, quality and quantity of fish at this lovely, great value restaurant is astonishing. Don’t eat lunch and go slowly on the opening barrage because this is a fish feast that keeps on giving.What the toy fish in the indoor tank think of this extravaganza, is anybody’s guess!",Pyxida
50,"Visited for a business dinner, and was, once again, left very satisfied. Fish is always fresh and tasteful. The speed of the food brought is great. Not too quick to rash you and not too slow to forget what you are eating! Even the fruit and desert are amazing! Highly recommended!!",Pyxida
50,"The dishes are nice and well presented, tasty food, its expensive but you won't get disappointed. Fish Meze",Pyxida
50,Great service friendly staff the food is delicious . they have fresh fish and sea food . highly recommended and a must visit place,Pyxida
50,"This restaurant may sound like “yet another fish tavern at the seafront, in Larnaca.” However, Pyxida Seafood Restaurant is anything but! This said, it makes the difference! It is , by far, the best seafood restaurant in the area.My husband and I booked a table for two inside the fully air-conditioned dining-room as it was too hot to sit outside on a hot Sunday in June. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by the friendly staff. A very elegant lady showed us to our table and soon afterwards I noticed the great decor in earthy colours – brown, beige, shades of grey and blue. I also noticed that the restaurant was filling up quickly considering it was only 01:00 pm. In Cyprus, Sunday lunch usually starts well after 02:00 pm.For starters, we had a Greek salad, taramosalata (fish roe salad) which came with freshly baked toasted bread. We loved the texture, the smell and the taste and I felt it was homemade taramosalata. We also had grilled octopus which was divine! Never before have I tasted such tender and tasty octopus!The main course – lavraki (baked seabass) – was cleaned and served at our table garnished with baked eggplant, spinach and cauliflower and very special French fries! Thickly cut and aromatic! Oh yes ! And so crispy!We were about to decline the special treat on the house – mini “baklava” served with mastic ice cream – thank God we changed our mind!No sooner had we finished our meal than we started planning our next visit to Pyxida in Larnaca",Pyxida
50,"The mezze at Pyxida is amazing and the food is lovely. The samll dishes are served as they come out of the kitchen, so you are guaranteed if a steam of food coming over. Great ice cream follows as a dessert. We really enjoyed our time there and the price is within a reasonable range for the quality of the food served.",Pyxida
40,I was invited for a business diner. We had the fish meze it was just delicious and never ending. Perfect service nice decor. I would love to go again.,Pyxida
40,"The atmosphere was great. Meze selection was very interesting, but a little too much fried. Main courses were great",Pyxida
50,Nice reputable place to eat see food. The reputation owe to the years of best work with excellent quality of food with variety at it best. Good service nice atmosphere and good people. There's a parking place which is nice for Nicosia,Pyxida
50,Had dinner here on my first night in Nicosia. The food kept on coming and we had many varieties of fresh and tasty fish. An excellent place for dinner,Pyxida
40,"We choose to be seated inside as is fully airconditioned and we choose to take meze for 4 persons including beers, water, sweets and coffee. Food was very good and tasty, service was excellent and quick, prices good. We paid 120 euros.We enjoyed it and we will go again !",Pyxida
40,"Very clean, very fresh fish, very tasty starters, very nice staff. I was there at least 10 times the last 3 years and I was always very satisfied.",Pyxida
50,"I have never been disappointed ... always the fish is fresh, well cooked and tasty. the service was good too. The range of prices higher than other places but comparing to quality of food you get ..it is excellent! I highly recommend this place.",Pyxida

40,"One of the best restaurants in Nicosia. Good and usually friendly service, good atmosphere, free parking, nice food.",Pyxida
40,Great fish tavern. I love the fish soup. Clean with great service. Try the fish meze. You shoukd try it,Pyxida
40,"""The"" fish restaurant in Nicosia. I am visiting it with family or friends or for business since more than 12 years.

40,Always fresh fish very well cooked great service reasonable price. Every time I go to pixida with some new comers from Italy they are very satisfied,Pyxida
40,I went several times to this time and I was never disappointed. The service always good and quick and the fish always fresh and tasty. No more to stay except it is a place that everyone should visit. Highly recommended. The only negative is that no interesting view ; normal since you are in the capital !,Pyxida
50,Pyxida is one of my favorite restaurant in Nicosia! Foods are fresh and tasty. Restaurant provides good service to their customers.,Pyxida
50,I visited Pyxida with business associates and had excellent fresh fish variety. The service was outstanding and the prices very reasonable for the quality you get.,Pyxida
40,"It's a well fish specialist restaurant. In Nicosia and also in Limassol Marina. Many good choices mainly for fish, meat also, friendly service. If you are a big company, take care sometimes they delayed and/or do mistakes...",Pyxida
50,Excellent food and service. Been here many years ago and yesterday. The restaurant keeps the level high.,Pyxida
40,"This is undoubtedly a fine quality fish tavern. I would suggest the ""fish meze"" which amounts to a variety of dishes, both delicious and (over-)filling.The price is a little high, compared to a couple of other fish taverns in Nicosia which are of similar quality, but it is still rather well-contained when comparing to Western European fish restaurants.",Pyxida
50,"Probably the best fish restaurant on the island even though it is situated in the capital Nicosia which is in the centreFresh fish carefully cooked , with delicious starters typically Greek such as Tarama , taxini and salad with fresh vegetables.Excellent service , best local wines and traditional Greek sweets. It could easily be Michele star if it cared to be.",Pyxida
50,Great food variety. Try the meze to get the full experience that the restaurant has to offer. Must visit when in Nicosia,Pyxida
40,Food is always great here. Fresh fish . Nice fish soup. Service is good . The place is nice to sit and have a meal. Not noisy .,Pyxida
50,Definitely a restaurant that your guests from abroad will be impressed. A bit pricey but quality matches the price. Recommended.,Pyxida
40,A very good and nice restaurant. The food is good but the prices are a bit expensive. It is nice to 7visit every while and then but it is not affortable for everyone.,Pyxida
40,"We were here for lunch and it is not one of the cheapest restaurants of course. Pyxida is based in an old house and it is popular for its fish mezze. I still remember the tasty fish soup and the 'Barbouni' fish out of many more after all these months! Friendly atmosphere, great service.",Pyxida
50,They are professionals in what they do. They price themselves very expensive but they are always busy. Very good food!,Pyxida
40,"It’s definitely the best fish place in nicosia Nice environment as it’s hosted in an old house Fresh fish, excellent fish soup Always well cooked dishes Never disappointed, visited many times",Pyxida
40,Nice atmosphere. Food fressh and well prepared. Quite tasty. Service was a bit amateurish but otherwise good. It was a busy night so I can understand that they were short handed. Excellent seafood however,Pyxida
50,Very nice place with excellent food and service i suggest you to visit and enjoy fresh fish and delicious plates.,Pyxida
50,"I am a regular for years! Food always fresh, love the staff and owner! Excellent! Best service ‘ my favorite restaurant",Pyxida
50,"Very warm atmosphere, very friendly staff! The food was excellent with good portions. Definitely recommended!",Pyxida
30,Average food. Some fish were not fresh. Very expensive restaurant for the quality food that serves. Put they are very professional table service,Pyxida
30,"Dinner for two....perfectly pleasant, good fresh fish and quite helpful service. The setting isn’t particularly special and I was a little surprised that this was viewed as one of the best restaurants.",Pyxida
50,"I’ve been many times to Pyxida for the past 4 years and every time I’ve been impressed. This time we took the fish menu and at 25 euros it’s a steal. We got 17 plates 15 of them are seafood based. You get pretty much everything (mussels, shrimp, squid, different fish fried or grilled) and it’s all delicious. My favorite has to be their fish croquettes, their fried red mullet (the best fish ever) and their mussels. To accompany the feast, we ordered 1 liter of house wine at 15 euros which is a pretty good price. I highly recommend this place. Some people complained about the service but we had an excellent service.",Pyxida
50,"This restaurant you can trust! Always good! Fresh food, professional service, good atmosphere and parking)) that important in Nicosia Time will not change Pyxida! Thank you!",Pyxida

50,"Lovely place for seafood lovers , for lunch or dinner, to satisfy all tastes. Friendly , casual atmosphere .",Pyxida
50,"A quiet place just at the city center. Great for business and, at the same time, family meals. A little expensive but the excellent quality of the food and the friendly service overcomes the high cost.One of the best fish restaurants I've ever visited. I recommend it.",Pyxida
50,I usually go with my family and we prefer to order « fish meze» because the variety of the food they offer with the meze is amazing! It is better to make a reservation before you go. It’s a bit expensive but it’s worth it!,Pyxida
50,"We wanted some good Cypriot food away from the ledra street places and found Pyxida recommended by the daily telegraph. We were not disappointed . Helpful staff to select our fish and wine . We had the Greek and tomato salads both super fresh with Tara and olives. The sea bass was perfect plus calamari and small mullet. Then complimentary ice cream and cyprus pastry . 25 euros a head may be a little more than average but still very good value for the quality of food plus wine and beer. Only small criticism was the taramasalata should have had a stronger taste, was quiet bland but am being picky .",Pyxida
30,This restaurant is good but not value for money. Is extremely expensive. You can find any other fish restaurants in Nicosia with 25% less on the price,Pyxida
50,"2nd time now at the pixida.This place is really good.The service is great and the fish it self top top quality.We went for the meze. And unlike most other fish restaurants that rudely ad so many cheap processed dishes, pixida only has real fresh fish dishes at very reasonable prices.Beautiful restaurant will be back again",Pyxida
40,"we had shrimps, octopus, fish, fish filet, everything was perfect. Service was good, but not too enthusiastic though.",Pyxida
20,"that is it. Pricy restaurant for what it offers. I paid 75€ for a platter of fried calamares, half of seabrass (whic was top and above 500 grams), salad, two glasses of white house wine, a coffee and a very small amaretto.It is a factory, with a large overhead cost (many waiters, pushing to order more).I prefer a small fish resraurant, with honest prices.Congrats to the chef for grilling the fish !",Pyxida
40,"the food was delicious, fish was well cooked and good quality. the service was very good, the environment nice, nice restaurant.",Pyxida
50,Excellent food and service I have been going there for years and service has not changed. The outside garden area in the summer is fantastic and most of all it's very clean.,Pyxida
40,The service is excellent in both restaurants (Nicosia and Limassol) and the fish meze has a big variety of fish dishes. The location at Marina Limassol is excellent.,Pyxida
50,Excellent: Location Marina Limassol Food Service To improve: Pricing Overall 9/10. -------------------,Pyxida
50,"Nice outdoor veranha. Very good service. The food and wine are excellent. Try the fish meze, which includes a variety of fish dishes, and is really made of fresh fish. The course starts with the most tastier fishsoup!",Pyxida
50,A great restaurant that catered for 12 people on a business dinner. The service was excellent. The pescatarians very much enjoyed the seafood. The vegetarians were very well catered for.,Pyxida
50,"Recently been there with my family, the food was rated with 10 stars! Service was excellent Quality was excellent!",Pyxida
50,"The fish meze is excellent, huge variety and delicious! Friendly staff and very fast and efficient service.",Pyxida
40,"Whenever I fancy fish for dinner in a nice restaurant that has no fishy smell, then Pyxida is the answer in the middle of the town. The food is nice, the atmosphere is very civilised and the service is good. One should try the cod on the grill, or the octapous. The toasted bread, the grilled black olives or even the grilled marrows are all accompanyinng delicacies. However, coming to pay the bill, you have to be prepared to either have your credit card or a respectable amount of money! Is it worth it? Go for it if you fancy it!",Pyxida
50,"The food is great, they know who to cook fish perfectly! The outside seating area in the summer is really pleasant. The service is very professional.",Pyxida
40,Nice food but extremely overpriced. Staff very friendly. We had the fish soup (portion was tiny) and fish.,Pyxida
50,"Came here for lunch after a day in Nicosia.Well received, well cared for and very, very good food.The small portion of octopus was the best I have ever tasted - can you imagine soft, fluffy, grilled octopus ?.. absolutely divine !So much crab in a crab salad... you don't see too much crab in Cyprus.Personally, I would have preferred the chips to be a little more crispy but, I ate them all so take that with a pinch of salt.Complimentary coffee and desserts = very impressed !!!",Pyxida
50,We've been here on a business lunch but we were really enjoying the huge range of seafood. All dishes are made from fresh catch so you can be sure to get the best for your money.,Pyxida
40,"This is the best place to eat fish in Nicosia. It’s expensive but if you are a seafood lover, this is the best place to be!",Pyxida
40,We were a group of 10 adults and a child and we have ordered 7 fish meze.More than enough with a lot of leftover food for the cats .Quite nicely presented ;service ok .Good relaxing environment ;found the drink prices more expensive than other fish restaurants in Nicosia and of course the fish meze price 25 euros is more expensive than other fish restaurants in Nicosia .For me the price was not the issue . It seems to be a little more posh than the other competive restaurants .Good location in the center with a free parking place.,Pyxida
40,The maturity in running a top restaurant is so evident. Very professional people serving excellent food. You will be impressed - do try,Pyxida
50,"Amazing place! Always fresh dishes in this restaurant, very tasty sea food, come back again always !",Pyxida

50,This restaurant is very nice and of high quality food. The atmosphere is great and the service is perfect.,Pyxida
50,"This restarant located is city center . There was a nice garden . Nice team, perfect very delicious meal and good local wine .",Pyxida
40,I went several times to this time and I was never disappointed. The service always good and quick and the fish always fresh and tasty. No more to stay except it is a place that everyone should visit. Highly recommended. The only negative is that no interesting view ; normal since you are in the capital !,Pyxida
40,"My husband, daughter, and I went here for a celebration. My husband had eaten here before, and raved about the food. Indeed, the seafood was very tasty, and most of it was very well cooked. However, some things, like the shrimp (prawns, actually) were not hot and were greasy. It was a struggle to eat them, as they weren't thoroughly shelled. Then, when we saw the price, it was a shock. Very expensive.",Pyxida
50,"Very good service with excellent food ! Traditional anbiance of a fish restaurant ,get ready though to pay for what you get !",Pyxida
50,"Have visited several times, always they impress with their quality of service and food. Is always fresh and delicious.",Pyxida
50,Pyxida is and alsways will be an excellent choice to eat fresh fish in a nice environment!!! Well done!!!,Pyxida
40,"Great service and food, always make a reservation. A little expensive, but excellent quality. The ambiance is not my favourite, mainly attracts business /corporate people enyertaining clients.",Pyxida
40,"I spent an evening at the Pyxida restaurant with a friend. The environment is extremely friendly and the service impressive, very good. We eat a tasti hallow i and then a sea food spaghetti dish which was very good, please consider I’m Italian too and quite esigente in terms of pasta quality.The restaurant I very good also in terms of price-service and quality offered.Absolutely recommended also for family with kids.",Pyxida
50,"Plenty of food, pleasant atmosphere, quality food and good service. Even have it's own parking places.",Pyxida
50,This place is a must visit place if you want to eat the best fish soup in Cyprus. The prices are a bit above the average but it is worth it.,Pyxida
50,I enjoyed everything we had ordered from the oysters all the way to the sweet. Fish was cooked perfectly and the meze were very tasty. I highly recommend it.,Pyxida
40,"it offers fresh fish in the center of Nicosia.Will i be going again? Probably not because a restaurant is not just the food.With that price tag, i expect a better atmosphere and different (either classy or modern) design. As it stands, it reminds me of a house.Since 1)CY is surrounded by the Med and 2) the restaurant does not deliver the ""A star factor"", I prefer to travel 30-40 minutes and have my grouper by the coast.A renovation will certainly elevate this place.",Pyxida
50,"I have visited this fish tavern with colleagues as well as with family! We have ordered both times meze accompanying with white local wine! Every time that I have visited this restaurant was perfect! Service was excellent, the food fresh cooked and wine on the right temperature!It is strongly recommended for any occasion even for business lunch!",Pyxida
20,"-食物好吃但是服務品質參差不齊，如果想品嚐道地食物倒也不必特地花大錢受氣。我男友先進門想問是否有位子結果竟然有個高壯女不但沒有上前迎接甚至站在那用不客氣的眼神在打量我男友像是覺得我們吃不起吧，超憤怒失去理智到想罵人再問是否該店刷金卡不夠格要黑卡才可以各種失控台詞，最後被淡定男友安撫還有另一位態度好的服務員熄火- Les plats sont bons et la service est plutôt moyen. On croit bien que c’est plutôt un resto pour les riches et les bobos locaux mais pas pour les étrangers surtout si t’es touriste au lieu d’être en mode voyage d’affaire.- My partner and I were here for business trip but after conference we changed to casual outfits (shorts and sneakers) and we got some plastic bags in hands after a small city tour — these might be improper for this high-class restaurant which looks like a family type one. And I guess so, in the beginning a waitress didn’t receive him but looked him from head to feet and looked up and down again and again for at least three times. How rude, and sorry to say so but, even disgusting! If it’s because of outfits, as foreigners we didn’t notice that it’s actually a high class restaurant and you could have told us that unfortunately it’s not very suitable for tourists who just want to taste good local cuisine or whatever. I’d like just to suggest you be more professional.",Pyxida
50,By far the best fish restaurant in CYPRUS!!! Had a delicious dinner in a great atmosphere! Great service!,Pyxida
50,"I was brought here by local colleagues who frequent it regularly. Great spread of food, attentive service. Calamari, red mullet, seabream, tuna tartar - all fantastic",Pyxida
50,"You go there if you have an occasion, business or personal/family, sit down inside or outside (winter or summer) to enjoy fish. Just choose from the day's catch and will be rewarded amply with your main course plus anything else you pick for your starters. Never tried dessert in the winter so can't say anything about it but in the summer the plate of fresh fruits was as expected.",Pyxida
30,"Quality of food and service is generally good, but if you order anything outside fish meze you are sure to be slaughtered with unjustified high prices!! Sorry guys but this is the truth........",Pyxida
40,"very nice restaurant, good service, very clean, good food and nice fish meze, there are some very good dishes the prices are high",Pyxida
10,"Expensive and overrated. average food, average ambiance, average service. Go there only if you are on a company tap.",Pyxida
50,This is the best fish restaurant in nicosia. Friendly people excellent food fresh fish and a very helpful car park in a busy location.,Pyxida
50,"Super seafood meze, good drinks, and good, professional service. Can be a bit noisy and hectic, but the wait staff still took good care of us. I've eaten here several times and never regretted it.",Pyxida
50,"I had a very good lunch over there.Great service, very attentive. We had excellent grilled octopus, some great grilled calamari and very good fish. Well prepared, soft and tasty.I recommend though be prepared for the relatively (compering to other places in Nicosia) high pricing",Pyxida
40,"Pixida offers an excellent fish menu , with excellent service . Nevertheless I find it to be overpriced",Pyxida
40,"Pyxida has achieved a certain consistency. The quality is good, the service is excellent and the surroundings are pleasant. However for me it is a victim of its own success. It has become overcrowded as it is frequented by all - business, family, friends, couples. And there is a sense of deja vu. Both in people spotting and in the menu. There haven’t been any changes in the menu (you might argue why mess with a successful recipe - now repeated in Limassol) or at least any recommendations in this direction. Maybe that is what Yiannos is receiving from his regulars, so that is what he offers.",Pyxida
50,"Fresh sea food, an amazing soup and fast service. All in the heart of the capital Nicosia. Not expensive and a friendly environment.",Pyxida
40,"Excellent meal, good environment very good service. Overall a positive atmosphere which made us all feel comfortable.",Pyxida

50,"Delivers quality sea food dishes consistently.Not a surprise that even Cypriots opt to often eat sea food at this venue v on the coast since taste, service and quality are often much higher though miss the charm of a coastal fish restaurant.Bit pricey but you get good value for money.",Pyxida
50,"Due to business reasons I was travelling to Nicosia several times within the last six months. One of my favorites as the Pyxida Fish Tavern, which is known one of the best for the money in town. Crowds are as sure as the tide, so don't forget to make Reservation.",Pyxida
30,"We've tried fish meze and most of the dishes was good, but there were also big amount of fried (like deep fryers) variety of dishes and they weren't tasty.

50,"Cyprus is well known for its fish restaurants and you can therefore find a lot of fish restaurants and taverns serving fish. Pyxida is no doubt the best I have been to. It’s not my first time there given the quality. It serves a wide variety of fishes from very small sardines to big sea bass and more. It comes with steamed vegetables and some olive oil and I usually have some chips (who are great) and some Greek and other salads. Service is great and prices are affordable when compared to similar quality restaurants across Europe. Great experience, great food, can’t wait to go back to Pyxida.",Pyxida
50,What a fabulous fish restaurant. Taken by surprise. The food was fresh and the service was excellent. Will definitely be back. Thanks guys. Mr G,Pyxida
40,"We ate there twice. Dinner the first night was ordered for us as a large selection of Mezes, of which we really liked the grilled vegetables, salad, octopus, shrimp, grilled calamari. the dips were fine, but not outstanding. The fish we had with it at the end was very nice, light and easily eaten after all the other stuff.The second night we ordered from menu and were not as pleased, probably did not make best choices, and they were very busy so service was rather hit or miss. The coffee at the end was great, and my wife liked her dessert, like a flan as I recall. The restaurant is not far outside the old town in an area of hotels and bigger buildings. It is quite popular, we had trouble getting a table on a Friday, make a reservation. sitting outside is very nice, but can be cool if windy.",Pyxida
30,"I attended with colleagues who eat fish and they loved it. Staff are good and food is served quickly. Salads are gorgeous, veggie option is not brilliant but it does not claim to be. Dessert was delicious.",Pyxida
40,A good place for seafood in mainland. Probably the best place foe seafood in the capital. It is very good place for a business meal.,Pyxida
50,"Last night we were at pyxida fish restaurant. As always professionalism is obvious. Food was excellent ,quick service and relaxing atmosphere.",Pyxida
50,"We sat outdoors because the night weather was lovely. The setting was very romantic. Staff was swift, friendly and attending. The fish meze was excellent, each dish better than the one before, regardless that most of it was fried. The price is a bit aversive but for a random visit it’s excellent. A+",Pyxida
40,"The restaurant has very good and fresh fish, the service is very good, the waiters are quick and very efficient.",Pyxida
50,"Bit pricey but it is worth every penny. I'd advise reserving a table in advance. Great taste, fresh fish and good service",Pyxida
50,The best fish restaurant in nicosia . Professional stuff and very high standards for food . Strongly recommended,Pyxida
40,"Very good service on weekdays, very busy on weekends especially Sundays. Good quality but too expensive. Variety and definitly fresh fish",Pyxida
50,A buzzing very popular fish restaurant in Nicosia. Quality of food excellent with a good wine list. Finished off with great backlava and mastiha ice cream - fabulous.,Pyxida
40,"Nice restaurant serving fresh fish, good and quick service, perfect place for business lunch. Serve nice sweet at the end as well.",Pyxida
50,Probably the best fish restaurant in Nicosia . Always excellent fresh fish expertly cooked . The owner Yiannos is around to welcome you knowing regulars by name and makes you feel at home. They also have a restaurant at Limassol marina which equally excellent! Highly recommended!,Pyxida
50,"We have eaten here a number of times. Food is excellent. Service is good. The ambience is not great, but who cares when the fish is this good. I consider this the best place for seafood in Nicosia, and one of the best on the island.",Pyxida
50,"The place is really nice, has a great atmosphere, the fish was very tasty. The service was a bit slow, but it didn't spoil the experience.",Pyxida
50,It was a really great evening in Pyxida as the restaurant has high standards. The food was delicious and well-presented. The service and the atmosphere are also pleasant. The staff are friendly and talkative. The price is reasonable. In my opinion it's one of the best restaurants we ate in Cyprus.Would highly recommend.Ps: the sugar-bowl is so pretty.,Pyxida
50,"We enjoyed a delicious lunch at Pyxida on our first day in Nicosia. The seafood was fresh, the wine was good and the service was friendly.",Pyxida
30,"We ordered starters and grilled fish a la carte, and the quality was indeed excellent. The fish was fresh, well cooked and served the right time - possibly the best quality in Nicosia. The service though was not exactly on the same level. The feeling was that ""they were making us a favour"" by having us in their restaurant. No smiles, no greetings and a kind of hastly service all the way, especially during the wine selection. Given the restaurant reputation and the high range price you would definitely expect a more attentive and customer-focused experience.",Pyxida
40,"The fish here was delicious and really well prepared. The service was great and we were well advised on the wine. The setting is stylish and comfortable and, despite the reviews saying it is overpriced, I found the bill to be very reasonable for the meal we had.",Pyxida
40,"The food it was very good and the place outside it was very nice. Good tasty fishes in fish meze choice.However i think is highly priced, maybe it could lower their prices especially for fish meze. In addition it could add 1 or 2 additional accompanying dishes like rice or potatoes. It has a variety of fishes and with this addition it could be perfect.",Pyxida
50,"If you are looking for the best fish or seafood in town then Pyxida is the most obvious choice. All dishes are always fresh, cooked to perfection and service is really good. Go for the fresh fish from the display, try the blue tuna tartare (if you are lucky to find some), oysters, mussels, lobster pasta and some of the seafood salads. Wine list is not extensive, however includes all the major local labels, some good Greek and also some French and Italian. The place is expensive but worths every penny spent there.",Pyxida
50,Maybe the best fish restaurant in the capital Nicosia. Specializes in fish dishes and not only. Excellent service.You can go a la card or set menu.You can choose fresh fish and pay by weight.All kind of drinks are provided.One of the restaurants that the Cyprus Tourism Organization uses for VIP guests.,Pyxida
40,"We were taken here for dinner on a Saturday night by friends who live in Nicosia. They take all their visitors here, so some of the staff seemed to recognise them and welcomed them back. It is a very relaxed place, even though listed as one of the best restaurants in Nicosia, and like everywhere else it is not in the slightest bit smart.We sat outside, the place was very busy, but we had booked.We had some food to share for both courses. Tuna carpaccio, grilled calamari and tarama (taramasalata) all of which were good. Then we had a whole sea-bass with some potato wedges. The sea bass was very well cooked and tasted very good.We had a bottle of the local white wine which was also very good.Having only eaten in a couple of places in Nicosia it is difficult to compare with other places but there is a very good selection of fish and seafood on the menu and what we had was very good indeed.",Pyxida
50,We loved this places . The fish meals are perfect and all other things . We suggest this restarant to anyone .,Pyxida

50,Fine food and excellent service ... classy and elegant place! I chose as a starter savory mushrooms and grilled cuttlefish and white wine sauce. Taste was outstanding .. it is worth the price.,Pyxida
10,"We have been there a lot of times and we were satisfied. However, the last time we visited we were treated badly, no one came to take our order and the waiter was rude so after that we never went there again.Other than that food was good",Pyxida
50,"Fresh fish, good service, pleasant surrounding on the terrace. It was anice surprise to go back to this restaurant, which have change completly.",Pyxida

50,"Although it's on the expensive side, the fish is always very fresh and service is extremely good.If you are visiting at lunch time, you can expect to see a lot of business lunches going on, so it is better to visit at night if possible (it's summer-time veranda and yard are very nice and cool on a summer night).",Pyxida
50,"Fresh fish, well cooked and staff very friendly and helpful! Meze menu is very good but also if you order a la carte you won't regret it!!!!",Pyxida

50,"With 31 deg C in the evening, we sat outdoors in Pyxida and enjoyed a excellent light dinner. Some small Mezzes, all very good, an excellent fresh salad and grilled Octopus and a fresh whole grilled red snapper for mains.The service was excellent and the beer ice cold.The only thing missing was the decor. the place is a bit dated and the food deserves a nicer, redecorated place. Pyxida has another restaurant in Limassol which i visited a year ago. the Same excellent food and service but in a more trendy, beautiful decor and location.",Pyxida
50,A lovely atmosphere in an old traditional home converted to a restaurant. Very professional staff a good selection of fish cooked to perfection followed with great selection f season local fruit and traditional sweets.,Pyxida

50,"The Restaurant is divided into two parts for smokers and none smokers.The service excellent.the choice of fish is rather limited like anywhere in Cyprus but always fresh,prices are moderate to high as fresh fish is rather scarce and expensive in Cyprus.Pixida also has a very nicely situated Restaurant in The New Marina in Linassol",Pyxida
40,"Nice place, nice food, good service but overpriced.. We ate fresh seafood the beer was cold as required during the summer nights the service was average to goid but the bill...well we all said ..overpriced...",Pyxida
50,Excellent. Short comment. Go and try it and you will see. Food and service was perfect. They do everything to make the costumers happy.,Pyxida
50,"Couple night in nicosia, we eat tuna tar tar, mussels, aubergines, olives pate, and one of the best sea bass ever eat. Just perfect. With a good cyprus wine (sauvignon blanc) home dessert (offered) water and coffee... just 52 each... just one of the best quality fish resturant ...at a very good price... absolutely recomended",Pyxida
50,Pyxida is one of my favourite place to visit in Nicosia and Limassol! The fish is always fresh and nice cooked the staff always helpful and friendly!!!! Many thanks to Mr Demetris at Pyxida limassol.. He made our last visit so special with his help!!!,Pyxida
40,"one of the best Sea Food restaurants on the island. no need to travel to the seaside .Very good food ,good service and prices to reflect the level and quality offered.",Pyxida
30,Expected much higher quality and service for the price. Flies buzzing everywhere Food limited . Nothing special Service without a smile,Pyxida
30,"We have been there for dinner.Staff were polite and welcoming but not so attentive. When we were seated they offer us a bottle of water and we thought was complimentary but unfortunately was charged on our bill without asking for it.Two of us went for the fish meze and the rest of us has individual dishes.The food wasn't bad and so the meze. I think the place is too overrated and overpriced considering the service, atmosphere and frozen fishes.I don't understand why is so big fuzz for this place.",Pyxida
50,"There was a big group of us in Pyxida for dinner and we ended up ordering a selection of various fish mezes, which were simply superb. I would advise to check with the restaurant how much food will you actually get becuase we couldn't eat all the food, which was delivered. Red mullet was my favourite",Pyxida
50,"I recommend to visit the place, nice environment, clean , and fresh sea food verity of wine and service is pleasant",Pyxida

The nice staff guided us through the menu and helped us select a delicious dinner. On my top ten list of meals, actually.",Pyxida
50,"Very nice place to go with a nice outdoor terrace. All the dishes were equally tasty, highly recommended.",Pyxida
40,"This place is ideal for business lunches and i choose it whenever i have important meetings in Nicosia. Food is fresh and delicious and the service is ok. The environment is ok but I prefer Pyxida in Limassol which is based in Limassol Marina and the view is excellent. I prefer the fish meze, the portions are big and the variety is good. Price according to food quality and quantity is very good.",Pyxida
50,The variety and quantity of food was more than enough. It’s one of the best choices to treat people for business meetings. But the most important is the freshness of the fish served,Pyxida
50,Food is absolutely great. The best fish restaurant in Cyprus. Excellent service! Everything is perfect!,Pyxida
50,I have been to many fish taverns all over Cyprus. Pyxida Nicosia is by far the best. Fish is always fresh and the portions big. A bit expensive but well deserved for the quality and great service,Pyxida
50,I have been visiting this Restaurant for several years now with some friends and in some other occasions with some business associates always I had received a first class service and the various dishes of fish was very good also.As the Restaurant is very popular I suggest you make a reservation in case you would like to visit to make sure to find a place. As far as prices are considered I should guess it will be on average around 40Eur.per person including wine.Barret Ouzounian,Pyxida

50,High quality fish with good service including starters and sight dishes. Standard quality at all times.,Pyxida

50,"Wide variety of excellent fish dishes (the fish soup is especially tasty), classy decor and very efficient service. Always reliable.",Pyxida
50,"Good fish quality in a place to see and been seen. I do not like the environment so much , could be more relaxed but this is personal taste, the restaurant definitely worth a visit",Pyxida
30,Two persons and we had meze for 2 that cost us 49 euro and 2 small i bottles of wine for one as we only wanted a glass of wine each. Each baby bottle was charged at extortionate rate of 8 Eur each. The meze was not good value. The kalamari which was the tastiest food in meze cane in a small tea plate size so not even enough for one person. Nice other small fish. It as I say not good value.Staff and device was very mediocre so I won't go back in a hurry. Shame as food is nice.,Pyxida
40,The fish mezze was absolutely incredible -all the dishes were excellent and there were so many of them we were completely full to bursting by the end.The mezze even includes fish soup and baklava desserts all for 25 euro -amazing value.We loved the variety.Would have given this place 5 stars but service was like a conveyor belt with the food thrown down on the table often without any explanation of what the dishes were and no-one was particularly friendly.....but still worth going there for the wonderfully tasty dishes!,Pyxida
40,"Very nice place, food is amaizing, service very high and friendly personel.the best choice ...fish meze...",Pyxida

40,One of the best fish restaurants in Nicosia that never disappoints you. Fish meze includes a tasty fish soup and a big variety of dishes. Service is also very good.,Pyxida
40,May be one of the top5 places in Cyprus for fish. Service is excelent and the variety is to everybody's taste. A bit on the expensive side,Pyxida
40,"Its a fishtavern in Nicosia towncentre. Its got a nice atmosphere, good food (possibly the best fishtavern in the capital) but noone should pay this much for fish.. on an island.. on the mediterranean!",Pyxida
50,"If you try to go somewhere else after this fish reataurant, you will be dissapointed . The place has the most experienced ""garçonnes"" in the city. The food is also healthier meaning that it leaves a light feeling compared to the others. The parking system needs a little more attention but overall it is a must go place.",Pyxida
50,"A very good tavern with wide variety of good food. We had the fish meze and enjoyed every bit of it. The service is attentive and professional. Not a cheap restaurant, but not too expensive. The fish meze costs 25 EUR per person.One comment - avoid the house wine (not good at all) and choose something better from the wide wine selection they offer.",Pyxida
50,"We had Fish mezze for two.This is one of the best restaurant i have ever been and the dream of the place make me want to come back to Nicosia soon.Excellent fish dishes, lovely environment and one of the best business lunch i ever had.All in all excellent afternoon.'I WILL BE BACK'",Pyxida

Very nice atmosphere and very pleasant and qualified waiters.you will definitly see us again :)",Pyxida
50,Quality of fish including fish soup and service was excellent. Good choice of quality wines. Owner and waiters/waitress very friendly. Parking available. Make sure you book well in advance.,Pyxida
50,"Quality food,big variety,excellent service but little bit expensive..Usually people who attend this tavern are not ""usuals"".",Pyxida
40,The food was cooked very well .Too much quality in fish meze but the most enjoyable they serve is the fish soup,Pyxida
40,"Excellent fish, old-fashioned attentive sevice, lacking imagination. This being said,, quality is consistent and you can expect no surprises (good/bad). If you liked it the first time, you will like it as much on subsequent visits.",Pyxida
50,"The quality of the food is amazing. Good service, great variety. The only ""down "" is that it's very pricey.....",Pyxida
40,"You can find all sort of fine fish here but you pay a lot for the brand ""Pyxida"", overall too expesnive for what it offers.",Pyxida
50,The only one in his field for the BEST QUALITY FRESH FISH by far . You ALWAYS know for sure that what ever you have order will be up to its high standards.Reason they know there job .For example the oil they use for cooking is of high standard and carefully cook therefore the taste comes perfect.That's the point of difference together with the fresh fish.,Pyxida
50,Excellent fish and service. Great for business although a bit pricey. Location close to the city centre,Pyxida
50,"We had a fabulous dinner with relatives . We enjoyed excellent quality on all food choices served to us,an excellent service by the people who work there. Everybody tried to make this visit as special as it was ment to be. If you are a fish lover don't hesitate to pay a visit to Pyxida .",Pyxida
30,"Lately, Pixida has traded in delicious, perfectly cooked local traditional dishes served courteously and professionally, for a mass market ""sling it out"" ordinary food that can be had in tourist taverns all over the place.Yes, Pixida of old was close to perfect for seafood and fish, but gone from the meze is the grilled octopus, legumes, such as white beans, or fava, traditionally served in Cyprus with seafood dishes, gone are the steamed grilled vegetables, and gone is the attentive individual plated service of the appetisers and of the main grilled fish dish.To serve the maximum people, Pixida now slings out a string of mostly fried meze plates. Fried cod, fried crab, fried calamari, fried shrimp, fried barbouni, and so on. It looks sort of the same because it is almost all battered, and tastes sort of the same. It's like going to a fish tavern in Zigi or McKenzie in Larnaca!And, to make you feel like you are in a tourist place where the plates are served like frisbees thrown on a table, everything is plonked down on huge tables, and all the guests have to fend for themselves. They used to serve every dish to every guest individually on their plate!I was there recently, twice, both times with 9 people or more. All the dishes, including large grilled fish, were placed haphazardly in the middle of these huge round tables. This is not convenient, not comfortable, not welcoming, and certainly not good service.I hope the management does not think that Cypriot customers will not notice, or ignore, all this sneaky cost cutting they have done.The feeling is the customer is taken for granted, like he has no choice.Wake up, fast, Pixida!",Pyxida
50,Love it so much in Limassol so when we went to Nicosia we went straight over there for fish. Didn't disappoint exception great fish. Best fish in Cyprus,Pyxida
40,This restaurant deserves its impressive reviews. The fish is oustanding - so much so that you realise how much you have been missing in terms of quality at other restaurants.And the starters are lovely - even the taramasalata which normally I don't like.The restaraunt is pleasing and the service good. An excellent choice of restaurant. Highly recommended,Pyxida
50,"Whenever we are in Cyprus, we always go to Pyxida for fish. It is always fresh, always perfectly cooked.The place is expensive; but it is worth it.All the food is made with care and excellent quality, and they pride themselves on the freshness of their offer.Accompanying dishes (such as roasted vegetables and appetisers) are also excellent.Desert options are not large but they are good.Definitely a place to keep coming back to.",Pyxida
50,"Having read other reviews, we expected to have a top quality meal and were not disappointed.My wife, on the waiter's advice opted for the fish soup for a starter but immediately had doubts, they vanished with the first taste. She pronounced it was possibly the best soup she had ever tasted. I fancied whitebait but decided to try the sand smelt, a new taste which I found delicious.My wife had sword fish souvlaki which she enjoyed very much. I was going for the fried calamari but hesitated when I saw it was frozen. Our waiter suggested that he choose a piece of fresh calamari (priced by the kilo) of about 300 gm and get that cooked - a perfect solution.We are keen wine buffs and much appreciated the competent advice we received.Food is the most important part of a great meal but service and ambience play a part. The service was outstanding. We never had to struggle to catch a waiter's eye. There was always someone there when we wanted them. The ambience was also good with sufficient space between tables to ensure the conversation of other diners never intruded.We went on Saturday at 7.30 pm in mid January having made a reservation the previous day. The restaurant filled rapidly so I would advise prior reservation to avoid disappointment.",Pyxida
50,"I've been here many time in the past, always on a business trip. The staf are very helpful and professional. The food is excelent.",Pyxida
30,"Was really looking forward to visiting this restaurant. Had been told that, while it was expensive, it was the ""best Fish Restaurant in Nicosia"". Naturally my expectations were high! so here's my review.....Oysters superb, €40 Euro bottle of SanSare also superb., well for €40 Euros it should be! The queen prawns were offered in either red or white sauce, how unimaginative, but let's give the benefit of the doubt it was the English translated menu! And the dish was edible! Plenty of pasta and white sauce, ratio of prawns to pasta questionable. So far so good? Now the highlight?... The service? What service! They were neither welcoming nor efficient. Having finally taken our order, from a menu that is totally confusing, we were sat with absolutely nothing on the table for 35 minutes! When we asked could we at least have some bread, we were barked at ""it's coming"". Whatever we asked for was greeted with looks of distain! Sorry guys this was our first visit to your establishment, your menu is all over the place and your staff are obnoxious!",Pyxida
50,"I think that it serves the best fish meze in town. They start with fish soup, then starters including fresh and crispy vegetable salad and tarama, fried kalamari, squid and octapus, shrimps, sword fish souvlaki, cod, fish croquets, barbouni and fish on the grill with fries. This comes with high quality of service, at reasonable-for fish- prices and in a very nice environment, especially when outside in the yard during spring and summertime. Of course you can order a la carte at the expected fish prices. Highly reccomended.",Pyxida
40,One of the best fish taverns in Nicosia. I reccomend the fish meze.. the fish soup is my favourite! Try it!,Pyxida
50,Amazing food the best fish taverna in Cyprus .the fish is fresh and everything is amazing. Is my favourite fish taverna.,Pyxida

40,"The food was excellent. You can choose from a variety of fresh fish or you can order the fix ""fish meze"" menu, which is of high quality too. The service was very good, from professional waiters.The atmosphere is very friendly and is ideal either for family or for business lunch/dinner.",Pyxida
50,I go there often. For business and family meals. I have never had cause to complain and always get positive comments from clients from abroad.,Pyxida
40,"The tavern is located in the center of town but at romantic and quiet location with nice atmosphere.. The service is good, so is the food. Prices a bit higher than normal. Perhaps the best option for fish in Nicosia . Reservation necessary during weekends and holidays",Pyxida
40,"Always the best service, quality and high standard restaurant. The fish is always fresh and the personnel is friendly and professional.",Pyxida
50,"Pyxida is one of, if not the best fish restaurant in Cyprus, and this is coming from a person that does not particularly like fish. However its hard to resist their fresh food and consistency of taste which are in my opinion, the benchmarks of what a good restaurant should have.Fish is always well cooked, moist and tasty, and their starters and salad crisp and inviting.Service is always polite and the atmosphere relaxed without bothersome music etc.A rare find in Cyprus. Highly recommended that fully justifies the pricing.",Pyxida
40,Meze highly recomended if with a pair of friends or a big group. The list of wine has a great variety,Pyxida
50,"This is one of the best restaurants in Nicosia and I often dine here. It never fails to impress me with great fresh fish, great mussels and a large variety of seafood. I have heard that they have a new oyster bar and I'm looking forward to visiting soon. The staff are wonderful and very helpful. Treat yourselves you'll be delighted.",Pyxida
40,On the high. One of the best restaurants on the island. Best fish soup I ever tasted. Good quick service. Excellent cuisine. On the expensive side. But quality and taste has its price.,Pyxida

40,"Good experience, very good service and excellent fish, personally the blue light was a bit disturbing but generally can recommend!",Pyxida
50,"Nice atmosphere, fresh and well cook fish. I loved the fish soup. The service was excellent. If you want to eat fish it is an excellent choice",Pyxida
30,"I guess the food was good, though not stunning, but there was just waaaaaaaaaay too much of it. That might be fine, if you like that sort of thing, but the two waitresses were nothing short of aggressive - white with fury - when we said we couldn't eat any more. They carried on like that until we left. Go, but don't choose the €24 multi-course option.",Pyxida
40,"This is a fish restaurant in Nicosia center open for many years now. Open for lunch and dinner with a great selection of fish meze. 24 euros per person but about 15-10 dishes offered as a meze Ala carte menu offered as well though.I advise you to book a table for dinner since nights are very croweded. The enviroment is nice (with inner yard during summer months) and very proffesional staff.I think the best restaurant for fish at nicosia city center. Also newly opened an oyster bar as well at the restaurants bar.A good choice for business lunch, romantic dinner or special events.",Pyxida
50,"Tucked in nicely in a quite side street in the city centre, this restaurant offers the best fish platters and meze available in Nicosia. Adored by its local faithful clientele, the restaurant is extremely busy at lunch and dinner time so you'd better make a booking prior to visiting it. The variety of local delicacies, the consistency in preparation and presentation and the experience of the management and staff make it place you want to visit again and again! Great for romantic evenings but also for business meetings and big groups.",Pyxida
50,Amazing restaurant with excellent food and service. Definitely the best fish I have ever had in Cyprus.,Pyxida

40,We always enjoy our visit to this restaurant. Food is fresh and fish is cooked well. Staff are friendly and quslity is constant.,Pyxida
30,"Top fish restaurant in downtown. Very friendly, for business or private occasions. Always fresh fish, good service but very expensive in comparison with similar places in Nicosia. Fish soup as starter is a must.",Pyxida
50,"Maybe even in the whole of Cyprus. Fantastic service. Delicious food whatever you have, but do try the fish maze - but don't eat within 6 hours of getting there as you won't do it justice. Every course was a treat. And the desserts rounded it off perfectly. Good wine list at ridiculously low prices for a quality restaurant. What's not to like?",Pyxida
40,"This place is well known to be one of, if not the best fish tavern in Cyprus. Certainly it lives up to this.A bit on the pricey side, but yes, that's what you have to pay in Cyprus for a good fish tavern.Its traditional fusion with modern. Very good.Excellent for business lunch/dinners.",Pyxida
40,Good location and easy parking (available parking). The seafood is good but mostly fried. The service is excellent. There is a wide variety of nice fish meze although its mostly fried. Possibly a little overpriced.,Pyxida
40,I visited this restaurant a number of times with clients for lunch. The food is good and the fish is always fresh and not over cooked. Free parking is available.,Pyxida
50,"Went twice in the space of a three days visit! This is an excellent high-quality sea food restaurant. You are simply spoiled for choice. The quality of food is superb. All dishes that we sampled, which included squid, octopus, cuttlefish,fish of the day were extremely fresh and very tasty. The casserole cuttlefish and casserole octopus were divine. The restaurant also offers a good collection of local wines at reasonable prices. We particularly liked the Xynosteri (?) local white wine. Staff are very friendly and very accommodating.The restaurant offers sensational views of the marina.Overall a wonderful dining experience.",Pyxida
30,"Excellent service, good location. Overpriced and no octopus in fish meze..What a farse. Most things are fried. Not impressed. May have a name for being a posh fish tavern but there are really better places to go and have fish... even in Nicosia!",Pyxida
50,Best quality fish in Nicosia. The restaurant is very good. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is excellent and with reasonable price but drinks are expensive.,Pyxida
50,"Ordered oysters for boyfriend's birthday, very good quality probably as good as it can get in nicosia. Staff is well trained, woukd reccomend to anyone willing to eat seafood. 5*",Pyxida
50,Very fresh see food!profesional very friendly and helpful staff..wonderful atmosfere..great shrimp..shells..very good Greek and Cyprus wine..I recommend,Pyxida
50,Fish and sea fruits are fresh in this restaurant and you can see and personally choose it. The way they prepared the fish was excellent and we enjoyed in our meals. The choice of wines is also very good. Reservation in this restaurant is necessary!,Pyxida
50,"Every aspect in this restaurant is of high quality: the excellent food ,the friendly and professional service and the cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended!",Pyxida
30,If you go eat at Pixida you know that you will eat good food but you will pay for it! The food is not really different from other fish taverns but the way everything is serves is more fancy and classy. The service is as it should be for the money one pays.,Pyxida
40,"We went there for a quick dinner with business associates, and without reservations. The staff were courteous and found us a table, although the place was packed.The place is charming and the staff are very helpful and friendly; we took some grilled seafood mezze to start and grilled Grouper, all dishes were very tasty and cooked to perfection.They have an interesting wine list with many Cypriot and Greek wines that are interesting and well-priced.From the seafood restaurants in Nicosia, I think this one stands out.A very good choice when craving seafood in Nicosia.",Pyxida
50,"Excellent service, always polite and helpful. Food is super. best fish in town, always fresh . Tavern is located in the centre of Nicosia near shops but in a quiet street. Really nice in the summer as there are many tables to seat outdoors. Been there for lunch and dinner and food was always delicious.",Pyxida
50,Pixida is a great restaurant for fresh fish and various choices of wines to accompany it. Its perfect for business and client lunch.,Pyxida
50,"best fish meze in Cyprus! you wont regret visiting, after 10 years living in Cyprus, I still cant find a better place :)",Pyxida
50,"Superb fish and great service! Consistently perfect - try the tuna carpaccio or the tartare, fried calamari, the daily grilled fish or the various mezes. The selection of desserts is limited: have an extra piece of tuna!!",Pyxida
40,A classic fish restaurant in Nicosia. Good quality fish but expensive. Business people and politicians mostly.,Pyxida
30,I heard that the fish was excellent but I felt it was average. The mezes where average service was excellent. Maybe next time try just meal rather mezes.,Pyxida
30,Good fish tavern but over rated in my opinion. I have been in much better fish taverns. Service did not satisfy me as well.,Pyxida
40,"Fish restaurant which has a great atmosphere and also looks good, clean and professional. Not the cheapest place but the seafood and fish are very good. The service is great, and this is an excellent place for impressing a client or a prospective partner or similar.",Pyxida
30,"I only went to Pyxida fish tavern only once even though fish is my favorite food! The reason is that it is too expensive for what you get. I prefer to drive 40 minutes from Nicosia to Zigi and eat fresh fish by the beach in a reasonable price, rather than go there.",Pyxida
50,"Top service, great food, fresh fish! The only restaurant that can accommodate all needs, from business dinner to family lunch, keeping everyone satisfied with what it is offering.",Pyxida
40,"Friendly staff, good fish, not that cheap. Nice wine selection. Would recommend fried red mallet and grilled calamari.",Pyxida
40,Either you get meze or a la carte both ways you enjoy seafood by all means. The service is always good.,Pyxida
50,"Excellent fish, nice environment, friendly and helpful stuff , prefer not to order meze but specific fish plates. Worth visiting",Pyxida
50,"The Restaurant - Is very well decorated been at the past before and stayed exactly the same. Pleasing atmosphere and very good cleanliness level. i would recommend a refurbishment to make it more attractive and more elegant restaurant.The Food - We went last week and we had mezedes. The food was prepared at perfection, even though it was endless. I would say thats the only negative when you choosing mezedes-Too much food. Excellent food tho.Drinks - fine, nice selection of winesPrice - the price was a bit expensive but when considering the quantity that you get it was ok. However, a more flexible menu will help to optimise your Mezedes menu.I have been and I will go Again. Must go.",Pyxida
30,"We went for friend's birthday. Too expensive, not fresh fish. Poor quantity. We desperately wanted fish soup, that was nice. You have to be dressed formal and make a reservation",Pyxida
50,"Very good service, nice atmosphere, excellent dishes, great variety of fresh fish. Totally worth the price",Pyxida
40,"A very big variety of dishes nicely cooked and served. A continous and steady supply of various fish dishes served in different ways,fully satisfying.",Pyxida
40,The best in Nicosia for fish.Fresh fish and very nice fish meze. Nice place good service.Rather expensive. Cost around €50 per person. Strongly recommend.,Pyxida

50,"It's one of the best fish restaurants in Nicosia, it offers excellent quality fish, try the fish meze highly recommended, it starts with a soup, all sort of fish and it includes desert in the price. It's an expensive restaurant and you must dress accordingly.",Pyxida
40,Pyxida can offer top quality fish and sea-food if you know your fish and know how to order. Everything is always fresh and the service is excellent. A bit on the pricy side but you have to pay for the best. I wouldn't go for the set fish meze though as there are better value-for-money places in town if you are looking for something more standard.,Pyxida
50,"Excellent food, always a huge variery of the vert fresh fish! Top dishes! I would suggest if with a company to get a meze for each!",Pyxida
40,Excellent place for lunch at the Limassol Marina restaurant ! Quality food and quality service. Suitable for mid to upper budgets!,Pyxida
50,"Fresh fish, the best ever fish meze relaxed atmosphere service very good . They always buy the best fresh fish from the fish markets in cyprus",Pyxida
50,Excellent quality fish.We had sea bream with jacket potatoes and vegetables very well served.Pleasant atmosphere and service.,Pyxida
40,"Good atmosphere [,with the exemption of Summer evenings,] with friendly waiters.Option for variety of small fish dishes [meze]. This gives an opportunity for unfamiliar guests, to try different tastes.Rather noisy for those that expect formalities.Good selection of white wines.Price on the high side leaving you with fixed feelings at the end.In Summer time ,in the evenings , tables are outside and it is not very pleasant due to high temperatures.",Pyxida
40,In the center of nicosia.Fresh fishes and excellent variety of sea food! Good service and clean place! Although the prices are a bit high.Its a good choice if you have good friends or colleagues for lunch/dinner.,Pyxida
30,"It cost me 150 Euro for a dinner for two. It is a snobish place but with excellent service and good quality food. However, they charge two much and, in the end, it is not worth it. Go there if you want to impress somebody by spending too much. Otherwise, there are much better places with reasonable prices to dine out in Nicosia.",Pyxida
20,"A friend visiting from aboard insisted on going to this Resturant, now don't get me wrong, my friends always say I am to formally dressed and as my friends visiting were coming from the beach and we live on an island that in summer everyone is in flip flop, short and tank tops, we went to this Resturant and they looked down on us and hesitated to give us a table saying you are wearing shorts!!!I have been to the most amazing exclusive places around the world and this is hardly an amazing exclusive place, staff are fairly polite in a manner they have to be but not wanting to be, food wasn't anything special and it goes without saying it is very overpriced!",Pyxida
30,"This restaurant used to be one of the good ones in Nicosia but not anymore! Fish meze they serve are not of good quality, too much fried and oily. Expensive for such quality.",Pyxida
50,"No one can doubt that the food of this Fish Tavern is very tasty, fresh and well cooked. Prices though are a little bit high but it does worth the money!",Pyxida
30,"They say that this is the best fish restaurant in Nicosia! Been to many fish restaurants elsewhere (Greece many times, France many times also) i can tell that this one is very average to poor... It was one of my favorite places in Nicosia, but this time it was very dissapointing... We had the fish meze with a bottle of wine... Their menu is a bit expensive but that is not a problem if they served good and fresh fish! Starting from the bread they served it was not fresh, but the salad and the strarters were very good. The squid was very very bad, not fresh and not properly cooked and you couldn't chew it! The prawns they served were only 4 small ones, grilled, nothing special... They served some fried ones later but with some fried crabs, cod, fishes etc the fried food got too much... The fries were very good... The crab was full of oil! The red mullets were tiny... And the sea bass was grilled, served with a splash of olive oil and parsley on the top and without olive-lemon extra on the side... Moreover, the service was good, they even treated us with some sweet and ice cream. But with so much fried food, not fresh and nothing special it doesn't worth it... They should serve some fewer things with better quality or with even more fantasy!",Pyxida
50,"This is the J Sheekey equivalent in Nicosia. Slick and professional with great fish. This is not a tavern, it is a restaurant. Tomato salad with cheese is great to start along with octopus and calamari. Fish soup well worth trying.Cyprus waters have been overfished so much of the fish is imported from Egypt and Greece. Pyxida often has Cyprus fish which is great.Expensive by Cyprus standards but this place could be anywhere in Europe. Enjoy!",Pyxida
50,"Whilst on holidays in Cyprus, we took the opportunity to catch up with a client. The food was exquisite and the service just incredible. A place that reflects the great hospitality Cyprus has always been renowned for over the centuries and the simply healthy and tasty Mediterranean cuisine Cyprus is known for to have! A place we look forward to visiting again on our next visit to Cyprus...",Pyxida
50,Great fish! lovely environment!☝🏼️👏🏼 Highly reccomended as it serves fresh fish and really tasty grilled octopus,Pyxida
50,This is the best fish restuarant in Cyprus. It has two branches one in Nicosia and one in the Limassol Marina. Been to both and they are both top quality by any world standard. It specializes in fish and local salads. The selection is amazing and includes local dishes and a variety of finishes from the smallest to large fishes. Delicious! Enjoy!,Pyxida
50,"Undoubtedly the best fish restaurant in Nicosia. Excellent fresh fish, good service. Whatever you choose you cannot go wrong. Excellent fish soup is served during autumn/winter. Try it!",Pyxida
40,"Well cooked fresh fish and nice menu for appetizers, interesting wine list mainly local and greek wines BUT a bit too expensive.",Pyxida
50,"Best fish tavern in nicosia, very fresh fish, very fresh salads , best food quality , very quick service , usually it needs to book a reservation, expensive but it worth the money",Pyxida
50,the food is excellent we tried the fish meze they also offer fish soup which is delicious definitely will go again! a bit expensive restaurant but worths it,Pyxida
50,"If you like fish, do not search elsewhere. Pyxida is your choice. Taste, quality, service, variety. Highly recommended. Reservation essential.",Pyxida
40,"This restaurant has a large variety of seafood on the menu. The quality is generally quite good. It is a popular restaurant, so it is wise to make a reservation the day before. It opens at 7:30 p.m.",Pyxida

40,Nice restaurant close to Nicosia center. The food was nice and adequate but the drawback were the expensive price.,Pyxida
30,"We went to this restaurant by recommendation of many people. First of all we were waiting for 20 minutes for waiter to come and bring us menu. I ordered fish and my husband an octopus. Portions were disappointingly small, served in the huge plates with no side dishes ( not mentioned in the menu that we have to order something to accompany fish or octopus which quite normal in Cypriot restaurants, unless they are fusion tipe ). So, we ordered extra food in order not to stay hungry! Food was average and bill was huge! This is Cypriot family run restaurant and I was not impressed at all!",Pyxida
30,"Mezze was below expectations, very busy on weekends, worth the visit during the week when it is more quite. Good wine selection.",Pyxida
20,"Food is not bad but also not something specialThis place are for those that like recognition from other people in the place, thus this restaurant has regular named people. Very crowded very expensive .You can have a Dior or a visit to this restaurant ; the choice is yours",Pyxida
50,You must try Pyxida and their seafood mezze. Every course was to die for. Great service. Good wine. Very reasonable price for such excellence. Just do it!,Pyxida
40,Very good fish and wine. I was there on a Saturday lunch time and it was very busy. I recommend to do a reservation in advance. Food was very good and the recommendation for the wine excellent.,Pyxida
50,Delicious fresh food and friendly staff. It worths a visit. I absolutely recommend it. Good location. Value for money.,Pyxida

50,"Consistent excellent quality of food and service throughout the years. Great ambience, comfortable, clean and fresh. Suitable for lunch or dinner, business or family, couples or company. Highly recommended. Quite on the expensive side, but as i say you always get what you pay for!",Pyxida

50,I have been suggested this place by local friends ... and they were totally right ... the place to be for fish in Nicosia ! Nice restaurant with a veranda too. Warm atmosphere which puts you in a good mood. Very professional and attentive service by the waiters. Fish meze was great ... everything so fresh and tasty ( except for the prawns which were frozen for sure - no the catch of the day ). Excellent also the choice of the wine : a local Sauvignon Blanc by Melamsopodi. Last but not least very reasonable prices. A place to be back for sure.,Pyxida

40,Great place for entertaining clients. Meze is excellent. Staff are knowledgeable. The place to eat fish in Nicosia.,Pyxida
50,"Best grilled Octopus in Cyprus by far. After renovation became very modern looking place, with great food and atmosphere. The only thing missing (for us as a family) is children's corner. Would be so nice to actually enjoy the great food and keep our little one busy :)) definately recommend!",Pyxida
50,"Excellent restaurant! That says it all! Service is excellent, food always fresh, friendly environment and family friendly too!",Pyxida

50,the best fish restaurant in Nicosia both in the qualityband variety of its food but also the service,Pyxida
50,Excellent quality of food and service. Re decoration improved the ambience significantly. People running the restaurant are always very polite and genuine. Somewhat expensive but the fish is always fresh and cooked very well.,Pyxida
40,"We went here twice , one time we eat mezzè...good!! Second time we eat with menû... Very good the fish and calamari.... You had to work a little bit with pasta guys😉... Spaghetti was orrible!!! Congrats also to the staff , very kindle and fast.",Pyxida
40,"As we arrived we were greeted by a waiter wrestling with two lobsters trying to weigh them. We knew we had got to a fresh fish restaurant. We had the fish meze which was very good value. The menu showed which fish was fresh and which was frozen - very good. Good wine list although the waiter didn't seem to know much about them, we wanted a light red, which we found in the end and was reasonably priced. Altogether we spent €70 for two. It was very busy, so essential to book ahead, we had failed to get a table on the previous evening.",Pyxida
40,"Regular customer. Excellent service, great atmosphere, very good food. Even though the food is always very good, portions' size is occasionally disproportionate. Bottom line, I would recommend this restaurant as I strongly believe is the best fish tavern in Cyprus.",Pyxida
50,"Superb fare. Perfectly cooked. Generous portions. And the delights just kept on coming. Wish I'd done it on a sunny afternoon so I could have taken more time to savour. But that's my problem not something I can blame Nicosia's favourite fish restaurant for. Reasonable price too, all things considered.",Pyxida
50,"If you really want to eat a very good food in a nice place with perfect service , this is the place. We had oysters, calamari, octopus and Red Mullet. Perfectly cooked. And most Important - good value for the money.",Pyxida
50,"Pixida in Nicosia, is, if not the best, one of the best fish restaurant in the island followed by the one in Limasol Marina, food is "" no compromises"", you will always find delicious local fresh dishes next to the most fresh ""catch of the day"" fishes, for excellent buisness lunch or friendly dinners, honestly! Maybe priced for some pockets but when you ask for best you have to be prepared, never disappoint any taste",Pyxida
50,Quality and service is guaranteed. Even if you are in the low budget the meze dish is absolute value for money. I am sure everyone agrees and since this place is well known among the locals I am adding this review for the visitors...,Pyxida
40,"A great location with nice view over the Limassol Marina, friendly and competent service, good choice of fresh fish, should take the fish meze which includes a variety of dishes, easy parking at the close-by Marina car park, good value for money",Pyxida
50,"Very good service with very good quality fish food. We take quests there for dinner, as we are sure of the quality of the food and the atmosphere.",Pyxida
50,Best fish we can find in Nicosia!!! Always fresh and of the best quality! Price wise i cannot say it is super expensive but not cheap either. But whatever the price it is a must visit for fish in nicosia! Service is top too!,Pyxida
10,"Taking a long way from a neighboring town did not get any pleasure. Rude and surly staff, which is unfriendly with guests. Not recommended.",Pyxida
30,"We had very great expectations of the restaurant based on tripadvisor comments, and have to say we were disappointed.The food is not that good, it's just average, and we had many better meals in our last 10 days in Cyprus. Don't get me wrong, it's good, average, but just not as splendid everyone says it is. Perhaps people's eyes get glazed over with the poshness of the place and they don't want to be honest. BTW, despite its name (""Pyxida Tavern""), this is an elegant restaurant (with prices to follow, we paid 120e for modest 4 people dinner), and NOT charming rustic Greek taverna in its typical sense.In short, we will not be back, there's SO many places in Nicosia and Cyprus to have better meal!",Pyxida
40,"Good local food, the taverna itself not in a centre. It doesnt look appealing but the food is rly good. Many local people is visiting",Pyxida
50,Everything excellent! Great meal! There were clear markings of what was fresh and what not. But all food was good. Good for children too. Good service and plenty of parking space.,Pyxida
50,Wide variety of sea food cooked deliciously to one's taste. Highly recommended for evening outings. Enjoy,Pyxida
50,"A must try if you love seafood.The Wild Salmon Carpacio is EXTREMELY good, The Blue Tuna Tartare was also a great choice but we could come back just to have some of those oysters again...a must try...I would also highly recommend the grilled squid, grilled soft shell crab, Fried Scampi and Calamari.The complimentary lemon sorbet is DIVINE !!! You also get a complimentary espresso or tea at the end of the meal.... what else could you ask for...Definitely coming back!",Pyxida
20,"I remember their unique service and fantastic food... It was, some years ago. Now it's just kind of fast food restaurant with poor quality of food, very disappointed.",Pyxida
50,Third visit to Pyxida. Marvellous as ever. Great variety of wonderful fish and seafood. Don't go overboard on the meze starters as there is a lot to come and all of it is lip-smackingly good. Service is attentive but never overdone. Would return here anytime,Pyxida
40,"I was luckily invited for dinner at the Pyxida Fish Tavern - which also means that I cannot comment on the price level but enjoyed:Large private parking that was free of charge - and parking spaces are hard to come by in central Nicosia.A fish soup that was outright awesome;Few salads, also well above average;Magnificent squid/calamares;A local, white fish - did not catch the name, which did not quite keep the excellence seen in everything else;Brilliant sorbet to clean the pallate;I was full, so passed on the dessert, but looked great!Not sure about the sommelier, but my host found wonderful local wines to accompany the excellent meal.Would love to be back, even if just for the soup!",Pyxida
40,Best fish in town is atitle describing Pyxida restaurant as its by far the best in quality and service at the same time. I am not so happy with the wine list of this restaurant as it lucks variety in Cypriot wines which is a pitty as most of as vist the place with business visitors from abroad wanting to taste Cyprus food and wine. The cost is really high not reccomending eating here if you are on a budjet.,Pyxida
50,"I have visited this fish tavern on several occasions, and it never failed to impress me. The quality of the food, the atmosphere, the service and the hospitality are amongst the attributes that are always on the highest level. I have been there on business dinners, family gatherings, romantic dinners, and on every single occasion people that were with me left impressed and more than satisfied.",Pyxida
50,"I and my wife ordered fish meze for 2 person. All of the mezzes,meals and fish were tasty and fresh. All the waiters were smiling and interested every moment. We will meet pyxida again in the future lots of time 😀",Pyxida
50,"Very fresh and tasty fish meze and dishes. NIce friendly atmosphere, excellent service, excellent food. The cooked cuttlefish is the best cuttlefish dish I've had. The grilled stuff is still amazing though.",Pyxida
50,"Pyxida is welcoming its guests in an authentic simple environment, with authentic simple but excellent dishes, due to their fresh and good quality ingredients. Everytime I go there reminds me of a Sunday table at my mother's!",Pyxida
50,"Fortunately, we had booked a table! The place was absolutely packed - no wonder! Their English was maybe not the best, but we could make ourselves understood anyway. We began with sampling most of their starters, I got my Dorada as main course and a nice creme brulee for dessert. The seafood was exemplary fresh, no chewy squid, and cooked to perfection. Well, I did expect the food to be good, but what really surprised me was the high quality of their local wines! (Who has heard of wines from Cyprus!!)The setting was...local. But so was the ambience so its ok.",Pyxida
40,"Atmosphere: relaxed formal (if there is such a style), where a tie is accepted well, but not required. However, the decor and the overall ambiance is definitely not that of a casual place - if you're looking for a place to chill, this is not it. However, it does not feel stuffy or pretentious: quite the contrary, no forced or fake smiles here.Service: the staff know their menu and their kitchen and its capabilities. When you discuss and plan your meal with them, you know exactly what you will receive. Always courteous and efficient.Menu: this is perhaps the restaurant's strongest point. Fresh seafood, fish, crustaceans, mollusks and all you would expect from a top-notch fish place, prepared AND served in the best possible way.",Pyxida
40,"restaurant has good location , good food and good service, however little pricey , you can find similar at lower price",Pyxida
40,"Good! No more, no less! Just good! BUT ALWAYS!You won't find something unusual or amazing at this place.I'd recommend this place for official dinner and formal cases. If you wanna find relax and fun with close friends this place won't be meet your expectations. Sorry, Paragadi! Nothing against you. Your restaurant is a very, very good restaurant, but not more! Unfortunately!",Pyxida
50,I went only one time with my family for lunch and everythink was just perfect.the food was well cooked and the taste was great.the dishes were as fresh as they suppose to be.the service was very good.polite with smile ready to make us feel comfortable and enjoy our lunch.i recoment it for sure.a lovely place for fish in nicosia,Pyxida
20,"Went there after recommendations but I realised that it's overrated and overpriced compared to other similar restaurants.Service is also average for the price of this restaurant. Nothing impressive.They also charge you for things you don't order like bottled water and a €1 donation to a foundation. They should at least ask.Last, we asked for more salad because the one that came with the meze was small and we ran out, and they charged that as well. Considering that we were having the full maze menu plus wine, they could have at least given that on the house.",Pyxida
40,At this place you will sometimes find better seafood than in some of the coastal areas. This place has been around for more than 20 years and for good reason-it is good!,Pyxida
50,"I visited Pyxida for a business lunch during an one-day business trip to Cyprus. Excellent fresh seafood, quick and professional service and relaxed atmosphere. It's highly recommended.",Pyxida
50,we have been to pyxida a month ago and we had fish meze which include various kinds of fish and starters nice service compiened with good management food was very delicious we will go again,Pyxida
50,i recoment that you order the fish meze which is so much that you cannot finish all the dishes.It might be very expensive if you order things like lobster or oysters.,Pyxida
20,"I've been there twice with friends for a dinner. I mean the Nikosia one because the sister restaurant was opened recently in Marina Limassol, and I haven't visited it. The Nicosia Pyxida is very famous between Nikosia people and especially ""high class"" local senior citizens. It's a Greek island style fish tavern, there are a lot of them in Greece, absolutely nothing special on my opinion in any aspects. Maybe for people watching but still boring.",Pyxida
50,Best fresh seafood I had in Nicosia! Great service! Reserve in advance! Great location... Great atmosphere! Highly recommended!,Pyxida
50,"Best fish restaurant I've been in many countries not just Cyprus. Fresh ingredients and quality of service. Not to be missed : octopus starter, swordfish souvlaki. Grumpy points : it's addictive!",Pyxida
50,"Went with some friends on a Tuesday night and was surprised at how busy the restaurant was, the 5 of us had a nice round table with electric fans cooling us all around. A friend had recommended we order a fish meze for 4 persons as the portions are generous and we were glad for the advise as even with one less portion there was still ample food. There was a procession of lovely fish and seafood dishes and really could not fault any of it, the wines were also exceptional (pity i did not make a note of the Cypriot producer) as it was so pleasant. Could not really find fault as the food quality was as good as it gets, at around 35 Euros per head (ok we did have 3 bottles of wine) it was cheap by UK standards but perhaps a tad pricey for Cyprus, but then again this is not your typical fish tavern this is more of a formal dining experience with very attentive staff.",Pyxida
40,"Although I would suggest that if you want to eat fish mezze you should go by the beachfront in Limassol or Paralimni, this is the best place to have fish mezze in the capital of Cyprus. Not so cheap but the amount of food and quality if of the highest standards.",Pyxida
50,"This is a great place to go either for business or with family and friends, Excellent quality on all kinds of fish. Excellent Service !!! Its in a class on its own !!!!",Pyxida
40,Serves the best fish meze in Nicosia. Very good dishes and big quantity. Also very good fish plates if you want something more specific.,Pyxida
10,I have more than one hour waiting for my food. Only excuses. The place was empty when I arrived then is full of people. Everybody is eating but us,Pyxida
50,"wanted to find a good resto in nicosia, even better if a bit out of centre.parking right opposite the resto.book as it's quite busy! nice seating on the outside.got a fish meze for two ppl. you need a good apetite as the portions are big...or rather than big as meze's are you will get a lot of different seafood including a fish. they have some nice greek nd cypriot wines as well.if possible try to get a table which isnt at the main entrance.",Pyxida
40,"This is a great sea food restaurant - its quite formal, in the middle of Nicosia, so relatively dressy. Really good, fresh, sea food and menu, busy and you probably need to book, a great place to enjoy good food for an occasion and very fresh food to suit all ages. Go here if you love fish and dressing up a little!",Pyxida
40,"Excellent fish meze or the choice of one plate. Perfectly cooked , not too oily and very tasty dishes. Personnel was very helpful and polite. Service was good and quick. Lovely outside sitting area with cool fresh air. Free WiFi available. Except the house white wine which was not the best quality , the whole experience was very good.",Pyxida
50,"So maybe I liked the mezzas in another seafood restaurant in Cyprus more than in Pyxida, but the seafood itself is the best I probably had in my entire life. We had fried calamari, grilled octopus, fried red mullets.",Pyxida
50,"It's not easy to find good fish at the towns ,away from the seaside.Exceptionally pyxida makes the difference with fresh fish directly from the sea.Nice service from expert personnel and nice taste.The gyro compass by the entrance is a real one from a ship built 1976.Highly recommended for business lunches",Pyxida
50,Excellent place in Nicosia for fish. Perfectly cooked and presented. Nice and friendly staff. Recommend fish meze with Asprovlaxos.,Pyxida
50,"We ate more than once at Pyxida Fish Tavern on our stay in Nicosia. We were drawn by the positive Tripadvisor reviews and happily agree with them. This is a good place to enjoy well-cooked fish and shellfish in the pleasant atmosphere of the covered garden/courtyard. Wine was a little more expensive than on the menu currently downloadable from their website, but it was still good value. It was interesting to see that Cypriots as well as tourists choose to eat here. I can understand why.",Pyxida
50,"Excellent food and service overall. Fish was really fresh, the mezze were excellent. Overall a great restaurant. Highly recommended.",Pyxida
40,Usually too crowded but with a reason. Very good fish (rare in Nicosia). Many places to seat with different atmosphere. Stuff good and friendly keeping a high standard at the same time.,Pyxida
50,Excellent fresh fish cooked to perfection in the old cypriot traditional meze style. Great and professional service. Good and wellcoming interiors. Prices are considered fair for the fish quality that they offer but they are really pricy for the average middle class wallet!,Pyxida
40,"My wife and I ate at chose this restaurant because it was recommmend by a local taxi driver as a 'special place' to eat, and he was right. It is predominantly sea-food based ( as you would expect from the name). The place is bright and modern and perhaps a tad minimilist, but this is not a derogatory comment - it's just not 'cosy'. The food is first rate, utterly fresh and the staff are proficient. Every thing we ate was of a high standard with no compaints whatsoever. One to consider for a (more expensive) romantic dinner for 2.",Pyxida
40,"A lovely place next to the centre of nicosia with available parking for their costumers. The service was really nice and the food tasty with a various combination of fish. we had 2 fish meze, 2 small bottles of wine ( topical), a bottle of water, fruit and 2 greek coffees and we paid 72 euro's.",Pyxida
50,Had avoided eating seafood in Nicosia as its not on the coast..this has to be one of the best seafood eateries in Cyorus...well worth a visit...,Pyxida
50,"When it is cool enough, it is a pleasure to sit under the pergola outside and watch the who's who of Nicosia conduct business and social meetings at this great eatery. When summer sizzles, move inside for your feast. Everything is fresh and honest, the bread, the impeccably dressed salads, tarama, tapenade, the dainty inkfish tentacles, the whole catch of the day on a platter, the fries and the baskets of lemons that accompany the meal. Service here is professional and discreet, the wine list impressive and the flow of obviously important guests do add to the energy. Do not leave Nicosia without having indulged your inner fish fetish at Pyxida! Reservation definitely recommended.",Pyxida
50,"This place is the best! The restaurant is in an old yellow stone colonial building in central Nicosia. It is split into several different rooms and also has a large external terrace & garden area for dining in the Summer months.The fish is fresh every day and there is a large fridge cabinet in the main entrance with the fish which is sold by the kilo.The service is impeccable with whole fish being 'silver serviced' at your table on linen table cloths, with linen napkins and polished glasses & cutlery. They have an extensive menu including a reasonably priced fish meze which is impossible to finish. The house fish soup in the Winter served with croutons and fresh lemon is wonderful. There is a good choice of salads. Some of the starters can make a meal in itself, deep fried shrimps, grilled or fried calamari, fish kebabs and grilled octupus (the octopus is always soft and tender). The fresh fish comes with perfect chips, vegetables and dessert included. The outside garden is a very pleasant experience in the Summer and is a completely different ambiance from the inside in the Winter months. You are advised to book in advance especially on Friday & Saturday evening and Sunday lunch.",Pyxida
50,"I have been eating at Pixida regularly for many years now. The standard has been consistently top notch. Super fresh food together with the nice set-up of the restaurant and upmost professional service always makes it the perfect evening (as I normally go there for dinner). To be honest, I ate seafood in different places in the world; however I have nowhere felt the same as when I eat in Pixida. In my view, it is the best seafood restaurant in the world in beautiful and historic Nicosia.",Pyxida
30,"it is nice to visit again a must to taste place.my first visit was 3 years ago.this time i choose to taste the ""fish round"" despite the warnings for the total amount of dishes.in general fame is more than reality, but still it was acceptable. Guite big range of sea fruits but they should check their olive oil supplier or they should replace it more often.",Pyxida
50,"I was taken here by work colleagues and they made a very good choice! Great fresh fish, a lively atmosphere and good service. I wasn't paying so I can't comment on value for money but the food was lovely. Overall a very good meal.",Pyxida
50,By far the best fish taverna in Nicosia with outstanding consistency. Fish is always fantastic and the variety of meze is beyond your imagination. Great service and in summer time the outside garden is lovely. Great for business meals or with friends. In the middle of the town with the best parking availability than any other place. Not to mention the good wine cava.,Pyxida
50,"Excellent food and professional service. This place never dissapoints. Whether you order a meze, kalamari, octopus or prawns, everything is fresh, including the salad. They also have a very good selection of wines. It may be a bit more expensive than other fish restaurants, but it's well worth it.Highly recommended.",Pyxida
50,The place delivers consistent quality. Flexible with your request and they do their best to accommodate your specific request. Great place for a business lunch/dinner as the waiters are quite well trained.,Pyxida
20,Extremely expensive; service is good; food good quality however not something special; the restaurant is overcrowded with limited space; it is a restaurant for show off not for relaxing and gastronomy; thus it is consider no value for money,Pyxida
50,Nice cooked fish meze with high quality service in an air conditioned environment.Definitely value for money! Would visit again and again.,Pyxida
40,Had business lunch in Pyxida in late June 2015 and we were really pleased both with the excellent food and the service. The waiters were very professional and even knew how to prepare food for some of our guests who were strict adherents of the Jewish faith. Our guests were very impressed. The price was very reasonable. Only downside that at lunchtime during the week it gets very busy (it's the prefereed restaurant for business lunches) and the setting is nothing special.,Pyxida
40,It was a nice place to have lunch. Nice quality of food but a bit expensive. They did not offer something that cannot be found in other fish restaurants.,Pyxida
40,"This reataurant has been a staple for the business lunch crowd for years, and maintains its quality of food and service. Regulars are well catered for, with friendly service and preferences acknowledged by staff and management. Fish is the centre of attention, but the quality is present through-out, for salads, starters fruit and deserts. Good selection of wine as well.",Pyxida
30,"This particular restaurant has had mixed reviews, we called in for lunch, as over fin Nicosia or the weekend, but walked away very disappointed.Service rather slow, food not well presented, if you took the batter away from the Meze, it was spot the fish content! although mentioned to staff I was informed it was normal, hence we will not return, recommend.",Pyxida
50,"Excellent service good polite atmosphere, really fresh fish and the soup was fantastic! Expensive but worth what you pay",Pyxida
50,"Our experience at Pyxida Fish Tavern was outstanding. Some reviewers have commented that they found the place a bit pricey, but seafood is expensive, even in Greece, so I didn't think that Cyprus would be any different. Our service was exceptional and the fish for two that we ordered was more than we could finish!",Pyxida
20,"We were so disappointed with this restaurant. We had high expectations given its rating and chose it for lunch on our day out in Nicosia. The restaurant was empty, ok so it was not long after 12:00 but we thought it would be busy for lunch. The staff were less than communicative. We were poured some bottled water without being asked, which turned out to be charged for. We started to get suspicious when we spotted on the menu that the prawns were frozen, not fresh. It got worse when there was no whitebait available despite being on the menu. The bread wasn't anything special, nor the fish soup or the fried ""cod fish finger"". We left after those starters and there was no ""apology"" for recognition of our disappointment. We cannot recommend this restaurant on the basis of this wasted visit. Hope it turns out better for others.Steve",Pyxida
40,Nice food Service needs improvement but is ok for a tavern Needs little more persobal touch nice variety of fish and impressive taste and presentation,Pyxida
50,"The quality of the food and service is beyond reproach. Fish, octopus, salads are to die for. The tuna tartare is an absolute must. The decoration could be updated a little but with food this good, who cares.",Pyxida
40,"If you love seafood, that's the place for you in Nicosia!!! It's a bit pricey but for the quality of the food and the service it's totally worth it! Child-friendly, quiet environment and particularly nice music. P.S. You have to try the spaghetti with shrimps!",Pyxida
50,"I've been at Pyxida multiple times and it's always great! We actually went to Puxida when we got engaged and we really enjoyed our time there. Delicious fish, pleasant staff and excellent service!",Pyxida
40,"A bit pricey but good quality, very good food.Staff service was nothing exceptional for the price, just everyday politeness. We were there just for some wine but got nagged by the waiter if we wanted food, which turned out to be good for us because the food was delicious!",Pyxida
40,"Would not normally pick a fish restaurant so was apprehensive when our host invited us for lunch here, I was pleasantly surprised, all of the dishes were great in a traditional atmosphere, look forward to my next visit",Pyxida
30,"I've been in Pyxida few times and the mostly for Business Lunch with quests. We are every time happy with the service and the food is actually quite fine, though the price s do not justify the means.",Pyxida
40,"Good service, nice food. Outside garden is very nice but the inside needs some redecoration. It is a family as well as a business environment. Especially enjoy their soup during the winter.",Pyxida
50,"How add more details to a amazing place with a smiling staff, good wines and great food?Everything was great and the respect of thpical cousine offers a new experience to the visitors: I am bored to find the same things all around the world. Food is also a great cultural expression and in this case all of the surrounding elements were really great...It is not my first time and not the last for sure.A single issue: stop smoking at table. It is a lack of respect to other clients and harms the non smokers",Pyxida
50,Honestly I can name only two restaurants in Nicosia where I eat seafood. One of them is Pyxida. I often visit this restaurant mostly lunchtime. After any meetings this is a safe place to take even the most difficult business partner for a nice lunch. The seafood is fresh and prepared well. The fish is never dry which is a very common mistake in Cyprus. The service is also professional.Concerning the price I should admit that it is very expensive.,Pyxida
40,The fish is excellent and the service of very high standard. The fish was fresh and perfectly coocked and also the salads and grilled vegetables.,Pyxida
50,"The food is fresh, the service is excellent and prices value for money. I suggest you have selected fish with a few starters and of course their fresh salad and tarama",Pyxida
40,"Mouthwatering soup and fresh fish served here. You can pick and choose the types of fresh seafood you want, gr8 service, very attentive staff. Atmosphere is a little 'businessy' and have not seen any kids there on a few visits now. Very expensive.",Pyxida
50,"A colleague and I tried this restaurant based upon TripAdvisor reviews. We did not have a reservation, but were seated immediately. Menu items had a wide range of prices, but we decided on the fish meze for 23 euro each. The staff also recommended a great wine to suit the meze. The dishes of the meze were outstanding and numerous. Overall, we were pleased with our experience and would return in the future.",Pyxida
50,"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, excellent fresh fish and salads. Many selections of wines!!!! I'll visit it again!!!",Pyxida
30,"As this is one of the most famous fish restaurants on the island, my standards were already set to ""high expectations"" mode before I even arrived there. In short, meeeeeh... The first standard entrée or ""meze"" dishes were definitely of a very poor quality, particularly taking into consideration the reputation of the place. The fish roe dip (aka taramosalata in Greek), for example, was absolutely unacceptable. It was that fake, pinky, sticky stuff that I would be ashamed to serve if I was the owner of the cheapest fish tavern. On the other hand, the main course (we had a large sea bass on charcoal) was excellent. Fresh, tasty and properly prepared, juicy and nicely seasoned. Hence, my ""very good"" rating on the food. The service was decent. I have absolutely no complains about it, but I did not leave thinking that I was offered anything special or extraordinary. The environment was, again, alright, but nothing spectacular. Overall, with all of these plain average characteristics of the place, you leave thinking that you paid for something golden, but you only received something silver. Silver is good, but it is not gold.",Pyxida
40,"I have seen some reviews complaining about price levels been high at this tavern. However, I would argue that this is not true. In fact, Pyxida should be seen as a tavern having two faces: one which offers 'a la carte' dishes and high quality (high price) fish (like synagrida), and a second which consists of a reasonable fish-meze at a moderate price. In both cases you can add excellent Cypriot wine at unbeatable good prices. I have tried both, the 'a la carte' as well as the 'meze'. If you know about good fish, I would suggest you rather go for the 'a la carte': order a good salad, a few starters (with or without soup / which is excellent), and select a fantastic fish from those available on that day, add a bottle of white wine and there you are! You will enjoy an unforgettable meal!",Pyxida
20,"Food is quite good. However, the staff is not friendly at all... sometimes even intimidating. It can definitely be a reason for not coming back.",Pyxida
50,"Dont go for the mezze, order a la carte and if you are price concioua its not your place. They are the only onea offering blue fin sashimi and grilled. Sardines are just like in Greece and the fries are cut in house not frozen. You dont het that elsewhere anymore. Book to avoid dissapointment.",Pyxida
30,"This fish restaurant is so expensive that it is ludicrous. The quality of the food and the service is very good indeed, but definitelly not worth the money. There are so many better fish taverns in Nicosia and in Cyprus in general that should make one think twice before visiting Pyxida.",Pyxida
50,High quality fish - excellent service by Cypriot or any standards - confident saying this is Cyprus' best higher quality fish restaurant,Pyxida
50,"If it's good fish you're looking for then this is the place to go. The green olives marinated in lemon and coriander seeds are truly possibly the best on the island. The very generous seafood salad is excellent (though slightly too oily) and the octopus perfectly made. There is a choice of farmed or wild (at extra charge) fish as well as the usual fried chorus of meze plates.On a week day this is a business restaurant. Don't go if you want to relax and chill out, it's full of young and old suits filling up and talking shop-though no-one minds kids and everyone is friendly.The 'outdoor' smoking area is fully enclosed with plastic sheeting so everyone is inhaling various concentrations of smoke.....",Pyxida
20,"Overrated, overpriced, crowded. I have been there 3-4 times in the last six years. Last time there, last October, I found a hair in my food and the staff was trying to convince me it was mussel beard.",Pyxida
50,Friendly staff! High quality service. Delicious food and an amazing fish soup for starter. Highly recommended.,Pyxida
50,"As I am not a huge fish tavern enthusiast but having the experience of trying a number of fish restaurants in Cyprus, I have to say that this is the best fish tavern in the island, by far. In all honesty, it is one of the best restaurants in Cyprus in my opinion. My family and I are loyal customers since day one of operations and the quality has not changed one bit. Excellent food, good atmosphere, great wine selection.I would suggest the vlachos fish wrapped in salt (check the price before you order) and the octopus. They never fail...",Pyxida
50,This restaurant is nice but have in mind - it is not just fish taverna - it us VERY IMPORTANT fish taverna ;) this place is traditionally is meeting place for big business and those who are ready to help with keeping business in Cyprus.Means: the food is perfect but mind your dress code! :)Enjoy :),Pyxida
50,Best fish tavern in Nicosia with great food. Good service and quality. Worth visit it and while ur there don't forget to try the fish soup it's excellent.,Pyxida
40,Great food and service. Value for money and friendly staff. Fresh ingredients. Try the fish meze accompanied with a nice Greek wine.,Pyxida
50,"I have been dining at this Fish Restaurant for more than 5 years, because is at the very top of this type of Restaurants offering ALWAYS Fresh fish, like Red Snapper, Red Mallet, Kalamari etc.The staff is very polite and eager to give you the best service. A good selection of local and imported wines is also available. Prices are a little bit on the high end, but it is worth it for the quality and service.Very good for business lunch, as well as evening dinning with friends.",Pyxida
50,"Certainly the best fish restaurant in Nicosia, you can have a traditional fish meze or individual dishes, mostly traditional but with some contemporary/foreign options. A bit on the classy and expensive side, but certainly a great restaurant with a good list of wines.",Pyxida
50,This was by far the best meal we had in Nicosia. Pyxida is a meze style seafood restaurant. The quality of the food was excellent and the food just kept coming. The seafood soup which was our first course was excellent and they served one of the best calamari dishes I have ever had. I'm not sure what the cost was but everything else was excellent.,Pyxida
40,"Fish restaurants tend to be expensive and a lot of them don't justify the price because the service is bad or something else makes it a bad choice.This is a place that not only has service, but quality as well. The owners have ensured that although you are paying a premium, you are getting a premium service as well.I have been a few times and everything has been fresh, well cooked, presented well and hot where need be - you will be surprised how many times fish can come to your table cold as it cools down quickly.The fish meze is a good introduction to the restaurant and very reasonably priced.A special night out, good service, food and atmosphere.",Pyxida
50,"This was a business trip and hence taken here twice by two separate parties, both of whom consider it the best in Nicosia. Had to agree. Food was excellent, nicely served. Wine was Greek rather than Cypriot, but this along with menus were ordered by the hosts. Can be a bit noisy, however, if you plan to talk business. The restaurant is easy to find. Everybody knows it. My colleague adored the octopus.",Pyxida
40,"Pyxida is a good seafood option in Nicosia. Liked the large choice of appetizers - ordered the tarama and the haloumi I cheese that were excellent. I then ordered the grilled octopus which was excellent - nice flavor of olive oil, lemon and oregano. My wife chose the shrimp saganaki which was only ok. Was a bit surprised that the octopus and the shrimp were frozen and was hoping they would be prepared fresh. Pyxida however has a large choice of fresh fish you can choose from.",Pyxida
40,Assuming you like fish meze this is the place to go in nicosia at lunchtime. They have never dropped their quality. They also have a great fresh fish selection for those who do not mind large fish and are not mercury sensitive. The only downside is the fresh fish price per kg which is quite high for place with no sea view. Dont miss the fish soup its the house specialty many come for over the years.,Pyxida
50,The best by far fish tarven we have in Nicosia. They have kept high quality of their food for many years. Their meze contains a wide variety of dishes including soup and desert at the end. It costs about 23 euros per person but it is totally worth it. It is highly recomended!,Pyxida
50,"i have been many times in pyxida fish tavern, all the times the same excellent food,nice costumer service,wonderful atmosphere",Pyxida
40,"The food is fine, indeed. Nothing extraordinary. As most people claim. Have visited many times, last visit was early September, 6 of us, and apart from the grilled octopus which I ordered as main dish, I highly recommend as main dish for octopus lovers, and the vegetables, most other dishes are fine. Sure the fish is fresh and tasty, like it should be in the first place. The staff are very attentive, and well trained, and this does make a difference. Overall, a very professional establishment. Hence, it's busy all year through!",Pyxida
40,"We showed up at the restaurant without reservation and got a table for two really loucky - it is a very popular place in Nicosia, and after having two fish dishes we know why. I tried their seafood salad and it was really delicius. But make a reservation a day in advance if you wanna be sure on having a good table outside the smoking-salon.",Pyxida
50,"Our dinner last night confirmed that Pyxida Fish Tavern respects its standards, its very high standards, from year to year. The menu is extensive and whatever we ordered was superb. Excellent first salads, wonderful small fried shrimp, tasty cooked soupia, and as for the main courses, both grilled Octapus and the Xifias souvlaki were outstanding. Maybe this -my fourth, I think, over the last few years- visit to this successful restaurant was very happy because of the company of one of my best friends! Having said all that, the service could have been better: less ""seriousness"" and more smiling faces are recommended...",Pyxida
50,"If you love seafood, work up a big appetite and go with a companion to Pyxida Fish Tavern and order the seafood mezes on the back page of the menu. Incredible feast. Starts with a delicious fish soup; then traditional mezes such as olives, tahini, taramasalata, etc., accompanied by green salad with wonderful Cypriot tomatoes and cucumbers. Then comes an amazing array of seafood mezes, including cod croquettes, grilled baby octopus, fried calamari, jumbo shrimp, sea bream, cod fritters, tiny fried baby crabs, Etc. Just when you think you can't eat another bite, dessert comes: baklava, halwa and mastika ice cream. You will eat it all, because it's all delicious. Service s outstanding as well. Don't miss this great restaurant.",Pyxida
50,We ordered the fish meze. Everything was so delicious and fresh! Always order one meze less than the number of people in your group because the food is too much. Worths every penny!,Pyxida
50,"A place where you would always find fresh fish.A bit expensive,especially the wines that are way overpriced!The yard at night is fantastic!Recommended for sure!",Pyxida
50,"If you are not worried about the cost and you wish to eat good quality fresh fish, then this is the place to be. The service is excellent and up to the standards one would expect for the price paid. Due to its location (Nicosia centre) and the quality of its food, this fish tavern is used by business people a lot. Enjoy!",Pyxida
50,This restaurant is possibly the best in Cyprus. It exudes class without being extortionately priced. Come here for the local sea food allof which is exquisitely prepared washed down by great selection of local wines. Grilled octopus. squid and local snapper are all few a choices. I have been here half a dozen times and it never fails to not the right spot!,Pyxida
50,"A long established fish tavern in Nicosia. Great food, be sure to try out the fish soup, which comes as s starter if you order fish meze. In my opinion a few new plates need to be added to the fish meze, however everything else is perfect!",Pyxida
40,"One of the best fish taverns in Cyprus. The fish is great and fresh, the setting is perfect and the waiters very helpful and polite. The fish soup was an excellent choice! The only downside is the price. We paid 220 euro for six persons having the basics. Again one of the best if not the best sea food in Cyprus but also one of the most expensive.",Pyxida
50,"Fresh fish, good price and unique atmosphere! The service is very friendly and high standard. You have to try it!",Pyxida
50,Nice building Nice surroundings Superbly presented Fish and Shellfish Meze The Fish Soup is the best I've ever tasted Not cheap but for the quality of food its exceptional value Booking is essential at the weekend,Pyxida
40,This is the place for fresh fish well cooked.The atmosphere is good with excellent service.Good value for money.,Pyxida
40,The best fish tavern in Nicosia !!! Excellent fish soup. Ask for fresh fish; well cooked and very tasty!!,Pyxida
50,"Really good fish meze at a rather affordable price. The atmosphere of the restaurant is somewhat ""posh"" in comparison with other local taverns.",Pyxida
40,This is one of the best fish places in town. The service is always good and the fish is fresh and done right. Bit on on the pricy side but the quality and service is probably worth it. The atmosphere is not the best and the noise level can be quite high as it typically caters to large groups which tend to be louder than couples or families. A place worth trying out!,Pyxida
40,I have been to this place for dinner a number of times with professional guests. It is a nice and homey place to take non-Cypriots. The food is good as well as the service. I think it is a bit pricey. Also it can get crowded.,Pyxida
50,"Strongly recommend.This is the best fish place in town, full-stop.the interior is a bit formal and lacks intimacy, but provides for an excellent highend Service and lots of Folks running around with Food and fish etc.good parking opposite, too.Very warm welcome, we came late, at 2.30 and strill were offered full menu",Pyxida
50,"I have been there many times. This reason is that it is probably the best fish restaurant in the whole island. It offers every time great selection of fresh local fish, the best you can find.Great atmosphere especially during summer time outside. You should try it.",Pyxida
40,"Good variety of fresh seafood, nice waiters even, even with the restaurant full they got a place for me and the service was quite quick.",Pyxida
40,"Yes , very good food,fresh fish , nice people and...........very good price. I always come here when i am in Nicosia . Pyramids",Pyxida
50,I was invited by a friend to have lunch there and though i wanted to eat something light i couldn't refuse the offer. This place is by far the best to have fish in Nicosia. It may not have the sea next to it but the quality of food is probably the best i had in a long time. Service and atmosphere also very very good. The same restaurant is located in Limassol Marina that i also visited few months ago but it was Sunday night and there was not a lot of fish left after a very busy day.The scenery there of course is much better than Nicosia. Highly recommended for those who want the best food available.,Pyxida
40,"It is the best fish tavern in Nicosia. It is better if you select what fish you want to eat instead of eating the meze. The a la carte dishes are superb. We tried shrimps, octopus, small fried fish and several more since we are regular customers and everything was excellent.It is one of the most expensive ones, that is why I suggest you spend your money on food not on side dishes and hors d'oeuvres. The fish soup is also a signature dish that we always have before our main course.",Pyxida
50,"Situated in Nicosia city centre, this fish tavern is the perfect place whether you are treating guests (business) or friends / family. Food is excellent, always fresh and one has the option of 'meze' or individual dishes accompanied by side dishes. I would strongly recommend (if a group of people) to avoid the 'meze' and choose various dishes to share, leaving grilled fish for last!!! Best impressions!!!",Pyxida
50,"We have just had dinner today. We were three and we ordered the degustation menu. We made one only mistake that was ordering one menu for each person. That turned into a huge quantity of food that we could not take. The fish and seafood was really good. I am Spanish, we are used to such type of food and I have to say that the quality was really good. The price was really OK, including a bottle of wine, lowest price, that was really fine. Next time, we will order 2 menus for three persons. Disregarding this, perfect: place, attention, service level.",Pyxida
50,"The food is of best quality but if you are ordering meze for sharing the food is too much, the last time i went there the last plates have remained untouched as we were all full.",Pyxida
50,"great fish quality, rather expensive but it deserves it. fresh fish. good location in limassol. highly recommended",Pyxida
50,"Living in Larnaca ( seaside town ) we dont often travel to a town with no sea to eat fresh fish . BUT then we came across Pyxida and i must say i left a very very happy customer. The gentleman ( waiter ) that approached was very professional and guided us on what to have so we dont order too much. The octopus was perfectly cooked and not too chewy. The seabass was delicious and the excellent team cut it for you to avoid you messing up the fishTo top it up they finished us up with some lovely kateifi and mastixa ice-cream, one of the few places in Cyprus that i actually wanted to leave tips because they actually deserved it.",Pyxida
50,"Expensive but worth its money. Service was professional, the wine list was up to date and covered all possible choices. The food was amazing!",Pyxida
50,"What ever I order in Pyxida Fish Tavern the fish soup is always included in my choices! I'm a huge soup lover and I had fish soups in different places all over the world! Their fish soup doesn't taste like any other I tasted, It doesn't taste like Greek fish soup, or Italian or French! They have their own unique recipe which has proven to be very successful through the years. However the soup is just one of their highlights! I would also recommend the grilled dentex or any other of their grilled fish dishes!They serve it with grilled vegetables and perfectly cooked, sliced cut fried potatoes. The fish there is fresh and they only use fresh ingredients in general! When it comes to fish Pyxida is the place to eat!",Pyxida
40,The best fresh fish i had and very nice garden where you can enjoy your dinner!!! good service also and smiling faces !!!,Pyxida
40,"Very nice food, big variety, friendly staff and good service. I will definitely visit the place again. Recommended.",Pyxida
50,"With a meze for just €23 per head, this was the best meal that we had in Nicosia. For those who have never experienced a Cypriot meze, this is what you have coming.. 3 dips, nice bread, grilled calamari, fried calamari, fried shrimp, chips, (1 whole) grilled fish, octupus stew, fried crabs, muscles, fried trill... and these are some of the plates I could recall. Not to be missed but go with an empty stomach",Pyxida
40,"One of the finest fish taverns in Limassol, located in Limassol Marina. The fish is fresh and well cooked, quantity and quality is perfect. It provides a variety of starters and other fish dishes.The staff is friendly and the service is good although there was a misunderstanding as to who was the responsible waiter for our table. Initially, we have been asked by 3 different people if we are ready to order without offering their menu. I understand this is excused since it started operations only recently. Wine list is fine with a variety of local and imported wines.Recommended for business dinners as well.",Pyxida
10,"Food was far from worthing the price. We went there at 7 poeple and tried many different dishes. We were desappointed by all of them.Starters and main courses were exactly the same dishes (oily, simple preparation...) but price were doubled. They explained us that there was supossed to be more quantity for the main course, which is almost invisible in the dish but clearly noticable on the invoice. Anyway, it would have been appreciated to be informed by the waiter that starter and main courses were the same (which was not the case).Some fishes were dry and not well prepared.Starters and courses in general are served in a very simple way, without any effort to make nice, beautiful and attractive dishes.Service is also awfull. As an example, they put on your table 2 forks and 2 knives. After starters, none of them were removed and plates were not changed as well. I had to remove myself the rubbish from it to continue the dinner.Service was also very long despite the restaurant was not very busy for a friday evening, compare to the others around.Finally, the invoice was over charged by 12 euros of mineral water, which was gently served when we arrived and sit, but for which we never asked. They finally removed it after we noticed this to them.I really don't recommend the restaurant, and the 6 other poeple i was with, don't recommend it as well.",Pyxida
50,I come often to Pyxida specially with customers. Tonight I came with my wife. Even the restaurant was full the service was excellent and the fish just delicious. If you ever visit Nicosia it is must place to visit. Every dish is so fresh and tasteful.,Pyxida
50,"If you are a fish lover this is a place to be, quantity and quality of food served is what makes it perfect. The staff is friendly as well as the service is excellent. No need to say more, undoubtedly one of the best fish taverns in Cyprus",Pyxida
40,"Is a very good fish tavern with good food and very good cooking, clear enough. The only think I dont like is the place. I cannot eat fish in a fish tavernwhich is not near the seaside.This is the reasoning j7jhh",Pyxida
40,"Elegant atmosphere with very good service and tasty food. The fish meze is good with a variety of different fish plates,nevertheless it does not offer the quality of the past. It also offers the best fish soup o have ever tasted.",Pyxida
50,Nicosia lacks sea but with Pixida it has one of the finest seafood restaurants in Cyprus. Service is very efficient and friendly with the owners personally involved.Great variety of starters and fresh fish and prices are certainly lower than some other well known places. Soft crab is a great delicacy. Solid wine list and good deserts. Generally very busy but the service is always of very high level.,Pyxida
50,Maybe the BEST fish restaurant in cyprus i go for a birthday party everyone's order fish meze!!!Everyone eat very good and we bring home 4 big plates extra fish because is a lot the price for all this it was very good for fresh fish in nicosia,Pyxida
50,Great food!!! Good service with a touch of city style!!! Good people in a good environment. Parking available in the city which is a must for any restaurant.,Pyxida
50,Excellent fish in the CYPRUS capital and vey good service. Went twice this month as we had a business guest from USA. We loved it there.,Pyxida
40,The fish here is amazing one if the best in nicosia very good quality me and the wife were left amazed by the freshness would definately recommend for all fish lovers,Pyxida
50,Ate here with colleagues today and really enjoyed it. We did the mezze and had more food than we could eat. Every course was excellent! I would definitely return but would try to pace myself a little better next time!,Pyxida
50,"A very good fish restaurant, must be the best in Nicosia, but expensive. they showed us all the fish on offer, so we could choose, Great food",Pyxida
30,"I will start by saying the fish is excellent.The actual restaurant we found intimidating. As we arrived, there were 5/6 waiters, all looking at us! They needed something to do! Who on earth is the big,grumpy,sour faced, miserable lady serving? She certainly wasn't welcoming.You only have to take a sip of wine or water, and one of them will come to top up your glass!!As we left, all 5 waiters were standing at the door, looking, again!!Expensive, yes, fish was worth it, but attentiveness was too much.Wouldn't return",Pyxida
40,"As said above it is probably the best fish reataurant we have in Nicosia, the food is excellent, the service top rated, good environment but it is expensive.",Pyxida
40,"If you are looking for sea food, and fresh ingredients, this is the place. Good service and friendly staff. Quality is always and variety of food are excellent",Pyxida
50,"Four person had dinner Excellent service Quality of food was super My guests enjoyed it a lot! Wine was at right temperature , and the atmosphere was very pleasant",Pyxida
40,"Now this is part of the Mediterranean way of eating; if one orders the mezze, the table gets flooded with every small plate and different tastes that one should sample and enjoy, unfortunately, the risk is that by the time you reach the grand finale: ""The Fish"" which is usually of very good quality....your stomach is completely full and you miss the best part of the meal. I recommend you just limit the choice to start with and go for the fish!",Pyxida
50,"great fish variety, they know the proper way to cook the fish and the service always comes with a smile",Pyxida
50,"We went to this restaurant on a Saturday noon for lunch. Two couples and a baby.At first I want to say that service is great. Even though the place was half full there were lots of waiters ready to serve.We did not order the meze dishes in order to avoid any fried seafood.We ordered the soup for starter, some fresh grilled kalamari and octopus with a salad to share and a big sea bass to share for the main dish. We had desert for each one of us and some ouzo.First of all: DON'T MISS THE SOUP! Such an interesting taste, so fresh and so tasty.Kalamari and octopus were also great and fresh.The fish we got for the main dish was cooked to perfection and was served to us in our own plates with grilled vegetables on the side.Deserts were also tasty but nothing special.As far as the price is concerned I believe that it is a but expensive but I can find many reasons for that.It's not a place to go 2-3 times a week for lunch or dinner. It definitely is a good eating experience and worth a visit.I personally find the food, the environment, service and prices much better than many places in Limassol and Larnaka.",Pyxida
50,"Amazing food, friendly stuff, simply the absolute best for Nicosia. In a city with no sea it is rare to find such a nice fish restaurant.",Pyxida
50,"Although a seafood restaurant offering a large selection of fresh fish, non fish eaters can enjoy a very enjoyable meal as well - you just need to order it in advance. Service is good and friendly and the portions are very big. Well worth a visit if you do not want to drive to the coast.",Pyxida
50,"Was invited for a business lunch and returned for private dinner the following night. Ordered the fish meze that came with a fish soup. If you like fish soup, then you must try. I even thought of having a second portion and not having a main. The meze includes everything you can imagine. Dips, salad, small and big fish, red mullet, octopus, squid, prawns, chips... I was full half way through. Great desert as well and good selection of wines. I recommend this place to anyone who likes fish, without any reservation.",Pyxida
30,"Overly crowded and overly priced. Better quality fish restaurants can be found close to it where you get a better service. The only thing this place keeps on doing well is the fish soup, all the rest has lost its quality and standard over the years.",Pyxida
50,"excellent fish fresh every day, helpful staff, nice and warm atmosphere. the price is a little expensive...",Pyxida
30,I used to visit Pyxida quite a lot. It had great service and tasty food. But the last time we went there it was below their standards. Almost average. The service was not as we were used to and the food was kind of undercooked..I don't know if it was a coinsidence because we didn't visit again after this time.,Pyxida
50,An excellent Fish Tavern despite the fact that it not situated near the Sea. In Cyprus being an island people expect to enjoy Fish Meals near the sea. This is not the case. The very easy parking is an advantage particularly in Nicosia.,Pyxida
40,"Excellent quality of fish dishes and a big variety ( we orderd fish meze).We found prices high and the environment not so nice.Clientele mainly local people of some age. The staff not friendly, strictly proffessional but service very good.",Pyxida
50,"Always serving fresh fish, staff was excellent, great fish meze! We always prefer this tavern for fish in Nicosia",Pyxida
40,a great fish place in Nicosia. as good as fish can ever get in a restaurant away from the sea! service is excellent. prices are high,Pyxida
50,"Upon visiting 'Pixida' I could receive the feeling of being in an atmosphere where rich people, business people and families had their lunch or dinner. I couldn't value the food according to the bill though. It was a rather expensive visit to a fish restaurant that personally I won't be able to forget. The location was not very good and also the place as such was very close packed... I don't recommend this restaurant for tourists in Nicosia who are not willing to pay more than 30 euros per person.",Pyxida
50,For locals it's probably the best fish tavern in Nicosia and maybe one of the best in the island even it's located in the mainland.Please order fish meze (about 21 to 23 euros per person - taxes included) and you will be amazed by the quantity and the quality of the dishes and also from the service.You can also order fish by kilo but that will raise the final bill....Order a good white wine from Cyprus and....cheers!,Pyxida
40,Ideal for entertaining guests . A good selection of quality sea food n wines. Highly recommended for business lunch or dinner.,Pyxida
40,You have good quality food and the fish is fresh. At lunch time you will see some politicians there enjoying the food in a relaxed atmosphere. I recommend the fish soup.,Pyxida
50,"Beautiful local fish restaurant with great value. Good for family lunch or dinner but better to book in advance, especially during weekends",Pyxida
50,"Very nice food, fresh fish nice atmosphere excellent for families and friends. Cosy inside during winter and very nice outside at night during summer time",Pyxida
50,"A well presented restaurant serving excellent quality fish dishes at reasonable prices. Two of our party has fish meze ......oh dear ...good food, well cooked but you need a huge appetite to do it justice _ don't eat before you go. The atmosphere was great too ...not touristy, mainly local people and a good vibe.",Pyxida
40,"This restaurant is the same as the restaurant Pyxida which is ranked number 1 in Tripadvisor for Nicosia. This is a fish tavern. In my opionion the best one of its kind in Nicosia but not in Cyprus. You should order the fish meze which includes fish soup. For wine I recommend ""Mosxofilero"" by Boutaris, it goes good with fish. The service is excellent. Only one time we had a problem with a waiter who insisted that we sit at a table near the street where it was very windy when the place was almos empty inside. He is from Greece (not Cyprus) but all the other waiters are very professional and friendly. I recommend this place if you are in Nicosia and you want to go out for fish. The price to quality ratio is very good compared to similar place e.g. Paragadi (complet rip-off).",Pyxida
50,"Very good variety of fish, everything was fresh, very tender the octopus!! Great service, friendly staff , always attentive.",Pyxida
40,"This is my second visit to Pixida, the food is great especially grilled menu. The appetizers are good, soup, salads, shrimps, and calamari. the main course was a variation of almost anything found in the sea.",Pyxida
30,Quite good but not my choice of a very good fish restaurant. The food is alright but the atmosphere is not that good unless you go with a large group of friends and you make your own.,Pyxida
50,"Is an excellent, family fish restaurant with fresh fish. Is located in a quiet area in Nicosia.The prices are normal.Also the service and the hospitality is excellent",Pyxida
50,The best fish tavern in nicosia only fresh fish service staff is very friendly and professional very good atmoshete,Pyxida
40,"It offers a great variety of fresh fish, grilled or fried, meze way. It combines the meze experience with a more upscale restaurant experience very harmonically. Expensive restaurant.",Pyxida
40,"Good fish restaurant but, in my opinion, unjustifiably expensive. Not really a tavern...it's not for family (ie with small children) or casual eating.I have to say that, compared to fish taverns in especially Greece, Cyprus just doesn't make the cut in terms of quality and value.",Pyxida
50,"Gorgeous food, with a wide selection and beautifully presented. The atmosphere is lovely and the restaurant is always full, so it's a good idea to book your table beforehand. The service is very nice and the restaurant is fairly upmarket! Have been there a number of time and have never been disappointed!",Pyxida
50,"Everything on the menu is tasty if you are a fish lover. Service is very good , people are friendly there. I recommend this restaurant especially at night.",Pyxida
40,"We had a very good variety of fish meze, all fresh and of high quality. The main dish (fish) was filleted and served as individual dishes which is very clever and practical when you have a business table of 24. If you combine it with the very nice environment of the store then you have a very good restaurant in the heart of Nicosia.",Pyxida
50,"the food was great, a little expensive but high quality food, nice place ( we ate at garden). good service, helpful staff. probably the best for fish meze in Nicosia.",Pyxida
40,"The place to go for fresh fish, and I mean it when I say fresh. As soon as you order the fish meze, dishes are starting to pile up. The staff is very friendly, and the owners are pretty involved with the management of the restaurant, thus the fresh fish and goof service. The ambiance of the place gives you the gives you the idea of a high end restaurant, thus the prices. A bit steep on the bill, but worth it every time.",Pyxida
30,"We went there after recommendations,bur we werent very impressed. They serve a range of choices, in medium to high prices and good size portions. We had fish and fish pasta which was OK nothing amazing. Not everything is fresh but they are honest about it. The worse thing was the service, quite slow for such a well-known place.",Pyxida
30,"The food was good, but nothing special and the service was relatively slow. It's a ok fish restaurant for Nicosia, but there is space for improvement.",Pyxida
40,If you end up in Nicosia Cyprus and you want to have a fair meal with delicious fish well cooked. Then this is th3 the right place.You need to make reservation it's always full.We have a great dinner. People were nice.You can skip the lemon sorbet not great,Pyxida
50,"Went with friends without booking and the terrace was full but we found place inside. We good service, fresh fish to be choosen and prices looked correct. A place to visit!",Pyxida
50,"Excellent food, hard to find as signage is all in greek. Service was fast once it started. Courses of Meze came fast and thick, all the fish dishes were fresh and well cooked. Would definitely recommend.",Pyxida
50,Fresh fish in central Nicosia. Excellent service and convenient parking. Soup at the beginning as a starter is a must try.,Pyxida
50,I have been in a lot of fish Tavern but this one is far the best ever. For sure I will visit the place again.,Pyxida
50,if we have customers who like fish in this restaurant you never feel embarassed as it is always very nice fish dishes,Pyxida
40,"It is a really nice restaurant for seafood lovers. I highly recommend the fish meze. They can fill you up easily; fresh fish, you can smell of the sea. However i went there, for a business lunch. It was way to busy, and we lost our reservation because we were late for about 15 minutes. If you would like to visit, you should book early.",Pyxida
50,"I have visited for lunch and dinner several times, and every single time the food has been superb.The fish meze is very filling and the fish is fresh and well cooked. It can get too busy at times so book early.It remains one of the top restaurants for seafood in Cyprus, even though it is expensive and in the current economic situation people seek lower prices.",Pyxida
40,"Tasty food, good atmposhere, a range of choices. I would recommend it. I ate there for lunch and i enjoyed it",Pyxida
40,"Been there for a business lunch ... a party of eight. Well, Pyxida is one sure place you may enjoy splendid fresh fish in a nice service and atmosphere. Prices though should be significantly reduced!",Pyxida
50,"A strong indication that some tastes might well be called ""universal"" is Pyxida Fish Tavern in Nicosia. Recently, we ate there with a group of academics from four different countries. Their response was overwhelmingly positive and, by some, truly enthusiastic. All representative dishes were perfectly cooked and presented, covering an impressive variety of fish both as appetizers and main courses. Exactly the same was the response of my Jewish-American friend and his Japanese wife, when we ate there some months ago. It seems to follow that Pyxida's choices and skills have apparently captured such fish-related tastes that do fascinate an enormous array of palates from all-over the world.",Pyxida
40,"This is a typically good but expensive Nicosia restaurant. Fish is pricey anyway, but if you have the money enjoy it, it's probably the among the best and healthiest foods to eat (provided we're not talking about the fried variety washed down with a keg of beer and a tub of taramosalata). Pyxida is reliable, clean and professional.",Pyxida
50,"This is one of the premier restaurants of Nicosia. I had taken an associate company here for an evening meal as they requested fish.The service is excellent - all the staff seem very well trained and attentive to your needs.The food was really good - everything was fresh, perfectly cooked and was enjoyed by all.I can thoroughly recommend Pyxida to anyone.",Pyxida
50,"Pyxida is the place i go for fish. i dont have any alternatives. The fish alwaes fresh, staff very frendly and polite. Nice outdoor seating.",Pyxida
40,Perfect service with a variety of fresh fish dishes of excellent quality. Lunches and dinners are offered daily wich somebody can enjoy during the whole week.,Pyxida
50,"Well deserved number 1 on tripadvisor. Got there early as we did not have a booking, still managed to get a nice table outside. Me and my girlfriend ate a 3 course dinner (fresh sea food) - dessert was complementary, seems to be procedure + bottle of Pinot Grigio for €60!!! Service hardly let me do anything and constantly alert. I'd recommend the cattle fish casserole.",Pyxida
30,"THe consistently good food, which is reasonably priced, is let down by the miserable staff! They show no interest in their customers, despite being efficient in serving and clearing tables, but not a 'thank you' or 'did you enjoy your meal' etc from any of them. Very disappointing",Pyxida
50,"I've been there for the first time, last month. On a nice spot in Nicosia, almost in the center of the town. The atmosphere is really nice as the waiters are really willing to help. Very reasonable prices for the food they serve, which is fresh, seafood.! I definitely recommend it.!",Pyxida
50,"When in cyprus don't miss to eat at this high-end fish cusine place, the menu is essential and basic in line with the local culinary tradition but everything is top quality.Unfortunately the have a so-so winecellar with no goteign wines and good local wines but no expertise in introducing them to the clients",Pyxida
50,Great selection of fish meze and always good. Very interesting dishes and very nice fresh fish. Recommended if you love fish,Pyxida
50,"After reading all the reviews and the hotel we were staying at also recommended this restaurant. I booked it for my husbands birthday and it surpassed both out expectations. We had gorgeous bread and the best houmous I have ever tried. We also ordered some baked olives and a salad along with our starters of sword fish and mushrooms. It all was all very tasty and the portions were really generous. We ordered a large red mullet to share which was beautifully presented with a selection of roasted vegetables. We would have liked to sample some desserts but we were so full after the meal we could only manage a coffee. The restaurant has impeccable service and was of the highest quality, if we're ever in Nicosia again we would make a point of visiting again.",Pyxida
50,This was by far the best meal and dining experience we had during our four days in Cyprus. The decor is very nice with tables spaced to give you some privacy on the covered patio. The entire meal was terrific with a delicious taramasalata and a tomato and a refreshing tomato and cucumber salad as appetizers. My wife's grilled cuttlefish was awesome and a very generous portion and my grilled calamari was perfectly done. Both were accompanied by the perhaps the best french fries we have ever had. The service was as good as the meal and the cost was very reasonably for the quality of meal. We wish this restaurant was located where we live as we would dine there at least once a week.,Pyxida
50,"Been there 2 days before I leave cyprus. Nice spot, almost in the center of the town. The waiters are very willing to help, and polite also. From the reviews I read, I thought that it was going to be very busy. It wasn't. Fresh seafood and a clean place and very reasonable prices. Reccomended for sure.!",Pyxida
50,"This place has been recommended by my friend, A local guy. It's just perfect. Service is friendly, seafood is fresh, prices are really reasonable. Best option for lunch in the center of the city. Restaurant is full during lunch time so try to book a table in advance.",Pyxida
50,Good value and really tasty food. Just too much ! Really nice venue. Always good service and an easy car park across the road.,Pyxida
40,"Fresh fish and excellent atmosphere. We ordered fish meze and it was more than we could eat. It starts with Cypriot cold meze followed by all sorts of calamari, sardines, calamari and octopus, fish and chips, sole fish, sultan fish, sea bream and sea bass. They were honest to tell you what was frozen and what was fresh.",Pyxida
50,"We made a reservation at this restaurant last night (Tuesday), as it was recommended that we did. We chose Greek salad, whitebait and halloumi cheese for starters, which arrived along with hommus and hot bread. The salad was the freshest, sweetest and crispest I have ever had, and the whitebait was extremely fresh and well cooked. For the main meal we had squid, which seemed a bit plain and was slightly over-cooked, perhaps even microwaved, plus swordfish suvlaki (on a skewer with vegetables), which was delicious. Overall, the service was fast and attentive. The mixture of cooked fish with crunchy veges was unusual, and I enjoyed it. I would definitely go back, especially since the price was reasonable. 50 euro with wine and a free dessert.",Pyxida
50,"We love fish and seafood and Cyprus offers a variety of exotic fish and seafood delicacies. the Compass restaurant is no exception. this was my first visit and my friends have been here before. They have their own private car park opposite which is very convenient. The fish soup was to my taste, the mezes, we had calamari, salad, tahini, olives all very well presented and tasty. The barbunia (red mullet) cooked just right. We finished off with halva and baklava, the baklava was done in a Cypriot style as opposed to Turkish or Arabic and was exquisite. Recommend.",Pyxida
50,"This place is really amazing, as a sea-food lover, I would give this place 8 out of 10, value for quality and atmosphere. I had the Mezze selection, arrived on time along side with our drinks. the quality was outstanding.I recommend this place and will deffinitly visit again",Pyxida
50,"Very nice restaurant, cozy yet big enough to fit large groups. Price is fair and food is prepared well. Staff is very alert. Good wine selection. They even have a lot to park in right across from restaurant. I have been twice now, I prefer to go on quiet nights as the service was speedier.",Pyxida
50,I went there last week for a business lunch. The fish soup is the best i tried and the salads and dips are fresh and tasty. The grilled sea-bass was very tasty and cooked to perfection. The prices are a bit high but reasonable for fresh fish. I visit this restaurant quite often and the quality is always consistent.The best seafood restaurant in Nicosia.,Pyxida
40,"This is an excellent fish restaurant, quite popular among Nicosia people. I also heard that foreign officials are often invited by local politicians/government officials. Very good food fresh fish, I especially loved the soup. The service is efficient and the decor is nice. The restaurant is centrally placed too so you can easily take a break at noon while shopping or dine before/after a drink.",Pyxida
50,"A frequent visit to this place, you will most likely be taken here by one of your business clients/partners to give you that 'impressive' feeling. Well you won't be disappointed. Excellent choice of fish (generally meze style (lots of little dishes) with a main fish course.Well done if you manage to finish all the dishes......but you'll certainly try as the food is great.With luck, someone else will pick up you bill.........but enjoy it all the same",Pyxida
40,Usually visit for lunch...Excellent food and service. Fish is always fresh and well cooked. Nice fish soup! Great place for a business lunch.,Pyxida
50,"It's not been alway possible to go to pyxida every time I visit Nicosia. It was nice to see that the standards have not slipped up a bit. For me pyxida is by far the best fish restaurant Nicosia has to offer. If you visit this place on a cold day, their fish soup is a must try. I usually enjoy this place better when I go with a large group of people as we get to create our own selection of fish meze. This is more or less what we did this time. We all had the fish soup to start with and shared some grill octopus, cuttlefish casserole in its ink and red mullet before we finished a wreckfish (vlachos). All of the above were perfectly cooked to maintain their delicate flavours and remain extremely tender and succulent. We also got a selection of dips and salads to enjoy with a the toasted local bread provided. They have an extensive and well thought wine selection to accompany your fish and your experience is crowned by the excellence of the service provided by a plethora of well trained staff. If you love fish and you are in Nicosia you have to visit this place.",Pyxida
50,"Simply the great fish restaurant, best balcan type - you can look at the today's catch and then choose the fish, etc that caught your eye, my local partner told me that this was one of the best in the city.",Pyxida
40,"the food is excellent and fresh, a variety of sea food, we had chosen fish meze. It has almost everything from appetizers, soup, to main dishes including fried and grilled fish, shrimps, and squids.",Pyxida
40,"Just came back from dinner at Pyxida fish tavern. The food was, as always, excellent, even the dessert. We had fish meze this time. Everything was oh, so delicious. Lots of food, lots of variety, excellent fish quality, very well cooked, and lots of quantity. The food was so much, there was no room to try everything. The fish soup was delicious as well, even though am not a fun of fish soup. Very nice and cosy atmosphere inside, as well. The service was excellent too! The bill was a bit on the pricy side, but we had too much wine, so that brought the price up. But, all in all, we had a great time at Pyxida fish tavern, and I would definitely go back.",Pyxida
40,"Straight up fish tavern. No surprises on the menu, the offerings are clear and plain. Taste of fish comes through and they are fresh and excellently cooked.On the negative side, a bit expensive and the decor could be a bit more exciting.The posh feeling of the restaurant makes it ideal for business lunches.",Pyxida
50,"I was taken here by work colleagues, and the food was spectacular. Be sure to come hungry -- the portions are HUGE and a fair bit of it is fried so it's not a light experience. But in terms of getting to try a bunch of local dishes, it's hard to beat!",Pyxida
50,"Fresh fish , large collection of dishes good service. Reservation is required.I went there with my family we ordered hot appetizers of or choose like taramasalata, grilled octopus, fried soft crab shell, marinated octopus, grilled sardine and the best was mussels in white wine sauce n garlic.",Pyxida
40,"Very tasty dishes and very well prepared. Lots of choices in the menu and the service is really good. I was impressed with the food quality of this restaurant.Recommendation: Combine your plate with a glass of wine!Also, in busy days (like weekends) make a reservation two days before.",Pyxida
50,Good food at excellent Price. Had starters mains and som nice desserts. Nice service from a Good team of waiters.,Pyxida
40,"Visited on a very busy sunday afternoon for lunch Food: EXCELLENT mouth watering experience for all see food/ fish i tried! Atmosphere: average, slightly noisy fory taste Service: very polite, place well staffed for a busy sunday",Pyxida
40,Fresh lovely seafood. Nice way of serving food. Tough service though but still good service. The place is cozy.,Pyxida
30,Pyxida is probably one of the two most expensive fish restaurants in town. The food is fresh but does not justify the higher price. Nice decoration,Pyxida
40,"Reservations is a must there ,they also have parking space but for limited like 10 -12 cars maximum I like the Fish or meat meze both good choices",Pyxida
20,"I don't really understand the hype with this restaurant. We both took the fish meze, but almost every dish was deep fried, which for me doesn't show any skills in fish preparation. The first thing on the table was some typical cypriot dips, some were really good, other a bit tasteless, served with bland industrial bread. After that, the small plates kept coming, almost all of them deep fried (deep fried prawns, deep fried calamari, deep fried small crabs, deep fried white fish, you get the picture). At the very end came (at last) a very tasty whole fish cooked in the oven, but I felt so stuffed with all these greasy meze I had before that I couldn't manage to appreciate it.Maybe we were unlucky with the meze menu that particular time, or maybe I'm too used to eat in gastronomic restaurants, but the whole dinner was so... unchallenging for my tastebuds,i felt like i was given a giant ""children menu"".The worst was probably the service, not rude but cold, and none of the many waiters bothered to present the food they were serving, which is rather weird when serving a ""discovery"" meze menu. Not too expensive, but all in all not worth it either.",Pyxida
50,"Be it a romantice night out or with a group of friends, this restaurant is fantastic. The food is amazing and very reasonably priced, the wine is fabulous and the decor is very romantic! Dont leave Cyprus without trying this restaurant, you wont be disappointed!",Pyxida
50,Do not miss this restaurant! I was there with a group of colleagues and tried sea food as never before! :),Pyxida
50,"Best choice in order to combine value for money and adequate quantity, should be meze. Priced at €23.50, the meze is quite rich. The quality of the food is more than satisfactory. What is also a plus for this restaurant is that both the quantity and the quality are always the same. The restaurant itself is an old house which is well maintained and its architectural aura provides calmness and simplicity. Overall, a very good choice for sea food in the Capital.",Pyxida
50,"Great food, as much as you cannot eat. Better start early, the dinner will take 3 hrs at least. I liked the atmosphere, as well, simple, nothing fancy, great value for a little money.",Pyxida
50,"Fabulous and filling lobster based pasta, preceded by numerous fish-based mezze. Staff look after your every need with a flourish.",Pyxida
50,We have been 3 times in Pyxida. The fish- soup is excellent and the fish very fresh. There we first taste AHS AMBELIS wine that is very nice local wine.,Pyxida
50,"It is not the only fish and seafood restaurant in Nicosia but for sure, one of the best :)I have been at this restaurant a few times and every time it was a great pleasure.the specialties I had enjoyed: 1. the beer is always serving cold all over the meal 2.the baked olives are amazing .A very good Services.",Pyxida
30,a nice tavern in nicosia most fish is fresh - but expensive - other more economic options in nicosia,Pyxida
50,I couldn't return to Varoshiotis in Larnaca due to my short trip in Cyprus. My local friend recommended Pyxida and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good fish mezze if you are in a hurry and great value for money!,Pyxida
40,"Pyxida is more than a fish tavern, it is probably the capital's only fish restaurant. The tables are properly laid with the appropriate cutlery, crockery and glasses; the service, friendly and helpful as one would expect at a tavern, are also a lot more courteous and proper but not overbearing. We chose the mezze on this particular visit. And what a revelation it was. It is a never ending conveyor belt of almost universally fresh and well cooked fish based Cypriot dishes. The doggy bag we took back home fed the family for two more days!!!The ubiquitous salad and dips are run of the mill and do not match the quality of the fish dishes. I can think of two ways of improving this situation. Either go for the freshest ingredients, top quality products and in house preparation according to Cypriot traditional cuisine; or have a look at what the more imaginative and ground breaking fish establishments are doing in Greece.I have no such qualms about the hot fish dishes. The ingredients are top notch and fresh, the cooking is traditional but excellent. The octopus casserole is tender, with the appropriate, well prepared Cypriot/Levantine thick spicy onion and wine jus. The new born crabs are served fried in light batter and are deliciously crispy. Cod is served in the British fish 'n chips manner but with attention to perfect frying and arrives almost grease free, crispy outside and flaky/steaming on the inside. They should attempt making their own ketchup. Pan fried red mullet is among the best I have eaten. The fish is of the smaller free range size and retains the aromas and flavours of the Med. The mounds of grilled prawns were of a very impressive size if a little overcooked as is the case universally in Cyprus, but the olive oil-and-lemon dressing and fresh parsley made up for it. Pity about the three average sized sea-bream; they were completely mashed in the boning process. Greater pity still, the stale Lebanese Mahallebi sweet that comes as standard.The wine list is the standard fare of the better Cyprus restaurants. On all other occasions we ate a la carte and this is when Pyxida is certainly very expensive. The rich mezze on the other hand, including wine, water and tips came to less than €30 per head.If one is looking for a good traditional Cypriot fish restaurant, Pyxida may rightly claim to be among the top in Nicosia. A little more imagination/flair and a glance at where 21st century Mediterranean and indeed Greek fish cuisine is heading to nowadays will not go amiss, though.",Pyxida
50,very good food. price is well fitted for the quantities and quality of the fish served! Must have plates is the fish meze and the asprovlaxos fish which you wont regret. Always fresh fish unlike other restaurants I've recently visited near by pyxida. Highly recommended!,Pyxida
40,Very good fish and quite good service but: - make sure you sit outside as inside it is quite outdated - be prepared to wait (or book early) - be prepared to pay a lot!,Pyxida
50,#NAME?,Pyxida
40,"Food quality is very good with a good selection of dishes. Good wine list, but limited beer selection. Service is excellent and staff is really friendly. Go for ""Fish Meze"" you will never regret it.",Pyxida
50,"The best Fish Tavern in all of Cyprus; excellent and rich mezze at very reasonable price, and fresh fish of all kinds available all days.",Pyxida
50,"We were lucky to visit the tavern while they served fresh mussels. All the fish was more than perfect, the soup was gorgeous but mussels... mussels were a true gift from heaven. We developed our love for mussels in Bretagne and we thought it could not be tasting any better until visiting Pixida Tavern. We are definitely going there again. No complaints — the service was great, the bill was a bit pricey but not more than expected.",Pyxida
50,We had a great night and excellent food and service.,Pyxida
50,My partner and I had our dinner in Pyxida on our holiday in April. We chose this restaurant after we had read positive reviews on the Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. We chose fish meze and the food kept arriving over the period of two hours. The only complaint I may have about this restaurant is that they serve so much food that it was impossible for us to try everything. I was absolutely stuffed. The quality of food was amazing and the service was great - efficient yet not overwhelming. The restaurant was absolutely full when we arrived so make sure you book it in advance and enjoy the feast!!!,Pyxida
50,"Perfect for Fish.Although it is in Nicosia and not by the coast this restaurant serves one of the best fish selections on the Island.Friendly service, prices on the higher side but the value for money justifies every penny.I went their probably 5-7 times on different occasions including birthday, dinner for two and business lunch.My opinion: If you haven’t try it then go today :)",Pyxida
50,"The meal starts off with an awesome fish soup and the awesome fish just continues right through the meal. Since we had a few vegetarians with us, we ordered some of the vegetarian stuff as well and I must say it was awesome- right from salads to different beans and lentils - really good.The fruit platter is a great way to end the meal - excellent sampling of all the fresh and juicy fruits available in Cyprus and of course the vermicelli based dessert - simply yum :).The best way to describe the food is - fresh food with simple flavors.Not to be left behind the service staff make sure that the dining experience is great.",Pyxida
40,This is a pricy restaurant by you are sure to enjoy nicely cooked fish here. I tried the meze which contained a range of fish cooked in various ways and it was filling. They also bring a complementary sweet at the end which is nice too!,Pyxida
50,"The very top in sea food, friendly & pleasant staff, cozy environment, ample parking. Advance booking necessary.",Pyxida
40,"Been there severa times. It serves amazing food... If you go in winter, you must try the fish-soup.. Simply perfect. Staff is very friendly.. Overall a great experience everytime i go. You will go back for sure...",Pyxida
50,"We asked a nice girl at the reception about the best fresh fish restaurant she could recommend in Nicosia. She asked friends, and told us Pixida. We booked it, ate there, and it was wonderful.Almost as good as the Fumia in Valletta, one of my favourite fish restaurants in the world. Well recommended.",Pyxida
30,To be fair its reputation is well justified. The food is good and the interior is nicely decorated. But it can be too crowded at times and when you are seated in the side yard you don't have enough space to seat comfortably and you are almost attached to the other tables. Apart from that everyone there is well dressed and their prices are quite high. It's not where I would go with my friends regularly to have fish,Pyxida
40,Excellent seafood restuarant. Gets very full so book in advance. Not cheap but worth it for the fresh fish and ambience.,Pyxida
50,"The best fish soup I ever tasted.Must-try fish croquettes (just order one per person, not two, they are large)OK calamari.Very tasty garlic shrimps.OK sea bass.Good local wine selection. Reasonable prices.Excellent service.I'll definitely be going again. I hope to try Greek shrimps, Italian shrimps next time.You can see the menu before you go on their website.Don't forget to make a reservation.",Pyxida
50,I visited Pyxida a lot of times. It's the ideal restaurant if you have important clients or associates to take for lunch. Always excellent fish - the best in Nicosia in my opinion.,Pyxida
40,pyxida has quality fish food. the service is very quick. a little expensive i would say,Pyxida
50,"Ive been to Pyxida many times and always there is very nice and fresh fish, it has a great selection of dishes and a fantastic fishsoop.Very good service, and as it is in the city center you can go easily for business lunch.Highly recommended",Pyxida
50,"Fresh Fish well cooked. You can get Fish meze where you will have a variety of plates with fish, squid, octobus, salad, fish soup etc. which is a cheaper option but if you wish to really enjoy the fish then you can order big grilled fish which you have to option to select from a large variety and this is weighted in front of view so that you know before hand how much you are approximately going to pay. You can accompany your grilled fish with fresh squid, octobus, red mullet for starters with green salad. There is a great variety of wines from all over the world including local wines. My preference is Cypriot White Chartonnay from Kyperounta famous winery. The cost per person including drinks varies from 25 - 50 Euros.",Pyxida
40,"Pyksida represents exactly what Cypriots mean when they eat fish. I can't speak for other cities but for Nicosia this is the best fish restaurant. The food is as fresh and minimal as possible: Lemon, olive oil, parsley. Mainly grilled dishes (the bigger fish, octopus, squid) or fried (you can request this) and nice healthy potatoes and veggies on the side (really good, these could be a course on their own for a non-fish eating customer).There's not a huge variety of dishes but there really shouldn't be. What you get is what is fresh, good and available at that point. You can't really go wrong with Pyksida's food. As a restaurant, it runs like a swiss clock due to the owner always being around, talking with customers and making sure everything is as it should be. As a busy, in-demand place it sets an example on good restaurant management. I've seen Pyksida literally packed many times but this has never affected the service or food. The waiters are experienced, swift and helpful. It gets extremely busy so book well in advance.Pyksida is also good for a business lunch. Recommended dishes : the fish soup, asprovlahos fish, fried calamari (flawless), and atherina (when available). Combine these with some dips and salads and a good white wine and you can't go wrong!",Pyxida
30,Food was really good and this only can be convincing for somebody to give this a try and even go there more than once. It worths it although a bit pricey. Pity the service was not so good. We found personnel unfriendly and even picking up the dishes before we really finish.in any case I would give this a second try (not in my priorities though)...maybe things have changed.,Pyxida
50,"I believe that this is the best fish restaurant in Cyprus and so do many of my friends. I’ve heard many times that is overpriced but I don’t agree, the amount of food and its quality match the prices here and in many fish taverns they don’t.Pixida is very popular for a business lunch/dinner, and really no wonder, especially if you want to show your clients best of Cyprus. Food is always fresh and delicious, service perfect, really the best you get in any restaurant around the island. And there is nothing else to add.",Pyxida
40,"A restaurant with many years of experience, appreciated from locals. Great food, not the cheapest but defanetly worth it. The service is brilliant.",Pyxida
40,"Our family loves seafood and we have been to a lot of seafood joints in both the north and south of the island. Pyxida is the best.Food is of excellent quality, with fresh & crispy salad, incredible potatoes, excellent tarama, etc. Seafood is always fresh and well prepared.Service is also very good.The open air location is quite nice but the inside dining rooms are a little tasteless decorationwise. Uninspiring might I say.My only complaint would be that they tend to overcook shrimps and sometimes fish. This is a general problem on the island so I'm tempted to say its a cultural thing. In both the north and south, seafood (and meat) is always overcooked. But at least Pyxida does not burn the stuff :)To sum up, although not perfect, this is the closest you will get to a classy seafood restaurant in Cyprus. As a result expect to pay more but it is worh the price.",Pyxida
50,They make the best fish soup ever! This place is 5 stars!,Pyxida
50,"Great place! Very friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, perfect food. All you ever need.",Pyxida
50,This place is simply unbeatable! Great fresh fish and consistent quality for years! Service is excellent and you feel like real customer here. This is the only restaurant in town I would any time invite some important out of town guests. I love this place! Keep doing what you do best!,Pyxida
50,"A great selection of fish at its best. but for those who don't know much about sea food, you will have to guess as the waiters are not mentioning what's on your plate.",Pyxida
50,"If you like fresh food it's the place to go. Everything is fresh, a bit expensive though. The quantity is huge and every time we feel sorry because we can't eat everything!",Pyxida
50,I am not a fish friend but that's the place I only go for fish.,Pyxida
40,"My favorite part was the potatoes. I almost never eat them without yoghur, but these ones were very good. I know I'm supposed to talk about the fish more, but, honestly, that kind of seafood/fish you can find in other fish taverns in Nicosia as well. But those potatoes, you can't",Pyxida
50,"A group of 6 of us went to this restaurant for a fish meze. The food was outstanding, service excellent, portions huge & really good value for money. The fish meze was 20 euros which works out cheaper than Wagamama next door but far superior food. Definitely a regular restaurant to add to my list.",Pyxida
50,This is the best seafood place on the island. It is very fresh and very well prepared,Pyxida
