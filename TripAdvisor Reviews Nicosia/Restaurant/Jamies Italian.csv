30,I must say food was excellent made to perfection. One problem server waitress was not the best we had children she didn’t tell us about the free refills with children meals and I thought she was rude no customer service at all. But the manager I spoke with was outstanding very apologetic to us. Carolina I think her name was. Manager brilliant staff not to good. Apart from that good will visit again because of Carolina xx,Jamies Italian
30,"The food and drinks were great, you do get what you pay for.However, the service was horrible. One of the servers kept putting his hands in front of one of our guests, completely disregarding of her presence at the table.We asked the same server if there were whiskey options (as there are no whiskey options on the menu) and when asked about a specific whiskey option he said he would go and check and he never did.Both servers wanted to get our order from the stairs behind the table, rather than coming close to our table.They offer food that is not on their menu. For example, the Brownie states that it comes with caramelised popcorn, however, it comes with a vanilla ball of ice cream. (It needs to be specified for allergen purposes)The drink service was incredibly slow.",Jamies Italian
50,I eat the best bolognese in my life. The meat was so nicely cooked and the sauce incredible. The pasta was so fresh and the service very friendly and professional.,Jamies Italian
50,"We went here for my birthday meal, and as it was midweek we got their set menu, which was a great deal, 3 course for 18.50 euros if I remember correctly or something along those lines! Each course had a great portion size, garlic bread for starter was 4 bread rolls, amazing carbonara for main with good ham to pasta ratio, and then this delicious caramel brownie which melted in your mouth with popcorn, sauce and ice cream for dessert again very good size brownie compared to other restaurants. As it was my birthday they even wrote happy birthday on my plate and gave me a candle. Really sweet and caring staff! Drinks were good prices too. As this was one of our best meals in Nicosia we decided to return, this was on the weekend which was a lot busier we decided to try something different off the menu which were very nice but couldn't beat the carbonara! Very Yummy and would definitely go again... as I did!",Jamies Italian
40,Jamie’s Italian gone from U.K. but still in Cyprus. It was good to try some old classics including the tempura style mushrooms and veggie burger. The drinks service was exceptionally slow here.,Jamies Italian
40,A previous reviewer implied that this is a Michelin star restaurant! Believe me It’s NOT. Far from it. And definitely not the best restaurant in Nicosia. Again far from it. Nevertheless it’s a good everyday restaurant and expensive for what it is (as far as Cyprus prices go). The service is good and so is the ambiance. Good for lunch or a casual dinner.,Jamies Italian
50,"This is the best restaurant in Nicosia since I'm interested in cooking, the food is expensive but cheap for Michelin star level food and they have an extensive selection of charcuterie. I'd go there often if I were rich",Jamies Italian
50,"We 've been at Jamie's Italian quite a few times as a family of four and every time was better than the last! Seating is very comfortable (especially the booths!) and the decoration and atmosphere is very pleasant. We tried many different items on the menu and everything was fantastic! All plates have an inventive twist of taste so you have to be open minded! Burgers have their own unique additions and taste, no ketchup or mayo needed! Pasta is great, chicken comes in various forms, all very well presented especially the chicken al mattone and cacciatore. Side dishes are also very interesting and great tasting, starting from the fluffy garlic bread up to the fantastic mildly spiced raviolli fritti! We also tried the home delivery and the food reached us in about 35 minutes, warm and as good as in the restaurant. We will definitely go back and order delivery again. Highly recommended!",Jamies Italian
50,"The opening hours are great - many places are closed with Jamie's is always open. Can always guarantee excellent food quality. Music, furniture, the feel and cleanliness are brilliant as well. Staff are fantastic and never make you feel rushed - quite the opposite! Make you feel right at home, I often come to have lunch and study.But they're also very efficient when you need to be quick.Very reasonable prices and menu is diverse which often changes with the seasons and festivities.Cannot recommend high enough for any event; business, family, friends, study/solo, anything...Very accommodating. I hope it stays here forever.",Jamies Italian
30,Drinks and starters are awesome. The mains leave a lot to be desired.Good for a quick business dinner or casual couples night.,Jamies Italian
30,"The menu is quite impressive. The portions however are tiny (especially the pasta) and the food is nothing special. Everything on the menu is quite pricey, from starters till desserts, drinks etc Friendly staff.",Jamies Italian
50,I ate pasta.It was very very delicious! At the end I ate chocolate cake with ice cream! Fantastic! Jamie's Italian is my favourite italian restaurant.,Jamies Italian
50,"The food was lovely, service was exceptional waiters polite and friendly restaurant clean and felt like home",Jamies Italian
10,"The pasta didn't have any sauce or mushrooms and it was very dry and it was tasteless. The burger was entirely rare (red) and we were afraid to eat it. In general, the meal was terrible and I have heard bad comments from others as well.",Jamies Italian
20,"The food in this restaurant is of good quality but the same is not true as far as service is concerned. Waiting times are rather long, and in my case a different plate was served from the one I had ordered. The prices are rather high as well...",Jamies Italian
40,"Tasty food, nice atmosphere, but pricey. Very nice especially for families. Good service. would recommend it.",Jamies Italian
40,"Been there with the family! The lasagne, pizza and burger were excellent! Everyone enjoyed it them! However their pappardelle bolognese were awful! No taste from the minced meat and the pasta overcooked! The service was great though.",Jamies Italian
50,"I visited the restaurant yesterday with my family !I was impressed with the service, quality of food, service and the decor of the store. We were escorted to our reserved table by one nice hostess lady and the manager approached our table and greeted us. The food is amazing. All cooked a la minute and fresh.A real authentic Italian cuisine. We highly recommend Jamie's Italian :)",Jamies Italian
20,"Nothing special in their menu. This time our 3 burgers were average and were all cooked the same even though we ordered them well done and medium. Salads were ok, risotto was poor.This was my 4th visit since they opened and I can't see any improvement. Sorry but it's a big disappointment for me especially for the money we paid.",Jamies Italian
40,"The food was really nice, especially the funghi pizza which was weird and interesting. We asked for a birthday treat on our dessert and they spelled Happy Birthday as ""Happy Oirthday"" which really confused me and I couldn't sleep at night.",Jamies Italian
40,Staff was very politeFood was of average qualityPortions are tinyI would say that this not a value for price place,Jamies Italian
10,"Do not recommend. Portions are tiny, food is average and service is slow. The value for money is very poor.",Jamies Italian
20,I really don’t understand all the hype behind this place. On the main door the host started arguing with her colleague about wether or not there were available tables for two for us that came without reservation. It felt like we are not welcomed. They gave us a small round table in the corner of the room. The table was shaking and seemed a bit dirty too. The food reminded us an overpriced fast food. That’s all. Not the best experience.Was the first and the last time we went there.,Jamies Italian
30,The food was medium to bad...the staff was polite but when we requested extra topping for our pasta they they did not mention extra charge which was what overpriced our total bill which wasn’t worth it.,Jamies Italian
40,I love Greek food but the prevalence of large Meze platters means that occasionally I crave something different. For that reason we tried Jamie’s Italian. It was close to our our and well rated. I had always had a high opinion of Jamie Oliver and expected him to run a professional restaurant. It did not disappoint.We started with an order of garlic bread — slightly Untraditional in a good way. I had the steak. My daughter had pasta. We closed the meal with tiramisu and panacotta. Every dish was very good.The room was nice and modern and the service was excellent.,Jamies Italian
40,We visited again this restaurant with family and children. The food was very good and the staff very polite and friendly.,Jamies Italian
40,"Well prepared food. A family of 5 we shared starters and desserts. A plethora of amazing smells and tastes. The service was OK, we ordered garlic bread but got calamari, this was corrected and we got the calamari for free. The bill was reasonable and the wait time was just right. A great place for a family lunch on a hot summer day. Just get a parking with some shade.",Jamies Italian
30,"The interior design of the place is gorgeous! But the food doesn't match. We veggie burger was medium at best. I ordered gluten free pasta, the Penne were overcooked and fall apart every time I tried to stick my fork in it. I expected more!",Jamies Italian
30,"Have been a number of time given its close to where we live in Engomi, but its average as an Italian. The pizza's have a good crispy thin base, however the toppings can be good or bad depending on the chef, little sparse pieces of meat which is dissappointing. Also they seem reluctant to change toppings on pizza?The gnocchi is tasty and enjoyable, but the risotto was highly salted.The kids meals aren't very tasty at all, very salty and my daughter kept asking for more and more water and in the end didnt finish her food. She ordered a childrens meal and got mini spaghetti and meatballs , but the meatball was lost in a sea of tomato passata.Its fine for a group of friends as its a big venue and good atmosphere but dont expect great Italian food like Jamies Italian in England or Ireland",Jamies Italian
50,This is a very nice Italian restaurant ! Prices are a bit expensive but the quality is really good !!,Jamies Italian
50,"We visit the restaurant with some friends.. the food excellent. I liked freid mushrooms. I order a Rib Eye. Well cooked as per my request, the portion good enough. It's a place to eat in a non hurry atmosphere. Saff positive and always ready to help. Prices, a bit expensive but the quality pays off. I strongly recommend!",Jamies Italian
30,"We visit this restaurant to just eat pizza. It was very tasty, fluffy sides formed by thin dough and very thin dough in the center. But the dough on the edges and below strongly burned, sometimes charred. Moussaka is very tasty with a pleasant tomato sauce. Ordered garlic bread was a magnificent pampushkas with garlic sauce inside. Italian bottled beer was not impressed. There was a Russian-speaking waitress. The staff seemed too intrusive.",Jamies Italian
20,We only had main dishes and was rather disappointing to notice that the pasta bolognese was over salty and the same was the wild mushroom pasta. Both dishes arrived rather cold only the pizzas were tasty. Service could be better as the restaurant was quite busy at the time. The kids play area was very dirty and half the toys were broken. For a family oriented restaurant this is quite negative atmosphere.,Jamies Italian
10,"A branded convenience food place that does not meet the expectation suggested by its name.Staff was not well trained, had difficulties to uncork a bottle of wine, a second bottle and different waiter was the solution.Food was not bad as convenience food (I mean between fast food and normal restaurant style), for those who like it.The place seems to be quite popular, though. But populaity on its own is not necessarily a sign of quality.",Jamies Italian
50,Excellent service excellent decor excellent food excellent prices excellent whole experience good to book online which is very easy to avoid not getting in as very busy but doesn’t feel crowded or busy lovely atmosphere will be returning again for sure,Jamies Italian
30,"I have been at Jamies before and I enjoyed it. Last visit was quite disappointing.Salad was not so fresh, main dish linguini was very heavy, and dessert was average.",Jamies Italian
50,"Whether you visit with friends or with your special half, the experience is always great.The atmosphere is so inviting and the staff are very friendly, polite and knowledgeable. I believe they can help satisfy their most demanding customers.One of the things I really like is that their menu is changing frequently and it never gets saturated. I always enjoy their freshly made pasta and exquisite sauce, as well as their steaks and famous burgers.All dishes imho are great value for money.I think the music fits quite well with the cozy environment too.keep up the good work!",Jamies Italian
20,"No wonder why Jamies are closing shops in UK . This one was no different. Mediocre food and not value for money. Staff with very basic training ,dyeing concept.",Jamies Italian
30,Good service. Nice atmosphere. Food below average. I ordered the salmon and it came with yoghurt. Why would you make such a combination? Revolting. The lasagna was a puddle of tomato and cheese with some pasta underneath.,Jamies Italian
30,"I've been to Jamie's Italians mostly in London.This one in Nicosia has pretty much the same cosy decoration and general settings. Went there for lunch. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We had garlic bread, a salad and pasta. The portions were large and the tastes acceptable. I expected a bit better considering the flavours I am used to in England. The prices as expected in Jamie's. Overall a good experience. Would come back again.",Jamies Italian
40,"It's a casual lovely place for dinner with friends or with family. We definitely overdressed for the occasion. A pair of jeans and a nice top would have sufficed. The place is nicely decorated and the staff very friendly and welcoming. We had garlic bread, salad and the squid for starters which were all delicious. For mains we had a pizza and three pasta dishes. They were pretty good but to be honest I expected more variety in the pasta dishes. The ravioli portion was quite smaller than we anticipated but because we had starters it worked out in the end. What really pleased me though were the desserts and the coffee. We had the brownie and a pie with blueberries I think and they were out of this world. The coffee was very good quality too although I feel it was a bit overpriced. It is a restaurant, therefore, coffee shouldn't be charged like you are going to Starbucks. another downside was the fact that the place was rather noisy so if you are looking for a place to have a romantic dinner with your significant other, this isn't it. However, if you are looking for a place to have a nice night out with friends and family this is fine. For four people and a couple of beers, starters, coffees, a liqueur shot and desserts we paid around 120 euros.",Jamies Italian
50,"Amazing food, great atmosphere and friendly staff. Went with my girlfriend we both really liked it. Definitely recommend it.",Jamies Italian
10,That was the 2nd time and the last one for me..1. We had to call them... so they come to the veranda and give our order2. Glasses on the table upside down... on the table3. Nachos... what is this fried thing like Cyprus boukek with fried oil taste4. The Vegetarian burger should be served ALONE.... all the rest in the burger just destroy the taste and give's you a stomachache5. The spinach/ ricotta ravioli... change the name of the dish please... try this: Oily tomato black pepper sauce ravioli...6. Margarita Pizza... love your base but again... oil drilling from everywhere...7. This is the best one... Our toddler's lettuce was NOT PROPERLY WASHED... they replaced it... and again NOT PROPERLY WASHED.. they replaced it and again ... you could see the soil on the lettuce...Thanks for the discount but nothing comes before our health especially if it concerns our children.PS. Olive oil is great but you have to know how to use it...,Jamies Italian
50,"Amazing food, environment and service. Everyone was welcoming and pleasant. The food was delicious! 100% would visit again",Jamies Italian
30,"The restaurant is fabulous when it comes to the decoration and the comfortability in sitting and having a nice evening. But to be honest, the food taste compared to the prices, it's not reasonable. I did try mostly 70% of their menu. But nothing let me say, ""I will come to this place again"". To that extent, I rated it 3*",Jamies Italian
40,"Having heard a lot about the place we decided to go there for dinner. The place is cosy and modern, the service is good and the food is what expected. One thing to add is that the salad has to be upgraded or price reduced. Overall it is a nice place to go in Nicosia.",Jamies Italian
50,"At the beginning, as Italian it sounded weird to me. However, it has been pleasant and surprising. Super cordial and professional staff (we got really lucky having Alkisti who made our dinner unique)And very nice re-arrangement of Italian recepices :)Super recommend!",Jamies Italian
50,"Everything was really good.Very polite and friendly staff,really tasty food and nicely decorated and warm environmentAmazing ""handmade"",as they informed us limoncello !I would really like to come back!!!",Jamies Italian
50,"As always, the food was amazing, excellent service, and quality environment for a very successful business lunch",Jamies Italian
30,Nice ambienceGood serviceNice plate presentationBad quality ribeye Steak for 30 euroSoggy friesSalad OverdressedExpensive for what you get,Jamies Italian
40,"Went here on December 26th with no idea what to expect. It could have gone either way really, but the review score looked decent, so I gave it a try.The food was good and what we were given met my expectations. The starters and main dishes were cooked and prepared well. Despite it being busy, the food came relatively quickly.Parking is more than adequate as there is a huge car park.The service was attentive and quick. It was, however, not possible for us to determine who, if in fact anyone, was our designated waiter/waitress. We were served by several people. Not a problem I suppose - we always managed to get someone's attention very quickly and got what we wanted without any hassle.The only issues we had were the tables were a bit close together and towards 4pm the place was very full and reasonably noisy.",Jamies Italian
20,Took my mom for lunch there as a treat to her. We ordered Rocket salad and polenta chips and decided to share a lasagna (definitely a good idea when we saw the portion which could have fed 3 people easily if eatable)...The Rocket was not really rocket (tiny leafs and no tasteless) with some of the roots not even cut off. Then the lasagna came we got really desappointed: overcooked and felt like pre-masticated with bad odour emanating from it. Felt they served us some left over from 3 weeks ago. It was disgusting so neither I or my mom could eat it. We left our plates aside. Nobody came to ask us if there was a problem with the food until 10 minutes later when we had our jackets on our back standing and ready to go..... I will not go back there and there are way too many good restaurants in Nicosia to waste my money being served that type of food again.,Jamies Italian
50,"Me and my boyfriend visit the restaurant at least 3 times a month and we have never left the restaurant disappointed. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is good and the staff is extremely nice. You have to try mashroom soup!We’ve tired lots of other restaurants in Nicosia but Jamies is still our favorite. We even joke that Jamies will always be there to welcome you home. :) :)",Jamies Italian
40,"When you're a little tired of kabob and sharwma, then pop on over to Jamie's and try the pasta! Nice atmosphere, good food, similar to Olive Garden in the States",Jamies Italian
20,"Family visit for Sunday lunch. The only thing that was okay was the service. Nothing else.Firstly the place was packed(OK, I know, Sunday) and it was really hot.The food was really bad and I'm going to give you the full details on all the dishes:Starter: ""Crispy squid"": oily, served in the wrong plate and the sauce not in a small dipping bowl but all over the place.Mains: Prawn linguini: uncooked pasta and extremely watery dish. Looked like ramen noodles.Risoto: cooked well but really salty.Kids dish: Chicken skewers: looked like hospital food. 4-5 skewers of uneven big grilled chichen pieces served with half-boiled half-grilled sweet potato ""chips"" and a salad bowl with a cherry tomato cut in half, 2-3 carrot sticks and a piece of(not fresh) lettuce. 7,5 euros for that and extra for the kids drink.Dessert: ""epic"" tiramisu: a frosen ball of thick chocolate, that if you managed to break through you could find the hidden tiramisu. Nothing like the tiramisu served in the huge ice cream bowl in the past.And for that and a beer and a bottle of water we paid 60 euros.This is not the first time we had issues. Last time I had contacted the restaurant, they apologised and offered a free family lunch any time . Which I never used, cause after all, my intention is not to get free food, but improve the place so that we can enjoy our visits.Not going back for sure. This was the last time. We are extremely disappointed we wasted a great pre-Christmas Sunday lunch.",Jamies Italian
40,We have visited this restaurant with family and children. The food was very good and the service was very good.,Jamies Italian
40,"I wasn't sure of what to expect of Jamie's Italian in Nicosia. The reason being that I was used to seeing Oliver on TV and didn't know if what special he prepared could be made and offered in large quantities. Thankfully, I was wronged. The tomato salad, the pork chop and the penne with mushrooms, were delicious. One thing though..the main dishes were not properly hot, and that makes me wonder. Besides that, the staff was friendly and very helpful. The setting has a nostalgic touch, from the main entrance to the toilets. It should avoided during Saturdays and Sundays due to many young kids screaming and wandering about. It would also add to the whole image, if you were offered some bread with olives when seated.",Jamies Italian
30,We decided to go for a family lunch at Jamie’s Italian after all the good reviews. The environment and service was nice. The food was ok but not exceptional. The ultimate plank was the best of all our plates.,Jamies Italian
50,"The best restaurant ! Friendly staff and perfect food!! Try the super food salad, porcini tagliatelle and of course the epic chocolate brownie for dessert! Love it!!",Jamies Italian
40,Don’t expect a gourmet experience. You get what one expects from a Jamie’s restaurant. Just above average food at a reasonable price with a good experience. I would go back for a family outing but not for a special night.,Jamies Italian
50,"We do go to this restaurant on a fairly regular basis and, in fact, celebrated my 75th birthday and later in the year our 50th wedding anniversary there. First off the staff are excellent and have been extremely well trained they truly to project the desire to give you the best dining experience from the manager down. This time we went at lunch time which, during the week, has a limited menu but the charges are incredible. I started with crab on buschetta with aioli - so good the aioli so complemented the crab they worked really well together. I then went on to a plain pizza but the only thing plain about it is its simplicity - the tomato sauce was one of the best I have ever tasted. My beloved had tagliatelle bolognese which was excellent and you are offered as much fresh parmesan as you wish, grated there and then for you. He finished with their wonderful panna cotta with blackberries and chocolate - wonderfully wobbly and not at all like blancmange. And for that wonderful feast we had change from 22 euros and enough 'left overs' to feed us tonight!",Jamies Italian
50,Honestly this is the best place to go and it quality Italian cuisine in Nicosia. There salad and pasta dishes are amazing and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to go out and eat with a lovely and even romantic atmosphere,Jamies Italian
50,"Great food, great service. What else to say. I have to travel from the other end of Nicosia, but it is worth it. Superb.!",Jamies Italian
20,"I honestly really wanted to like this place! This was my third visit and I have now definitely confirmed that the food is generally bland and boring! I had the Pork Milanese this time, basically a rather tasteless Shnitzel! I added salt, which i absolutely never do!! It came with a handful of totally dry Rocket leaves with a sprinkle of Parmesan, literally 5 sprinkles! (A misleading mention in the description!).Paying 17 Euros for a dish and then grabbing a Big Mac whilst leaving from across the street!? Not cool! Slapping a famous name on a franchise just isn't enough these days. I wonder what will happen to Jamie's after the novelty wears off!",Jamies Italian
40,The restaurant is really nice with the “classic” Jamie’s decoration. The service is superb; all boys and girls in the service makes you feel like a king. The prices are a little bit to the high side (perhaps as expected by a JI restaurant). The food is very normal; Good but normal; Fullstop,Jamies Italian
30,"I visited this restaurant many times and unfortunately the food is not always the same quality.On sunday night i went there with a friend and had ceasar salad ,pizza and mohitos and all were perfect.On Thursday night we went there to celebrate my daughter's birthday and the food was average or less !I had the prawn linguini ,which is my favourite dish there and it was fully tasteless,not to mention the other pasta with pesto which was an oily disaster!!Besides we asked for the ravioli(second time this week)and they didn't have!Overall it was a disappointing experience!",Jamies Italian
10,We had dinner outside in the back yard and it was a terrible experience.There were a few stray cats that were jumping on our table and chairs constantly.The waitress did nothing about it although he saw what was happening.Basically you couldn't enjoy your dinner.,Jamies Italian
50,At this place due to the prices you csn not visit it every night for dinner BUT the quality of food is 10 stars!!!,Jamies Italian
30,It is an average Italian restaurant. Average Italian food but very good atmosphere. I gave them a second chance but the food eas was still average :/,Jamies Italian
50,"We visited Jamie's for a meal with some good friends. No need to book, and a positive oasis in the searing heat. The staff were smiling and highly attentive, and eager to please. The ordering was swift and our drinks arrived straight away. The lunch special runs from 12-6 and is excellent value at 10.95 for two courses. The meatballs to start were delicious, and the main courses of burgers and 'power salads' were top quality and really flavoursome. A great meal, finished with some unexpected complimentary limoncello liqueurs. We will be back the next time we're in Nicosia.",Jamies Italian
50,"You might consider that I am biased, You would be correct!I had spent ten days in Hospital and my beloved wife was exhausted with caring for me. What better way to celebrate and save her from preparing another meal.The staff are excellent and we felt so welcomed by them. My wife had a Lasanga and I had the chargriled chicken . A great meal and a wonderful ambience. More than we could easily eat.We also went here for my birthday at the end of June and were treated exceptionally well.",Jamies Italian
30,"Well fitted out Restaurant comfortable, nice staff and good service. The food, smoked salmon on a huge slice of bread dripping with a yoghurt sauce was, eat the smoked salmon, leave the rest. The Meat Balls way to salty, The mushrooms pleasant enough.The fillet steak, cooked perfectly and very tasty, The Pork Fillet, boring and not very tasty. The 6 lamb chops on a silly board, with a dip, breadcrumbs, red onion and other things, well lamb tender and medium cooked left it with no juices so I dont quite get this dish. For a restaurant that was quiet the food service was very slow but the waitress was very charming. The wine was very nice . I would not rush back to this place",Jamies Italian
30,It’s been a while since we visited. It was ok at the time. A bit overpriced for the quality of food. The catering was good. I hope it has improved since.,Jamies Italian
50,Enjoyed the summer specials at Jamie’s Italian and they were delicious. His service at the restaurant in Nicosia was excellent. Our group enjoyed the Meatball Carbonara and Gennaro’s Tagliatelle Bolognese. The beef and pork ragu in the bolognese brought back memories of my Italian grandmother’s cooking. This celebrity chef does a great job of bringing that home cooking to the restaurant table. In the future I’ll stop at a Jamie’s Italian restaurant.,Jamies Italian
50,"We go to Cyprus every year and we wanted to try something different. Great menu selection which is changed every six months. The staff were very attentive and interested in us, and the desserts were out of this world! Will definitely go back and will recommend it to friends.",Jamies Italian
40,"Visited mid week with my mother , daughter and granddaughter. The staff were wonderfully attentive ( especially the front of house team) and really went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay and meal . They found us a non smoking table outside , provided a high chair and took our drinks orders . I wanted a cocktail on the menu which wasn't too sweet and they were able to produce a delicious customised drink for me . As I, vegan I was disappointed in the choice but George , who worked there offered to talk to the chef , (William ) and the most delicious vegan pizza I have ever tasted was produced, with oven roasted veg , it really was amazing . I would happily return time and time again with this on the menu . Let's hope George's special vegan pizza becomes a regular addition to the menu!, thanks for a great evening",Jamies Italian
50,"My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times but this one was special, it was my birthday and a special one at that too. We could not have been made more welcome. Free glasses of Prosecco, Free birthday cake afterwards plus a birthday present! We splashed out and both had the most expensive steak on the menu. And whilst waiting we were given their special bread and dip to keep us going, again at no charge! Was the steak worth waiting for, yes, yes, yes, yes! It was fabulous, mine was rare to medium and my beloved's was medium to well done, we requested plain chips and the steaks came with mushrooms and button onions. We had a friend with us who had carbonara and the most amazing salad, which he shared. I had a non-alcoholic cocktail and we had a bottle of water. I left there walking on cloud 9, the staff were superb, they are so very special, just a mention though for Christina who is such a jewel in that restaurant's crown. At the end after the main meals, the bread and the delicious birthday cake we waddled out of there and it still only cost us about 30+ euros each. This is definitely our 'go-to' restaurant when we have the inclination - or should I say when I don't want to cook. Thank you everybody you did us proud.",Jamies Italian
50,"After one year back to Nicosia and straight to Jamies Oliver. The Menue is expended with a Grill section. I have chosen that evening the juicy pork chop. It was above all my expectations juicy, soft just how it has to be.I'm coming back.",Jamies Italian
40,ambience great..had a late lunch here..nachos..great..pizza one of the best in nicosia. Seafood risotto..crap..too salty..flavour all over the place..one of the worst i ever had..cheese cake yum.. service was great..,Jamies Italian
20,"Lovely interior design, but poor food. Service OK. They have tried to revamp the menu with a new grill menu but the quality is not very good. Also, not very cheap for what it offers. Jamie's in the UK is much better value (with purchasing power parity taken into account)",Jamies Italian
30,"There wasn't anything wrong with our dinner, but the food is really not something to remember here. General comment is that the pasta dishes are flavorless. I could not believe we were adding salt to our pasta, just to add a bit of taste. I had ordered the spinach ravioli and my partner had taken the tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms. The pizza was OK. Overall, an unmemorable dinner with very average food.",Jamies Italian
40,"Lovely restaurant in a pleasant area of Nicosia. Qualitatively prepared dishes, very beautiful serve. Comfortable, stylishly delicious. Interesting, delicious children's menu. Pleasant wine. Excellent service. Portions are large enough. Interesting complex side dishes, perfectly prepared fish, sandwiches. Beef is not very tasty.",Jamies Italian
50,"I visited the place with my family for lunch. We ordered pizza, pasta and burger. All were very tasty and of good quality. The service was very good and the staff kind and well informed. Toilets were very clean and modern and the whole ambiance of the restaurant very cosy. I highly recommend it!Extra info: have a taste of the coffee with orange liquor....!!!!!",Jamies Italian
50,My Juicy Pork Chop was very tasty and hardly had any fat. It was served on a bed of purée and chopped parsley and served with Spicy Fries. Very tasty. The Grilled whole Sea Bream was huge and well presented. The Agiorgitiko Mounta was OK but the Zambartas Rosé was excellent. Total cost was €47.00,Jamies Italian
50,I would definitely recommend this restaurant as his food is fantastic. His salads are diet friendly (Ceasar salad is to die for). Restaurant is nice and cosy with a very pleasant atmosphere.,Jamies Italian
50,My wife and I enjoy a meal out where we can have great service a very good food. We usually choose the times when it is not the busiest and we can have a relaxing time and enjoy our food. Here the service is excellent as the staff really do look after us - The atmosphere is encouraging and we always are welcomed very well.,Jamies Italian
20,"I was there in early March 2018 for their lunch special. I ordered the steak which was done medium well as requested and the plate looked beautiful. The seating is very pleasant outside. My big complaint to the staff was the fact that when they offered me sauce to go with my steak they did not indicate that it would cost me extra. The waitress should have informed that it was at additional cost as she offered it rather than try to pass it off as if she was doing me a favor by including it. Furthermore when I contacted Jamie's restaurant online to point this out, they never returned my message. This experience put me off ever going back as I am irritated by their dishonesty, knowing very well I can get great Italian food at Just Italian right across the road.",Jamies Italian
50,Jamie's Italian is one of the best restaurants in Nicosia. The decoration the staff the people everything is just amazing. I love the food i love to hangout with family and friends there because it gives it a special atmosphere. Also the food comes on time and the staff is really polite. The only thing that could change are the prices because you pay more by what you get .,Jamies Italian
30,"Although only my second visit this was disappointing. There were numerous mistakes in the order, reflecting the young and inexperienced staff. The portions were small (maybe UK standard but in Cyprus these are small) and overpriced, in order to cover the franchise fee. Beyond my comprehension why it is so popular with families and mature customers - I can just about see the attraction for young ones; the TGI Fridays kind of customer. Never again.",Jamies Italian
30,Pleasant setting accompanied by good service.Very much liked the pasta and burger dishes.Unfortunately disappointed in couple of occasions with other dishes. Found the description in menu quite intriguing but the dish failed to deliver on tbe expectations. Was reasonably ok but expected more.Will continue to visit but fovus on favorites.,Jamies Italian
30,Was invited here when Jamies first opened and enjoyed our visit. Was the first week of opening so still a few teething problems but to be expected when a new place opens. Revisited a couple of times since. A little dissapointed on one of these visits as still have teething problems. I think a visit from Jamie might do the trick!!,Jamies Italian
30,Venue is really nice and casual. Service was average and so is the food. I ordered a traditional oven cooked steak hoping it would be cooked correctly . Steak was ordered medium and I was served close to well done. Steak was also tough. The ambiance is really nice though,Jamies Italian
20,Nice atmosphere but food is not that great. I was expecting better quality for price.not going again,Jamies Italian
50,"We were there for a family lunch. Whatever we ordered came on time (its maybe one of the fastest restaurants in Nicosia). The food was excellent. Even my 2, 5 loved everything. I would really like to underline the politeness of the staff and their constant interested to make sure everything was fine. Last but not least. Delicious cocktails.",Jamies Italian
10,I was dying to go to this restaurant because i looove jamies recipes but this was disappointing. The pasta was mediocre and the service was a bit slow. The staff however was very friendly and polite! I did not like my choice of pasta and they offered to bring me another dish of my liking and did not charge my pasta that i did not like which is nice. Also the garlic bread was a hard like a rock and not even warm. I hope they upgrade the food quality,Jamies Italian
50,"In love with this place, in love with the people, in love with the recipes, new addition- black Angus fresh ribey straight from Ireland. Take a mushroom sauce side dish to complete the ""fantasy"". A "" must try"" for all you steak lovers out there!",Jamies Italian
30,I visited James a couple of times. The food it decent for James I expected more. The ginger margarita its marvelous. Some friends of mine that go there just love it and some others dont. So its up to you to decide.,Jamies Italian
40,Good selection of food in good presentation and quantity. Prices average to high. Professional fast service. Good decoration upscale place,Jamies Italian
40,Ordered pork chop with ff. The pork was served in a big round plate along with chopped tomatoes and other veggies. It was nice but a bit dry for my standard. The rest of the order (macaroni and cheese for the toddler) and burger were also nice. Overall it was a good experience.,Jamies Italian
40,"Beautiful and warm decoration (except the huge chandellier for which i find no use), excellent and welcoming staff (would prefer it if everyone spoke greek though), tasty food and a good variety (a bit overpriced for a family of 4 with just 2 drinks, €80). WIll only go back on extremely special occasions.",Jamies Italian
30,"Having the privilege to live and study in the UK for almost 6 years, i was daily 'slammed into' the world of the most beloved British chef; Jamie Oliver. Seriously he was in abundance like baked beans. Literally though he was everywhere and he kind of passed his ideology on food to most British i knew. Don't get me wrong on this ok, i often catched my self watching him on youtube for hours. But enough with the intro lets get down to his 'temple' of Italian cuisine. First of all Jamie's Italian as a franchise does really well both in the UK and in Europe. However here in Cyprus it was well adapted in our culture and for me it lacks this Italian finesse; not in the atmosphere, which i rate it 5 out of 5, but in the food. I know as Cypriots we are a demanding sort of people. But hey, this is after-all an ITALIAN restaurant. Get rid of the steaks and burgers and the chicken fillets. Go on with some crazy panzerotti, or calzone, more pizzas or even crack on with some stews (which are not authentic Italian recipes but they can better serve you than a burger); and to be honest if i wanted a burger i wouldn't bother coming to Jamie's Italian. In any case, service is quite moderat but quite smiley hostesses make your way to the huge and awesome dining area and make you feel warm, as it should be. Speaking of budget, dishes are a bit overpriced, especially when it comes to antipasti. Come on its a salad, a tasty salad, but still a salad. Same goes for pasta which is tasty as well, impressed by mezzaluna, but a bit overpriced. Finally i would like to give my best credit to the subtle detail given to children's food which is rather impressive and i respect that.Overall, a moderate dining experience for the name of one of the most infamous chefs worldwide.",Jamies Italian
10,I was as disappointed in Cyprus as in London with the quality of food and service. It was practically cold by the time it got to the table and was a ling wait. The.price is hefty too for the whole experience.,Jamies Italian
40,Good value average quality food. Food used to be better before a few months. Service is fine and overall cleanliness is very good!!,Jamies Italian
40,"I had visited Jamie’s Italian restaurants in London in the past. It was my first time at the Engomi branch. I went there for my name day with my wife. The place is nicely decorated and warm despite its big size. The pasta was tasty, the winelist basic, the entries interesting. The menu should have more variety in my opinion. The staff is young and helpful but needs more experience. Little overpriced for what it offers, but in general a good choice mainly for casual lunch or dinner.",Jamies Italian
40,"The main course is bit overpriced, but the food itself is still tasty. Lunch special might be more valuable.",Jamies Italian
40,"Like Jamie's in the UK same decor same rural feel and some very good and fresh food loved the seafood risotto. As expected with fresh food relatively limited menu choice but something for everyone like wise limited wine list and as with any other Jamie's no deviation from menu even something as simple as a Bloody Mary not possible if it is not on the cocktail list and for example not possible to take one item from the set menu plan and one from a la carte - crazy. Some of the ""souvenirs"" silly prices as well 10 Euros for a few old tea towels ! Also wonder considering Jamie's stance on healthy eating should there be chips and white baps for the ""ultra"" vegeburger"" Still all in all a good eatery - and BTW Jamie has never been there apparently when a celebrity chef gives their name to a restaurant surely they should at least check it out when it opens.",Jamies Italian
40,Jamie’s Italian restaurant is a great restaurant with perfect food and very good service if you have kids they can play at the little playground,Jamies Italian
50,"Me and my boyfriend invite this cozy restaurant one night for a dinner . We choosed the Christmas menu ,and it was just amazing .Nothing bad to say . Really good servis, nice place ,and the food was really tasty . Thank you for nice time",Jamies Italian
50,I Had the Squid starter which was to die for-- I sincerely hope that they make a main course out of it- did have a wee word with the chef about itThat was followed by their delicious pork chop with a wonderfully tasty vegetable sauce. I finished the whole thingThe attention to detail was excellent as was the service that i experienced.A highly recommended eating experience,Jamies Italian
40,"Jamie’s Italian is a wonderful restaurant. The dishes are really nice, especially the deserts. The stuff is very friendly and overall the restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere. I highly recommend it!",Jamies Italian
30,Today 5/12 was my mum's birthday.She made it to 90.So I decided to give her a treat thinking that Jamie's Italian in Nicosia might be a good choice.That was about the dumbest decision I ever made because the evening was a disaster as a result of the staff's incompetence and their inability to offer restitution.But let's start the whole sad story in chronological order.Three days before the event I went personally to the restaurant to pick a table.I was well received by a pleasant girl at reception and was offered the table I requested.I was quite pleased with myself but quite oblivious of the tsunami of blunders that were to occur on what was to be a special evening for mum on her 90th birthday. Cocktails arrived a little late but they were invigorating and tasty.As we were preparing to savour the vegetable antipasti platter we had ordered a young waiter arrived fast and furious bearing the main course of one fillet steak and Gennaro's chicken.We asked about our antipasti only to be told that there was a cock up in the kitchen. He then made the absurd suggestion to bring the antipasti later.We cancelled the veggies and concentrated on the maim course .Mother was struggling with her 30 Euro steak when I realised that a steak knife was not issued. We asked for one and the knife arrived promptly.But our torture was to continue.I soon became aware that the ''funky'' chips I had ordered were not so funky because they looked like roast potatoes.They got that one wrong as well. In a while they brought some soft and oily chips in an odd-looking container. I concluded they were the funky ones .I ate one or two and went back to the roast potatoes thinking that they were the better deal.We desperately tried to save the evening by ordering two glasses of wine.But they were nowhere to be seen.We were half way through our dish and no alcohol in sight to comfort us.The wine finally arrived following our protestations. All of a sudden a young man approached us and tried to offer what appeared to be an apology by waffling and saying nothing substantial.I gave him a piece of my mind but he continued quite undaunted by my negative commentary of the restaurant.I could not but smile in the end and that encouraged him to come up wit this priceless gem. .''Sir when you leave this restaurant i would like you to wear your best smile''. I could not believe my ears and responded with a vengeance.''The only thing that would make me smile would be if you step on top of our table and performed an oriental dance.''What a memorable evening!,Jamies Italian
10,"Oh dear what a shame... we've been here before and the food was lovely but this time I thought yes sea bream as it is beautiful! Sadly the menu has changed. No ravioli, no sea bream so I went for the Amazing Salmon... the only thing amazing was the disappointment! Come on Jamie sort it out as it is .......!",Jamies Italian
30,We had a good dinner - however the selected Antipasti Mushroom something smelled bad - it was supposed to be mushrooms but out of 6 pieces in the basket only was good - the rest smelled fish! The good thing is that the manageress came and asked for feedback. and they do not have Non-Alcoholic beer!! i consider this unacceptable,Jamies Italian
40,"The food was delicious and the staff attentive and friendly. The environment and decoration are beautiful, pleasant, cozy and warm. What was super and excellent though was the Amalfi lemon cheesecake! One of the best desserts I have ever tasted. Smooth meringue on top, silky lemon cream in the middle and soft biscuit mixture at the bottom. A real taste of heaven for lemon flavor lovers!",Jamies Italian
30,"Tasty starters; great presentation..Good wine..Nice atmosphere & decoration..Ordered 2 ""juicy"" pork chop with aubergines. Pork chops ANYTHING BUT JUICY. Aubergines were overloaded with tomato sauce.Dessert : warm brownie with ice cream.. Very nice..",Jamies Italian
40,"Love the way this restaurant is decorated, modern but warm and homely!!We visited in the afternoon with my husband for the lunchtime 3 course meal €13.95.Starters: we had the Spicy meatball Bruschetta lovely sauce but the meatballs fell apart when cutting into them as if they were frozen and stuck in the oven which resulted in them being slightly under done. The Caesar salad which had hazelnuts which was the first time I had these in a salad and it was very tasty!Main: Italian steak & spicy fries (not at all spicy). We paid an extra €4 each for the steak which was disappointingly thin and in places slightly chewy but lovely flavour, also paid an extra €2.50 each for the wild mushroom sauce which was delicious.Dessert: Epic Brownie with a small scoop of vanilla icecream (could have done with a bit more), very tasty but maybe toffee walnuts would have gone better instead of the popcorn!We had water and Coke for our drinks.....and really a 250ml bottle of Coke for €2.90 and a local 1lt bottle of water for €3.20 way over priced.I know this may sound like a negative review but I'd rather be truthful and hope these things are fixed for others.Overall we had a lovely afternoon out and the staff were very friendly!",Jamies Italian
50,"Best pizza in Town!!! Strongly recommend a glass of spritz for start. Friendly staff, great atmosphere:)",Jamies Italian
40,I visited this restaurant a couple of times for lunch with my family.Very cosy place and child friendly.My kids just love to watch the staff prepairing the dishes!The place is big and it tends to get very noisy at lunch time on a weekend.But if u visit the restulaurant for dinner on a weekday(it isnt crowded) you. will enjoy your food and your glass of wine!The food is always fresh and delicious.If u are not a fan of pasta youcan try the burger or the nachos!,Jamies Italian
40,"Lovely place, interesting service and totally ok food. But here is the thing -I love olives and I love to have some of them with my first glass of wine. And of all the places in the world I thought that this would not be a problem at Jamie's. But no! The waiter was really surprised when I asked for some olives. Confused by my request he asked another waiter and also the kitchen, what to do with my outrageous request. So guess what, they could not find me 10 nor 5 nor 3 olives to have with my wine. Really, Jamie? No flexibility at all?But well, otherwise the Jamie's Italian burger was ok, although a little dry, the chocolate cake was really good and the atmosphere lovely.",Jamies Italian
30,"For 10 euro you can get 2-course menu and for 14 a 3-course one.We took the steak (thin slice) the Italian burger, the carbonara, 2 caesar salads and the mushroom fritti with a panna cotta at the end.The steak was acceptable but at such size of thickness, you cannot get a juicy one. Nice freshly made sauce. There is a 4 euro extra if you order this one. 6/10Caesar salad was just lettuce and other greens, few nuts and a piece of bread. Not really the best salad in town. 5/10The mushroom Fritti on the other hand with the breadcrumbs and the onion garlic sauce was a much better choice. Very nicely fried 8/10The carbonara was again nice as you would expect. Fresh and creamy. 6/10The burger was nice, but the actual burger came colder than expected. Probably due to the timing in the kitchen. Three euro on top for that. 6/10Fries were double fried an nicely spiced. A bit heavy on the oil though. 6/10Panna Cotta was with a nice fruits of the forest sauce but not as creamy as i would like it.6/10Service was prompt and courteous. Well trained people, and very polite 9/10The ambience and decoration of the place very nice. 9/10Price was good for such a restaurant, but I would expect a bit better quality of the food. It shows that someone taught the chef to do everything in a specific order and that there was not by impulse.",Jamies Italian
40,"Enjoyed visit to Jamie's, had a variety of food from the 4 of us dining and all were great. Pasta is delicious and highly recommended.",Jamies Italian
20,When you enter the smell of the salami etc which are hanging in open air is very strong and for a vegetarian definitely not appetizing. The is a lot of staff but service is slow. When we ordered coffee the empty plates were left on the table and were only picked up when we asked for the bill. We had pasta which was nice and a salad which wasn’t.,Jamies Italian
50,"I will have to be honest and just say from the beginning that I am not the biggest fan of Jamie's Italian restaurants. I have tried them in the UK and the food was from nothing special to disappointing. In a recent trip to Cyprus I was invited out to dinner by family to this restaurant. My expectations were low with regards to the food.However I have to say I had a very nice experience in Jamie's Italian Nicosia! The food was very good! Added to that, the amazing staff who were polite and friendly and efficient with good sense of humour made our lunch extra special.The overall atmosphere was just really nice.I actually went to this restaurant a second time within the few days I was in Cyprus and I had a similarly good experience!Well done Jamie's Italian Nicosia. I will be visiting again next time I am in Cyprus.",Jamies Italian
50,"It is hard to know where to begin but first I must commend the staff, they are so solicitous without being in your face. The food is gorgeous as are the drinks (including the cocktails!), we have now been several times but last night they pulled out all the stops. One of the wise things they do is not to have an enormous menu. As far as which dishes to recommend that truly is for you to find out as we all have differing taste buds and what I like might not be what you like. But do please visit, the parking is good, the nights are not so hot so your car will not be like an oven when you get back to it and you will feel really special, I promise you. And the manager Adamous is such a courteous gentleman.",Jamies Italian
50,"Tha atmosphere is greatn food tasty, crew professional an prices reasonable. Always feels good to return here!",Jamies Italian
40,Very friendly service and I would recommend the dry-aged sirloin steak... asked for medium rare and actually got medium rare!,Jamies Italian
50,"It's been the 2nd time that I'm visiting this Place and the food was just great.The kids tasted the kids menu and enjoyed it so much.The food is fresh, cooked to perfection. Tons of flavors and clean.If you are in Cyprus – don't miss it out!Prices are very reasonable for a chef restaurant.",Jamies Italian
30,"What a dissapointment...Did try Jamie's out 5 times, twice food was great and so was the service, rest of the times..what a disaster, pasta that was served all stuck together like a fur ball that you could pick up the ball with your fork, the manager advised that it is because it's fresh pasta...$@$??? Sure, best accept that what came out of the kitchen was not up to standards and move on...Generally food that comes out of the kitchen is not consistent, one day you have it and it's Great, another it below standards...It's a shame as it has potential if their is more strict measures on quality that exits the kitchen and the actual restaurant is actually really nice..Hope management pulls their socks up..",Jamies Italian
30,"the place has very nice ambience and the service is good, what am upset about is the economy they make on materials bought which is against the jamie oliver concept, the prices are high and so there should be no economy on the quality of raw materials",Jamies Italian
50,"The restaurant decoration inside and outside is very good. The service was super! (young man working there, outside on Saturday 11/09/17 midday was very good).The food was great! Good quantity, quality and well cooked Mediterranean recipes as you see Jamie on TV :)The price was very good in relation to value you get. I choose the special offers, 3 people food and 4 drinks 37eur.I will definitely go again there when i am in Nicosia!",Jamies Italian
50,Visited a couple of times this top class italian restaurant and I have to admit that pasta dishes are well altende cooked with terrific flavours.Unforgettable dinners with good friends and family.,Jamies Italian
50,"A nice place i usually visit on Sundays, best service ever...these people take service extremely seriously!!! Food is nice overall, prefer the pork chop... sauce is great too...do give it a try!",Jamies Italian
50,"Well, im back after some time to have a lunch at Jamies. Still beautiful restaurant with nice ambience and nice smiley people. Christina, Carolina, Anna, Kalia, Marios & Stavros - opening team positive, strong and happy to assist you. So glad i came - Jamies one of the best places to enjoy amazing lunch or dinner.Xenia keeps the food quality & consistency on very high level.You simply can not go wrong by coming to this gorgeous restaurant!!",Jamies Italian
30,I visited restaurant 3-4 times till now but everytime is getting worse. It has many tasteful dishes but honestly the quantity of the food is getting less and less time to time.,Jamies Italian
50,"My hubby and I went for the 2 course deal. Thoroughly enjoyed the Caesar salad made with fresh greens and radicchio and especially the healthy, tasty yoghurt dressing and toasted hazelnuts.I also thoroughly enjoyed my tagliatelle bolognese beautifully al dente and innovatively topped with pangrattato! Kept stealing from my hubby's gorgeous fries (as he had the burger, which was also yum).The tiramisu was excellent. Really liked the shaved chocolate grated on top and the subtle taste of orange.Will be back to taste the seafood with black squid ink and the lava cake!",Jamies Italian
40,"We were a company of four, as soon as we entered a very kind gentleman greed us and proposed 3-4 tables to us. This was very nice since we had the chance to choose what is most suitable for us. A waiter immediately reached our table and handed a set of menus to each of us; the first was the standard menu and the second was the lunch special offer. Then the lady proposed the dish and the cocktail of the day. Overall I can tell that the service was very good, smiley faces and happy to help. I was glad to see that they still have the same food runner till the day the opened; a tall young gentlemen who is very kind.According to the service there two things I really want to highlight. First is unacceptable to clean the table with a wet cloth and then place cutleries on this wet area. Cutleries must be placed above a napkin for hygiene reasons. Regardless how clean the cloth is, is still a cloth which is used for tables. In addition, when collecting the used plates the waiter asked to hand in our plates since the arrangement of the table didn't allow her to reach. This was not very pleasant since she interrupted our talk to ask us to help with service. Again this is something to do with tables arrangement not the waiter being lazy.Food wise the plates were above average. For starter we had a zucchini bruschetta, a Cesar salad and fried mushrooms. The bruschetta was very nice but i would like it better if there was a tasteful sour cream on it. Cesar salad was perfect, from the beginning the waiter explained that this will be a plain cesar with no chicken so we knew what to expect. Mushrooms were eatable, not very oily, which is good, not not very tasty either. They came with a garlic sauce on the side, this is again a plus since you can avoid garlic if you wish.For mains we had pork chops, a burger and a rib eye steak. All were cooked as we wished. Pork chops were served with vegetables in red sauce and fries, vegetables were mostly carrots and were very oily. The steak was served with salad and fries; all perfect. The burger was served with fried; again all perfect.It worth to mention that our drinks were a bit late, just 10 minutes though. Water was not placed on the table immediately after the order but we waited for it to come along with the rest of the drinks. Water and ""other"" drinks are not supposed to come together. However, I was very happy to see that soft drinks were coming in a glass bottle not in a tinIn addition we were sitting in the corner and the window inner mini bench was dusty enough for the eye to spot.",Jamies Italian
50,The food was something more than delicious!!! Excellent menu and difficult toFind your choice!! Very friendly staff! The environment is beautiful with wood notes! Everything reminds you of Jamie! Recommend 100%!,Jamies Italian
20,I am a Cypriot and have dined with friends and family at the Nicosia restaurant at least 6 times since the opening. Each time the food is worse and the service slower. I LOVE Jamie's Italian and tried it at the Heathrow airport and in Portsmouth. NO comparison! Sorry guys but I don't know what you are doing wrong here. The salad was extremely salty and one with too much vinegar. We ordered a burger which was fine but the fries were chewy and cold. I asked why and they told me that its not possible to cook them at the time of order. They are pre-cooked every morning! The fries?!! We were charged normal price for the burger which was on a summer special offer but the stuff did apologize for the mistake. We did have to chase the waiters for assistance. The sweets menu was not offered. I will not be dining there again.,Jamies Italian
20,"Travelled from Paphos to eat here. Arrived 25mins early for a 3pm booking and was happy to be seated outside with the drinks menu to smoke and wait. No one returned to take our drinks order despite asking for a glass of dry white on arrival. Meatballs were nice, breadcrumbs very salty. We had to seek waiters attention to order food and drinks even though we had put the menus down for a while. Gin and tonic order was forgotten the first time and when the bill came was shocked at the price, I didn't ask for an expensive brand and would have expected a Gordon's when simply ordering a Gin and Tonic, I was surprised to see 8.90 on the bill.Staff were friendly and all smiling, perhaps they just need better training. A desserts menu was not offered.",Jamies Italian
10,I was very disappointed - I cannot eat pepper and when i asked to prepare the meal without it the answer was that they are pre prepared - the burger was fine,Jamies Italian
30,"Jamie's Italian sounds very promising.I've been there last year and the food was good.This time i was disappointed.Although the dishes are big and served in a nice way, it's not tasty.If you're already there, don't skeep the lemon cheese cake.",Jamies Italian
30,"The place was really nice, staff was excellent.About the food, quantity was not very Cypriot-like but i dont mind.I ordered a steak, it was nicely cooked but i think it had way more sauces (pepper, salt etc) than it should.Garlic bread was very tasty",Jamies Italian
40,This is a nice semi-casual place with good food and gluten free options. The ambiance is nice and the service is quite good.,Jamies Italian
50,Very good restaurant polite stuuf .Exellent envioroment and avery good menu for childrent.Try veal taliata and of course pastavery reasonable prices,Jamies Italian
50,"We was there with a couple of vegans and they found good food. Personally me , I enjoyed every piece of my food and wine. I highly recommend it! I love Jamie's Italian",Jamies Italian
40,"Went for an early evening meal with children. Plenty of parking outside if needed. Our kids were given old fashioned view finders to look at pictures of the kids menus and colouring place mats and crayons.The restaurant has good decor and is in keeping with the brand theme.My husband and I started with a cocktail each which were very good.Food was all very tasty and well presented. Yes it was pricey but only because we orders starters, mains, more drinks etc, if we had just had one meal each it wouldn't of been too bad. The meals are more expensive then local tavernas but similar to other chains such as TGI and definitely better food.They brought the children's meals out with our starters so they didn't have to wait.Definitely worth while for a treat.",Jamies Italian
30,"We were invited by friends to meet for dinner, all first time diners at Jamie's.The service was efficient and friendly .The food however was mediocre, an ok meal but don't quite get the ""hype ""!",Jamies Italian
20,I think Jamie could learn a thing or two from Colonel Sanders of KFC - the chicken was absolutely tasteless - it wasn't even high enough quality chicken that I could taste the chicken! It definitely needs 11 herbs and spices.,Jamies Italian
50,"Friday lunch time dinner and had the 2 course special. And was magnificent, staff were friendly, tucker was spot on, definetly would go back but to far away.",Jamies Italian
50,Went for lunch yesterday. Having just ordered our food there was a power cut Rather than panic the staff came and told us all what was happening and offered us drinks & bread whilst it was sorted. Sadly it was a fault out of their control so no hot food was able to be serviced. Only a few cold options were available. We.decided to stay and order a couple of cold dishes. Our lunch was still a very enjoyable afternoon & it did make us mix our food choices up more. When it came time to pay we were told it was on the house with their sincere apologies. You don't get services like that anymore and we were greatly impressed. Well done to all the staff working yesterday over lunchtime ☺,Jamies Italian
30,"excellent location! the food is not very nice- i mean is not very italian, but there is a big catalogue of choices! I ate black pasta with seafood. it was something different. i think its little bit overpriced for the quantity it offers! Nevertheless the location is beutifully decorated!",Jamies Italian
30,Visited twice. Veggie burger was really horrible. Same with carbonara - tasteless lump of pasta . Very disappointing. Nice starters only. I think i would not give it another go. Overpriced place. Surely it has nothing to do with Italian food.,Jamies Italian
50,"I love Jamies Italian,the food is amazing, doesn't matter what you order. There are also some special offers when you go there for lunch.Amazing freshly made pasta, great steaks, amazing desserts etc.The drinks are also great (there are also a lot of different ones without alcohol).The personnel is very friendly and attentive.",Jamies Italian
40,"This time it was a weekday dinner with friends. We had a table outside and we gave our orders. Unfortunately, service was really slow and the restaurant (outside seating area) looked understaffed. I ordered the pumpkin ravioli which looked promising but was too sweet for my taste. The lemon meringue though was divine, thus it wins the four stars!",Jamies Italian
30,"I was pleased with the quality of the food 2 out of the 3 times I visited. On my last visit (on a week day) the burger I ordered was 'average'. The ambience of the place is excellent. Good choice of meat, salads and pasta. I would visit again but I can't say that I am too excited about it :)",Jamies Italian
50,Great experience in Jamie's absulot fair price for set lunch. Great location and excellent service. We can only recommend and will come back during summer.,Jamies Italian
30,"Couple with a three year old. Decor is unique, staff are very friendly,but we consider prices expensive. Cheapest plate is burger for eur13.90. Can go for drinks.",Jamies Italian
30,"Good service, nice decor, but food is nothing special. Nicosia needs a good Italian restaurant but unfortunately this isn't it. I don't think we'll be visiting again.",Jamies Italian
10,"It is just dry, dry, dry. I hoped there will be a sauce or salad, but even a small amount of coleslaw-like salad was dry. The burger itself was like modelling clay. Feta cheese (also hard and dry) overwhelmed other flavours. Even the nice interior design could not comfort me...",Jamies Italian
50,"Despite the mixed reviews, we decided to give Jamie’s Italian a chance and taste first-hand what our friends in London had been raving about for so many years. From the trendy, immaculate atmosphere to the friendly, attentive staff, Jamie’s Italian has cemented itself in our list of favourites! The décor and ambiance is rustically Italian, with a modern twist – don’t expect to find the traditional hues of primary red, green and white; the restaurant has adopted its own unique flair that successfully fast-forwards the establishment to a contemporary, yet authentic eatery.Jamie’s Italian offers a great choice of food and certainly caters according to one’s budget. One has the option of selecting scrumptious meals from the lunchtime special (2 courses for €13.95 or three courses for €15.95), or the more diverse selection of Italian meals available à la carte. The latter proved slightly expensive for Cyprus standards, but it certainly beats the commercialized meals offered at any other renowned chain restaurant. All meals were well-presented, portions were adequate and more importantly, served in a timely manner. Highly recommended is the Black Angus steak, chargrilled with truffle butter, shaved truffle, balsamic onions, drizzled in a creamy wild mushroom sauce. Our flavorsome Italian gastronomical journey was complemented by a soiree of appetizing deserts that leave one wishing to return for more. (Please see photos for additional meals)Jamie’s Italian is suitable for small parties to large groups. Booking is advised for the weekends.",Jamies Italian
30,"We were excited about visiting our first Jamie's Italian restaurant and were really disappointed with the Nicosia offering. The staff are not smiley and friendly they look like they are doing the job of a brain surgeon how serious the faces and character instead of hospitality, which should be friendly. The food was also disappointing, nothing we could not quickly create at home and rather bland. Portions not generous. Staff no idea about Gluten Free even though it's advertised on the menu. We visited at a lunch time where we were one of maybe 4-5 tables maximum so it wasn't busy but we still didn't receive great service and took a long time to finally get our bill. We won't go back sadly.",Jamies Italian
20,"We went a week after this place was open. The quantity of the appetiser was high and they give such little food, for appetizer of 8 euros per person should be something equivalent to a small meal, but not even close.The steak was not better than what i can make at home, again small steakAnd our car got locked in the parking place of the supermarket next door because the parking closes apparently after 8 and the sign is so small and unoticableDrinks are goot and the sweets perfect, this is the only reason this place doesn t get 1 star but 2",Jamies Italian
30,New entry in Nicosia. The food was not as expected to be. Service was ok. Although the place is fantastic!!,Jamies Italian
30,"Very nice and pleasant environment. Several dishes were quite interesting, although some portions were rather small. Prices were average for this type of cuisine. Service was below average, unfortunately. I would visit again to try new dishes, but I didn't go crazy for anything in particular.",Jamies Italian
50,"I really love this place! Great food, great desserts and really helpful and kind stuff. I had a great affogato!! I strongly recommend this place. I am lovin it!!😊👌🌟",Jamies Italian
50,"This was my second visit to Jamie's Italian, the first time I was very disappointed with the food but on writing my review was asked to come back again as their guest, which we did today. My whole experience this time round was exemplary, as before the staff were excellent but this time the food was sublime, we did order the charcuterie board, the rocket and Parmesan salad and the mixed breads, every dish had the most amazing flavours and presented perfectly, to top it all we had a panacatta to share that is my personal favourite and it did not disappoint. Well done Jamie's my faith is restored and I will definitely be coming back.",Jamies Italian
50,"The place is pleasantly cosy and warm. The decoration is stylish and interesting. We started with coctails which had the right alcohol content! I suggest you share with the other parties of your group several of the starter dishes , Highly recommended the spicy calamari and the stuffed porcini mushrooms. I enjoyed the pasta with squid ink and sea food. The lamp chops were mouthwatering but it would be nice if they were accompanied with a bowl of mixed salad or vegetables. The presentation was beautiful but the side dishes looked more decorative than enough to cover for the food. The burgers were brilliant.",Jamies Italian
10,"After long time I have decided to try Jamie's ... worst decision I have ever made in the last 3 years ... If I was in a local taverna and I would have ordered italian, I would not have expected good italian dishes ... but at Jamie's they serve ""italian"" or supposed to be italian ... !!! The food was terribly cooked ...!!! See you never again ... from an italian client ....",Jamies Italian
30,"Very nice atmosphere,nicely decorated. Very good service helpful and polite waiters but food very average! High prices especially for what it has to offer as food quality!",Jamies Italian
20,"We visited Jamie's one time some years ago in England and it was very disappointing. So we wanted to give him another chance in Nicosia. We were a group of six person. We ordered the salmon brusquette (6 euros for one brusquette!) and the smoked salmon & crab salad (7 euros), which by the way was not a salad!! The waitress told us that the crab was not actual crab but sauce, but she didn't tell us that it wasn't a salad but only 3 pieces of smoked salmon!! Anyway...! Then some of us had the baked salmon (16.90), one porcini mushroom pasta, one veggie burger and one jamie's burger. The salmon was of good quality and well cooked but it was absolutely tasteless. It said that it's served with salad and grilled vegetables but it was some greens without sauce and 3 tiny pieces of grilled vegetables! The pasta and burger wasn't something special also. And the veggie burger was tasteless also. In overall, their prices were expensive for what you get and the food wasn't tasty or something special... Also, their menu is misleading, they write so many ingredients, but you get tiny portions or something else...!",Jamies Italian
30,"Extremely popular so book well in advance! Very pleasant setting and very nice, welcoming atmosphere. Excellent service by a wonderful staff. Reasonable prices.HOWEVER, despite the above, this restaurant is severely overrated! The quality of the dishes we ordered (group of five), was definitely below average. The portions too were below average, not filling enough unless you supplement with a starter (generous size of salaads with a wide choice to chose from), and/or a dessert which too was below average in taste. As a result of the crowds, unfortunate mistakes are made in the execution of the orders. On two occasions our order was not submitted to the kitchen and arrived one late after we complained and the mistake was discovered! (To their credit we were treated to desserts). All in all we were disappointed as we expected much, much more from Jamie!",Jamies Italian
30,"Visited specific restaurant previous Saturday for lunch during our visit to Nicosia.Very nice decorated (big) restaurant with bar and open kitchen. Service was really very good, waiter was very polite and ready to answer all our questions about menu with a smile.We made a reservation for as is considered a busy restaurant ever for lunch.Taste wise can not say that I was impressed. Caesar salad with Chicken was very small and without any special taste.Same the spaghetti with meatballs. Meatballs were cooked well but the sauce was without taste. Only above average dish was the salmon with quinoa salad.Taking consideration that decoration, atmosphere and service are for 5 stars but unfo most important matter in a restaurant is the taste of food that is for 3 stars.",Jamies Italian
10,Food was not nice and very expensive. it was not even warm. service was very slow. I would never go to that place again!,Jamies Italian
40,"I am a great fan of Italian food and was especially interested in visiting a chef-branded restaurant. The food was indeed amazing, from the starters, the main course and the dessert. I did feel however that the options on the menu were quite limited.",Jamies Italian
50,"After visiting Jamie's Italian last night, I must admit that this is currently one of the best restaurants in Cyprus. Great ambiance, excellent staff, nice music, delicious dishes!The rib eye steak was nice and juicy, and the lasagne were just divine! For desert, the lemon meringue cheesecake was to die for! All in all, you get value for money, as lovely people serve you the finest ingredients, in an amazing environment! This is my new favourite!",Jamies Italian
40,"Really nice and cozy atmosphere,very tasty food ,really attentive stuff both sides kitchen and service.Not expesive at all.Would visit again!!!!",Jamies Italian
30,The starters was very good and the food was nice but nothing special. Small portions. The dessert was excellent.,Jamies Italian
50,"The food is definitely Italian taste and anyone who doesn't like it most possibly haven't tasted real Italian cuisine before... The athmosphere is a bit strange as is the decor, but overall its a nice place.",Jamies Italian
30,"Ok I had to go 2 times in order to confirm my opinion about this restaurant.The decor is very nice.The service is excellent, the people there really value their job and they are well trained.The food... well it is not bad but... it is not what you would except from an ""Italian"" restaurant and for sure it is expensive.Living in a Mediterranean country, you obviously have higher standards for this kind of food and this one... sorry Jamie... it doesn't make it.I have to admit though that I will go again as the atmosphere is really nice and I want to try some more from its menu.",Jamies Italian
10,"My friend and I went today for lunch, the place looked amazing and the staff very welcoming.... but that is all I can say. The food was terrible, we had the 2 course lunch and both ordered different starters and mains, the brushetta was stale and rubbery, the seafood starter was under seasoned and over cooked with soggy crisps for decoration. I had steak and frites for main, the steak was under seasoned again but OK, the frites were obviously cooked in oil that was not hot enough so were soggy and the red coleslaw was tasteless. I wont even go into the carbonara ! the waiter in fairness offered to swope the fries for roasted heritage baby potatoes which he did, I took one bite and left the rest, again they were rubbery and obviously heated in a microwave. What a let down for such a lovely place. It was definitely style over function, would never go again.",Jamies Italian
30,"We visited Jamie's Italian for an afternoon lunch with family, including two children. The restaurant itself is lovely, nice decor and very roomy. The staff was very welcoming and polite. Unfortunately, the meal itself wasn't as good. Firstly, we ordered two kids meals which we were informed came with drinks. Only one came, and it was the wrong one. Secondly, when our meals came, one kids meal was forgotten so we had to chase it up. By the time it came we had finished eating. The child had to sit there watching and waiting while we ate. Thirdly, the child's meal (salmon in a bag) had 4 thin slivers of salmon, and was definitely not filling. The portions of the meals in general are very small considering the prices. The only saving grace was the attitude of the staff, they are beyond pleasant and accommodating. As far as going again, probably, if only to see if we have a different experience. I will say that they were incredibly busy and so mistakes can be made. But portion sizes, especially for the pasta must be reconsidered. I can buy a packet of pasta for two euros and feed 3 people, not charge 15 euros for a quarter of a plate of spaghetti.",Jamies Italian
40,After my first visit i was very disappointed. I decided to go there again. Defiantly a huge difference from the first time. We had the squid as a starter my son who does not eat fish loved it. Well done keep up the good work,Jamies Italian
40,"I wan't sure what to expect since the reviews were a mixed bag, but a friend and I had a very enjoyable lunch at Jamie's. I've eaten at Jamie's in the UK so I knew what to expect from the menu, so no surprises there. The service was good, very friendly. The atmosphere is what you expect from a chain-style restaurant, shabby-chic-rustic, clean and well organized. We had the three course set menu lunch and it was more than enough food and the price was good. I really had no complaints but I think that some people are expecting something that Jamie's isn't; a Michelin star restaurant where Jamie himself cooks. It's a nice place to eat, on par with The Hard Rock and Friday's, with good food and good service and decent prices. I will definitely go again because it was an over-all pleasant and affordable experience.",Jamies Italian
50,"Excellent atmosphere, friendly staff, unforgettable taste, amazing service! Well done!!! For sure i will visit again!",Jamies Italian
50,Visited Jamie's recently and had a great time!! Was glad to see many healthy options offered and well proportioned portions!! Great atmosphere and friendly staff!! Will definitely be returning!!,Jamies Italian
40,Friendly staff. Cosy atmosphere. Interesting and quite different from the ordinary food choices. And sensible prices. Would definitely go back.,Jamies Italian
20,"What a shame... Food was good, service was confused and slow, atmosphere was none existent. Almost feels like you should feel privileged to be there and that's enough, the restaurant staff don't need to do more! Wouldn't go back.",Jamies Italian
10,"Nothing nice to say about the food. A pasta that I can cook myself!!!! Kids menu... overcooked, small portions, overcooked salmon... no taste...The staff is very sweet and kind!",Jamies Italian
40,"I was quite apprehensive before ordering this dish as I was told it could be a tad spicy. However, the meal was absolutely fine!!! Despite only being able to finish 2 bites, I savoured every succulent piece!!!!! The spices were flowing! Porter was really enjoying this meal! I feel the 2 bites were sufficient enough to warrant a perfectly fine meal, for which deserved a massive 20% tip - and I am more than happy to give a 4 star rating. Porter highly recommends this beautifully spicy dish!!!!(P.S. unfortunately I was off sick the next day due to food poisoning. It was coming out of both ends. Apart from this, the meal was absolutely fine!!!)Chris ""The Porter"" Porter",Jamies Italian
40,Not as expensive as thought. The food was good - very good. The menu was great and the staff were friendly and bilingual. The decor and management is great. Loved sitting outside - thought we were actually in Italy for a while there!,Jamies Italian
50,Jamie's lived up to its reputation once again with superb lasagne and delicious salmon. I love the diversity of their menu and always look forward to trying something different here. A real pleasure to visit this beautiful charming restaurant with friendly and capable staff.Don't leave without trying the famous lemon meringue cheesecake! It's a winner!!Salute!,Jamies Italian
30,"Presentation of food and decoration of place and atmosphere were all super. The food was okay, nothing special really, despite the excellent presentation. But it was very overpriced so I don't think I'll be going again.",Jamies Italian
30,"What I loved: the decor.What desperately needs improving: the service. 40 minutes for a glass of wine to be served is unacceptable.What wasn't so special: the food. While it wasn't poor, it wasn't memorable and definitely didn't stand out. But perhaps my expectations were too high. I love Italian cooking and while I'm certainly no expert, there was nothing I tried that makes me want to go back again. In contrast, Chef Giorgio Locatelli's delicate chicken-filled ravioli served with a cheese fondue and topped with radicchio WILL make me go back to his restaurant again.What was terrible: the desserts. I tried the Tiramisu and gave up after a couple of spoons. It felt like somebody had poured in a sack of sugar. The others at the table had trouble with their desserts too. For a chef that preaches about healthy eating, Jamie's certainly doesn't hold back on the sweet poison.",Jamies Italian
30,"Went there for a lunch , when you walk in was well greeted & the decor was wow , we choose to sit outside as the aircon was to cold for the wife .The wife had carbonara & I had a spag bol both of which was vastly under seasoned, maybe even forgot to season , we needed a good helping of salt, pepper & some extra cheese to get it somewhere near .In fact we was just looking on TripAdvisor for somewhere to go in Nicosia & see Jamies so I think due to the good comments of late we're going to retry again soon , so I'll let you know what our second visit was like , fingers crossed it will be better .",Jamies Italian
50,Jamie's Italian is a very friendly place to go! The food is very- very delicious and tasty. The people are very kind and polite. There's an indoor and an outdoor place. I recommend it to all the people that like Jamie's Oliver food and I think everybody should visit it because it is awesome!!!,Jamies Italian
50,"I have visit this beautiful restaurant several times.... where to start - first of all food quality and presentation has Jamies signature all over it. It is a place in Nicosia where you can enjoy carefuly sourced first quality food items!!! Something what is not easily found here. You can enjoy three course meal whitin 25eur Portions are adequate - i had problem to finish my dessert!!The restaurant is one if the most beautiful ones ive visited here in Cyprus. The ambience is vibrant and very positive.And the service!!! Very polite, smiling and always ready to assist you...Really u feel welcome here anytime you come.KUDOS to the whole team!!Thank youI highly recomend ...",Jamies Italian
50,"Appetizer, main dish and deserts were all incredibly perfect with high quality and wonderfull presentation.I had the best garlic bread ever and the lamb chops were delicious .Besides the menu and atmosphere, the service was 1st class. The staff are attentive and professional providing amazing hospitality , very friendly and always smiling which made the experience even better.In summary it's not an everyday restaurant.For all the food lovers its a must visit !",Jamies Italian
10,"Although the food is OK and the service is good, the fact that the ""outside"" area, which is also a smokers area, is not actually outside but 100% sealed all around as well as from above makes this an absolutely disgusting place, not to mention illegal.No need to go into details about our visit (we were there with small children), I will just say this was a horrible experience and I really do regret accepting the bill and not bringing this up to the manager at the time.Unacceptable!",Jamies Italian
30,"Visited recently for lunch, and was somewhat disappointed. The service was overeager, and the food portions were a tad on the low side, while the flavors were subdued. Expected much more from this franchise and the buzz / advertisements it has generated. The prices are definitely more than what you pay for.",Jamies Italian
50,"I recommend it 1000%!! I tried the ravioli with pumpkin, aaaaamazing!! Friendly staff and the interior breathtaking! Good place for special events (birthday, hens night etc) specious... furthermore you can buy Jamies products!! A bit pricy but worth it!",Jamies Italian
50,Thankyou for an excellent meal fab service on Xmas eve Thomas you were a star! We shopped in Nicosia not so easy with one way system so went to Jamie's in engomi first rate food great atmosphere and not expensive open in paphos pleeeese!,Jamies Italian
40,"Jamies at its best.Hight quality food, fantastic pasta and cocktails ! Recommended for a casual night out !",Jamies Italian
20,"Visited Jamie's last night for our Departmental Christmas meal. The staff was very attentive, however the big disappointment was the food. The prawn pasta was spongy, the chicken milanese was a very thin piece of chicken fried , the chips were soggy and the salmon was blunt. I would definitely not go back there and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",Jamies Italian
30,"Found a big piece of plastic in my food. It was in a white spread so I didn't see it and bit on it! The staff were very apologetic and didn't charge me for my meal. I took my daughter and her friends to Jamie's as I love the kids menu which were of a very high standard! The kids' meals came with a ""shake me"" salad and a fresh juice. Service was excellent and the premises clean and cosy. All in all a good experience (despite the initial disappointment).",Jamies Italian
50,"The best restaurant in the Island, perfect reception, prefect staff, and perfect food!I have been in many place all around the world, but nothing compares to the food, the service of this restaurant.The prices are fair, and the restaurant is lovely inside and out.",Jamies Italian
50,"I've been there quite a few times, the quality of the food and the service were always excellent!! Pricy but definitely worth its money. Simple rustic dishes with quality ingredients.",Jamies Italian
50,midweek special menu is fantastic.truffle tagliatelle/italian steak/amalfi lemon meringue cheesecake.wow!!! and all for 15.95 euros.really enjoyable and with staff that are happy that you are there. a great experience alround.we will be returning shortly to try the rest of the menu,Jamies Italian
20,"The place is very impressive, and from that point of view, is well worth a visit. However, the food was a real disappointment. Although the menu includes some pretentious names of dishes, most of the dishes that we ordered were indifferent (at best...). Price-wise, you definitely pay more than you get. Service was good and prompt. The restaurant is surviving (at the moment) based on the strong brand name of Jamie Oliver.",Jamies Italian
30,"For all the hype of Jamie Oliver, this restaurant did not live up to expectations. The service was inadequate for a chain restaurant that prides itself on its brand: food either was delivered out of sequence or excessively late. Unfortunately, this place suffers from what most foreign-owned establishments do: overpriced offerings in a beautiful atmosphere that do not justify sub-standard food and service. For a couple to enjoy a proper night out with a cocktail, two shared appetizers and a first course, two main dishes and dessert along with coffee, you can expect to pay €80. It would be worth it if the portions were bigger and the service were improved. Otherwise, there are finer offerings where you can get more value for the same price.",Jamies Italian
40,"Been there a couple of times since our first visit during the first week it opened.The menu keeps changing and there are more and more interesting things to try depending on the season. That said, it is clear that Jamie’s are using the best and freshest supplies around.We choose to sit at the bar and enjoy our dinner along with a couple of cocktails. The only problem is that all the glass-washing and water-bottle gathering is happening there, which is quite a big nuisance to have while sitting at such a great bar. This must definitely change if Jamie’s wants to take advantage of the bar and serve people who like to sit there.Food is always great. Be careful to read the full dish description because there might be things in the plate you didn’t notice, that will change what you expected.Prices are fine, based on the size of the dishes. We also love the option to get the half-portion on the pasta dishes.Definitely recommended for families and once the bar is a bit quieter I will consider recommending it for late dinner and drinks.",Jamies Italian
50,"Visited the restaurant with family. It is great that there is kids menu, even my two fussy eaters could find something tasty to eat. The food was very tasty. The place and service has great European service standards, stuff was very pleasant and helpful. The service standards are exceptional for Cyprus (missed it so much!). Really enjoyed the visit and will come back again.",Jamies Italian
20,We were 5 people. We ordered an antipasti dish for 5 with cheeses and cold cuts. Then each ordered a pasta dish. We all shared a red wine (the cheapest on the wine menu) and at the end 3 sweets shared by 5 people. Everyone in the company complained that the portions were very small. We left the place and I have to admit that we were all still hungry!! The cherry on the cake was the bill.... we were all freaked out!! We paid 30euros each!!!!!!! I think that the administration of this restaurant should consider that this is Cyprus!! Cypriots love good food and big portions in reasonable prices! My opinion is that if you are hungry there are much more better choices of restaurants in Nicosia and not so expensive!,Jamies Italian
50,"This is a place/restaurant for those who know how to appreciate quality over price. Yes, it is slightly pricy (about EUR3-4/p.p) compared to other options. Does it worth it? OH YES IT DOES!!! Once you try the food and experience the service and the whole atmosphere, then you won't regret the extra you paid and you'll definitely return....soon!!! There's no need to get into the details of the food really. To keep it short everything is a level higher than anything else I've experienced so far, not only in town but in the whole island! I dare to say that this will become our town's favourite place!",Jamies Italian
50,Visited the restaurant for lunch. The special mid week lunch menu was great value - 2 courses for €13.95,Jamies Italian
20,"We visited the restaurant yesterday with some friends. The restaurant was very well decorated. And here all the strange things started to happen. The waitress took the wrong order (stake instead of burger) probably because she speaks a strange version of Greek and English that nobody could understand. The pasta and meat balls that we order from the kids menu were cold, tasteless and sticky equal of hospital food. When the waiter changed the knifes and forks they put them on the table and not on a towel or in the plate (hygiene is an unknown word there). Though the ravioli were excellent and the steak just good the other plates were tasteless and just average. The bill instead was too expensive and the value for money ratio was just a joke for today΄s trip. Would not recommend , would not go again. Sorry Jamie i think you deserve better.",Jamies Italian
50,"We chose to make our first visit on a birthday occasion. Design and decor wonderful inside, the staff very warm very friendly and quick in their actions. As for the food - although the size of the portions were not as large as the plates the taste was excellent. The only feedback on my part is that i don't eat meat and the menu had two or three mains for non meat eaters. Heads up to the girl staff who were very helpful over the phone and for the chef who made my wonderful pumpkin ravioli. Definitely returning there again soon...",Jamies Italian
50,So i almost don't come cause i was reading all these reviews about the reastaurand and i wasn't happy. Thank god i didn't listen. Its the best place for Italian in nicosia. The atmosphere of the place is amazing. The best staff i ever saw. Friendly smiling trying to please you all the time. I left the food for last. What can i say. Big portions tasty and colourful. I can't wait to come back and try something else. I love every minute of it. Thank you,Jamies Italian
50,Go see and try yourself. Quality and presentation of food plus beautiful restaurant combined with great service is guaranteed recipe for amazing experience.Highly recommended.,Jamies Italian
50,Loved this restaurant. The decor is stunning and unique...something you don't really find in Cyprus. The food was delicious and highly recommend the tomato ricotta bruschetta as a starter and the prawn linguine as a main. The service was great. All the staff was very attentive and polite.,Jamies Italian
30,I had lunch there with some collegues. I had the lunch menu. Was so so. It did not taste any special to me. I had the truffle tagliatelle starter and the superfood lunch with avocardo. To be honest was a bit disappointed.,Jamies Italian
50,"Visited the place for a first time and loved it straight away! The drinks were nice and the food that we tried was amazing. You should try the garlic bread from the starter and the homemade pastas are great as well. Mine was prawns linguini and were tasteful. Add to all this the very good and friendly service, the the cozy atmosphere and the beautiful decoration and you have one of the best restaurants in town. Defined will go again!!",Jamies Italian
40,"We went there yesterday and it was very nice but not as good as we expected! The servise was exellent and the pasta was good,but the bread was not very fresh and the salad not very tasty!! Overall a good experience!",Jamies Italian
50,"Amazing restaurant with a lovely and very positive decor. Excellent food! Amazing tastes! Extremely helpful, friendly and very professional staff!",Jamies Italian
50,"Went there for a dinner with my husband. We ordered prawn lingunie, the amazing seabream and rib eye and the divine garlic bread. Everything was amazing and service was perfect. Totally recomended. The garden was amazing.",Jamies Italian
40,"Jamie's is a ""chain"" restaurant, but a higher-end one. This is not a Bennigans or TGIFriday's, it's a good several steps above those. The menu is heavily italian, but not only. In addition to their many pastas, they also have several meat dishes, interesting starters and side dishes, and even daily specials.Unless you're going with children, I would avoid Sundays. It can be very loud and the tables in certain sections begin to get cramped together to accomodate large parties. But this is not the case during the week when it's a more professional group, or later in the evening.The restaurant also has a nice patio where one can eat or just have cocktails and appetizers.So this isn't a quaint taverna tucked away in a corner of the old town, and it's an admittedly commercial decor, but when I get tired of the usual fare, Jamie's satisifies my need for a more diverse, international menu with plenty of taste sensations available -- in several visits I've never been disappointed.",Jamies Italian
30,"Too much reputation too much advertising but did not meet my expectations. Nice service, nice place, two of the five dishes we tried were average, two were very good and one was not edible. You can eat better and cheaper in Nicosia but overall not a bad experience.",Jamies Italian
40,"The place is nice, service is great and the food is amazing!!!A unique Italian experience that delights one's senses, with every bite as the tastes fuse into one's mouth as the feeling of melting with pleasure takes over and stays until the very last bite.",Jamies Italian
40,We been with my friends for a henz party.The enviroment was really nice. Staff was polite and helpful. We taste lots of plates. Food was nice. Manager of restaurant offered to us free bottle of wine as we celebrated pre-wedding party. Really kind of them.,Jamies Italian
50,great food loved every bite we had we ordered 6 different dishes all were excellent so were the 4 desserts a must restaurant,Jamies Italian
40,A change from traditional Cyprus meze. Food is awesome Staff attentive Great food and reasonable priced,Jamies Italian
30,"Well, yeah, Jimmy Oliver is a good guy, but this restaurant is not something extraordinary. We had dinner for two. I have a lactose intolerance, yet I'm mad about pasta. I have tried to treat myself to pasta, but that was a damn good fail. They brought me cold pasta. It was a big problem to order it, because restaurant is not ready to deal with problematic customers. My companion said that her pasta was not 5 star, but average.",Jamies Italian
50,"The restaurant deserves nothing but enthusiastic responses. Nice atmosphere, helpful and friendly staff. Each piece that you eat is filled with love. The chefs master their craft. Happy Chicken lollipops are fantastic. Tomato bruschetta melts in your mouth. Still dream of Ultimate garlic bread",Jamies Italian
40,"Been here twice, love the romantic atmosphere and the friendly but professional service. Tasty food. Not many vegetarian options though!",Jamies Italian
30,The place is well decorated and the atmosphere is nice. The staff is friendly and the serving in general is good. Prices are ok. The quality of dishes varies. My dish was squid pasta. It was very salty and the seafood in the pasta was disastrous. Traces of poor quality seafood inside the pasta smelling plastic. Unacceptable.my evening was completely destroyed. They have to rethink their attitude to customers in terms of food quality.,Jamies Italian
50,Went with my boyfriend and we had great time together. We enjoyed our pasta - shrimp pasta and carbonara!! Service was very friendly and welcoming...,Jamies Italian
50,"I went with my friend, because we heard a lot about Jamie's in Nicosia. Well the restaurant is amazing - loved the decor. The food i enjoyed very much - garlic bread to die for and the staff smiling and welcoming!!",Jamies Italian
50,"Super happy i came and tried!!Food presentation as from his shows!! Positive and friendly service. Beautiful place, definitely recomend it!!",Jamies Italian
10,"Very friendly staff, but they were not very organised and did not bring on time food and beverages.Veryyyyyyyyy low quality of food and also very small quantity.I would recommend it as the last choice of yours.",Jamies Italian
50,"Hands down one of our favourite places to eat in Nicosia. Great and quality food, easy to book, great wine selection and fantastic staff. Special mention to Thomas who made both times we visited memorable.Pasta is fantastic!!!! Two big thumbs up.",Jamies Italian
50,"diffrent reviews here about ghis restaurant. however im trully happy i came and experiends myself. lovely atending happg to help service as well as amazing food (prawn linguini & superfood salad). go, see and experience yourself. looved it at jamies.",Jamies Italian
50,"Ive been to Jamies during my vacation in Cyprus!! Service, food quality anf presentation was outstanding!!!! the plates we gotnon our able looked like one from Jamies show on tv..definitely recomend it.",Jamies Italian
20,"Very nice enviroment and pretty friendly and attentive staff. However, the food was really bad. We had a tomato bruscetta as starters and they were ok. The Italian beef was the worst dish ever. A horribly leathery peace of meet with a dry and tasteless coleslaw and strange tasting fries. The rib eye steak was served without anything else but fries, tasteless and boring. The pasta of the day was hard and dry, obviously prepared much earlier and with no taste of garlic or chili as advertized. How can Jamie Oliver give his name to food as bad as this?",Jamies Italian
30,"Nice interior design and inexperienced serving personnel that try to offer good service. Food was OK but nothing special. The rib eye was chewy, not particularly tender and without much flavor. Had to ask twice for some of our drinks.",Jamies Italian
40,"Jamie's Italian was overall wonderful. Loved the setting, the great and attentive service, and the food was pretty awesome. A bit pricey, yes. This is not somewhere I would go on the regular, but for a birthday or a similar occasion.The Italian Nachos we ordered as an app were ok, nothing special. We would probably skip the starters next time as they aren't huge in quantity, perhaps just some garlic bread which we liked. The papardelle with meatballs was so so good though. Totally recommend it. The desserts we very nice as well. Will visit again!",Jamies Italian
40,"I really liked the ambience and decor of the inside of the restaurant. It was a surprise to me that the menu was so basic - i was expecting to have a bigger selection and variety and more specialty dishes of Jamies :-) pls do consider more options.However the dish i tried - the sauce was superb but was laid down a bit with the meat not quite to my liking. The pasta was much much better, tried by my friend and was really delitious! Desert was impeccable!The service was very good and i would love to go again and try something else.",Jamies Italian
50,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this lovely restaurant... We visited it one Sunday lunchtime with my family after hearing different reviews. I was very impressed by the fantastic decor and surroundings which we found very original for cyprus. Also, the staff were extremely kind and friendly as well as efficient and gave a lot of attention to our 3 children. The starters as well as the main dishes were lovely and very tasty and the desserts were fantastic... Will definitely be visiting again!",Jamies Italian
20,"The restaurant received a lot of hype when it opened however in my opinion it has failed to deliver.My wife and I went for dinner on a friday evening, and we got seated at a wooden table in the middle of the restaurant. While the decor and interior design is appealing, unfortunately the restaurant attracts ""TGIF type of people"". We were seated next to 2 teenagers who were in their shorts and trainers. And further down were 4 families with young children all screaming and running about. While we have nothing against that, thats not what you expect from a restaurant which charges 54 euros for a plate of pasta, a chicken dish and drinks.In addition, its menu is uninspiring (pasta and classic meat dishes like burgers, chicken, salmon) and its service is bad and slow.In my opinion, the restaurant has to decide what it wants to be. An upscale restaurant, with interesting menu and good service; or one aimed at families, serving burgers and chips, and waiters singing happy birthday songs to kids.",Jamies Italian
30,"We went for a date night dinner to Jamie's Italian hoping for something a bit nicer than the usual meze offerings at Cyprus restaurants. While the interior design was lovely and the food was fine, the overall experience was disappointing.The initial vibe of the restaurant was more TGI Fridays than sophisticated and classy. There were many large families with loud and disruptive children, their squeals echoing around the hard floors and artisan interior design.Our experience was not helped by the fact we were located on a small table in the middle of the walkway of the restaurant next to the bar. This meant that we had a constant stream of people walking by us and putting their butts in our faces and dinners (including the staff). There were other tables in more quiet and relaxed positions but alas we were not so fortunate to get seated there.I did really love their artisan bread box and glad to see the excellent local Zambartas wines on the menu. Our mains were perfectly fine but certainly nothing to rave about. The service was average too, serving our dinner within about 2 minutes of ordering it so our whole dinner experience finished in about 1 hour.When our mains were served we were keen to get drinks to accompany them. By the time we managed to get the attention of our waiter, order drinks and have them delivered we had finished our dinner. They then asked us for coffee. Not sure I know of anyone who enjoys their coffee with a cold glass of white wine.Keeping in mind this is a local restaurant for us, would we go back?! Probably not unless we were invited there by someone else who had already chosen the venue. Would we recommend it to others? Not really, unless you've got a bunch of loud kids yourself.",Jamies Italian
50,"Yesterday I had a lovely dinner at Jamie's Italian restaurant! The atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant is something you do not find regularly especially in Cyprus. The service was amazing with the waitress attending fast to our needs. The food was exceptional, fresh and of high quality!Highly recommended to anyone! Definitely going back!",Jamies Italian
20,"I wasn't keen on going due the fact that I am not a big fan of the franchise restaurant model, however my wife wanted to go so I gave in and we went with our 2 kids. Initial impressions weren't good as our waiter went MIA and we had to wave someone over to order our salad. We ordered wine and a salad and I must say the broccoli/beetroot and bean salad was very good, perfect seasoning and fresh ingredients. This unfortunately was to be the only positive of our evening. Again we had to flag down a waiter which took several attempts..we ordered 3 different pastas and a burger. The pasta dishes arrived, which I have to say were very small dishes for what you pay ( €12-€16). And to my horror/disappointment the pasta was lukewarm outside and when I went to mix the pasta I was hit by extreme volcano heat from the middle of the dish!! Yes microwaved!! How on earth can you claim to be an Italian restaurant when you are reheating pasta dishes, possibly one of the easiest meals to cook? The kids pasta was the same. My wife's burger looked impressive but tasteless and tough.Nobody checked on us to see if our meals were OK, add to this the continuous searching for a member of staff to order drinks and you are looking at a disgruntled customer who just spent €100. While I am smart enough to know that this is a business venture that Jamie Oliver has added his name to (and he probably earns a handsome royalty) it is a million miles from his early days at Carluccios.",Jamies Italian
30,"We visited this restaurant with so much enthusiasm and full of high expectations on the food taste and presentation but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. As for the prices, it was very expensive. It is nothing like Jamie Oliver's TV show that everything seems so tasty and fine. Very average, probably won't go again.",Jamies Italian
30,"We visited with much expectation..as we entered our expectations were even higher as the place is awesome,excellent decor,friendly staff. But we were highly disappointed with food which was below average..my husband had parpadele with meatballs,in terms of taste was ok but pasta was uncooked!(aldente does not mean uncooked people!), i ordered the italian steak which was TERRIBLE,tasteless (i even used my son's ketchup to add some flavour!). Only the lemon cheesecake that we had as a dessert was above average. Prices are ok as far as there will be food quality improvement!",Jamies Italian
40,This restaurant has a very special decoration. Excellent service and friendly staff. We ordered two salads as a main course but portions were small.,Jamies Italian
30,"Had lunch the two of us. I forgot to review this restaurant when I visited back in July. If you remove the pleasant interior surroundings, and a relatively good service which reflects on the owner, the food I must say was nothing extraordinary. It does have what it takes as an establishment, but, is yet to deliver the expected quality. We expect more from Jamie.",Jamies Italian
50,"Hidden behind Nero Cafe, Engomi, one of the best Italian restaurants in Nicosia. Don't think of pasta only, noway! Exceprional service and very well trained staff, never seen staff so polite and smily in Cyprus restaurants!",Jamies Italian
20,"This place is overrated. We talk about tasteless food here. We ordered two starters (shrimps and mushrooms over italian thin pita bread) and two mains (risotto with broccoli and arabiata, which wasn't in the menu but they said they could make it). Very very average food and tasteless. No flavors, no marinatings, no seasonings. Plus, they don't make pizza. But this is only a side comment, I wouldn't mind if everything else was good.",Jamies Italian
50,"Wow what a little surprise was in Nicosia for something else and decided to give the place a go from stepping inside service great,surroundings great,very Jamie Oliver attention to detail great and the food was just perfect very happy chili prawns very tasty my partners prawn linguine delicious and my steak cooked perfect well done chefs will be recommending to all and now Nicosia has become a little more inviting by this restaurant.",Jamies Italian
10,The starters were uninteresting with only the super food salad being the highlight. The crab bruschetta could have passed for canned crab over bread and the garlic and chilli prawns were average. 3 of us had the baked salmon for main which they were happy with. The pasta dishes were uninteresting with no real flavour and the kids burger was dry. The service needs serious improvement with waiters having a cafe type attitude. Not what I expected from a famous chef's restaurant. With medium sized pasta dishes priced at 15 euro each the experience should be memorable.,Jamies Italian
30,"Visited the restaurant with a little bit of a draw back as we had visited Jamie's Italian in the UK and was very disappointed, however we said we would give this one another try but once again was deeply disappointed!We had for starters the crab arancini (average), the crab and avocado bruschetta (average), the baked chestnut mushrooms (oily and tasteless), we had asked for the baked king scallops but the waiter said they were unavaiable, the super food salad (nothing special); for main course we had the Rib-Eye Steak, medium cooked (very disappointing!!!! tasteless) and for dessert we had the Almond Tart (the only dish which I enjoyed)!!!!The ambiance is great and the waiters are well trained however the food was disappointing - tasteless - I LOVE JAMIE and have 4 of his books and love to watch him cook however he needs to visit his restaurants and try and fix the mistakes as they are not up to his standards of cooking!!!! :(Pleaseeeeeeee Jamieeeeeeeee",Jamies Italian
50,"Well what can I say this Resturant was fantastic compared to the one in London the nachos where great the burger was perfectly cooked the pasta was tasty the pork chop was juicy ,there wine selection was great the staff was on the ball the RESTURANT was clean there desserts where heavenly I would definitely come back !",Jamies Italian
20,"We were invited for lunch by a couple of friends in May 2016. The overall experience was below average:- Very very very average food (I had the pumpkin ravioli which was just plain). Out of 15-16 main dishes we ordered only 1 was ok (spaghetti bolognese)- Going to an ""Italian"" place you would expect to find pizzas and not burgers... Which had more breadcrumbs than meat- Fries were extremely deep fried and even their colour was dark brown (which made me wonder how often is the oil being changed)- Overpriced! Felt sorry for the couple paying!On the plus side:- great ambiance and vibe for a casual bite- the lemon cheesecakeI'm really having difficulties in being convinced to return",Jamies Italian
40,"In general a very good new italian restaurant in town. Well decorated, friendly staff and in a good place. On the other side ,the dishes were overall overpriced and some of the were also not including the sides..that needs improvement",Jamies Italian
40,"My significan other and I visited this restaurant taking the opportunity as Nicosia was ""empty"" due to summer season and it would guarantee a good serviceFirst of all let me say that the place is absolutely beautiful and our waitress was the friendliest and most accomodating young lady we have ever met. So in terms of a location and service is a 10/10.Now where food is concerned it does have a room for improvement. We ordered 2 starters; Garlic Bread and Fried Polenta chips. The garlic bread was so tasty and filling that it send me to cloud 9. The polenta chips were crispy but blunt I am afraid. I believe that if the chef had chosen to add a type of goat cheese it would have done wonders.Now the main was also an extreme. My partner's chiken with egg was so good I just wanted to switch plates with him. It was so velvety and tasty to the palate. My crab spaghetti on the other half was tasteless. I kept adding salt just to get some taste.Overall the dishes are a bit pricey, ranging from €15 up but if they are in top quality then no one will complain.I also need to give a major kudos to the restaurant giving an option of a small portion version of all mains as I have a small apettite.",Jamies Italian
20,"The food was tasteless. 3 appetisers ordered, garlic mushrooms were absolutely blunt. Only the super food salad was imaginative and worth it. I had a steak, the quality of it was sub-par to say the least. It has a great atmosphere, such a beautiful place ; petty i'm not going back because of the food.",Jamies Italian
50,We have been in the restaurant a number of times and the food is of high quality with fresh ingredients. Portions are of reasonable quantity and the service is very good.Highly recommended,Jamies Italian
40,"I went there with my wife and two sons. The dishes were all carefully prepared. I could not help thinking however that the food was not that extraordinary for the price. I guess this food in London may be somewhat exotic but in Cyprus it looks more ordinary. The size of the portions is such that one has to order both a starter and a main dish if one is hungry. Do not expect to pay less than 25-30 euros per person and be at all satisfied. I would definitely want to visit again for a family meal, except that the price would make me think twice.",Jamies Italian
50,"Really good food, unique dishes, nice atmosphere and excellent service! Try the chicken milanese, probably with a side dish if you are really hungry(i didn't need one) and the pasta dish with the meatballs. We also liked the crab aracini as a starter and loved the cheesecake at the end.",Jamies Italian
50,"Visited the restaurant for a lunch and first if all I was amazed with the place. It looks very nice and it made me sit inside so I can observe it more. After looking the place I had a look on the menu, in which I had plenty of options and i tried the cold cuts platter,  was very nice but the presentation was over the top,  and then I continued with the meatballs papardele and i loved them, the pasta is homemade so the sauce and you have a nice feeling that you eat at home. Finally the service was very good,  fast and efficient, and they gave me a nice time. Overall it's a very good restaurant and i will visit it again!",Jamies Italian
50,"I have been there a few times and had always enjoyed it.There is a variety of tasty starters and excellent main dishes as well to chose from.As a starter, I suggest the Cured Meats Plank, as well as the baked Chestnut Mushrooms. The main dishes are carefully cooked and the outcome is astonishing! You can choose from pasta, salads, burger, steaks, samon, chicken and others. There is also a wide variety of wines and cocktails. The desserts are very tasty as well (cheesecake for instance).",Jamies Italian
50,"Came here as a family of 8 people while here on holiday, all first time visiting a Jamie Oliver restaurant.First impressions were very very good, clean, airy and lovely decor and staff very polite.Food was gorgeous, Italian steak was very tasty, full of flavour and funky chips.Kids had Jamie's lunch box which included wrap, carrot ribbons, shake me salad, fruit and drink. Kids loved it!!Over all great experience, food was delicious, and didn't wait long, staff always attentive to our needs. Definatly a restaurant to visit!!!",Jamies Italian
50,Great Italian food and amazing cocktails. Very good service and nice atmosphere. Good for casual gatherings with friends,Jamies Italian
50,"I visited this restaurant for lunch.I enjoyed the food very much.Although i had heard different opinions ,we all liked our plates.We had pumpkin ravioli ,grill salmon and rigatoni pomotoro.All were very delicious at reasonable prices.Excellent service.The place very nice decorated.I will definately recommend it and will go there again!",Jamies Italian
40,"Firstly, I believe that people have the wrong impression on what they should expect when they visit the restaurant. Jamie Oliver is a great chef, and an even better TV personality, so I was expecting good food, but did not have unrealistic expectations like some other people I know who visited and expected 'more'.The starters were great tasting, small portions, but still good. We had crispy calamari and the worlds greatest olives.. we live in Cyprus... the title, 'worlds greatest olives' are for a nation where olives are not part of their everyday lives, history or culture. But again, they tasted good.For mains I had the squid ink pasta - it was absolutely delicious and the portion size was perfect. That being said, I could not finish it...We also had desserts, didnt try any because i was stuffed, but they smelled and looked amazing.Would recommend to go.. its better having your own opinion about a place rather than listen to the opinions of others.I would go again.",Jamies Italian
50,Been twice - each time the food was gorgeous. we cant manage more than a starter and a main - so value!!! Third visit we are going for salads and a total calorific pudding !,Jamies Italian
40,I love this restaurant for many reasons.Excellent service and very friendly staff.I love the food very tasty and i live the jamie concept. Always happy to eat here.,Jamies Italian
50,"This was our second visit to Jamie Oliver's, and the presentation and quality of food is sublime. I had the aubergine with pomegranate and yoghurt, which was to die for, and my husband had the pork chop, which he loved.If I could just make one small point is that the menu for desserts came as soon as they cleared our main courses, which made us feel a little rushed.Then another waitress came to ask if we wanted to order desserts one minutelater, other than that, lovely welcoming staff and perfect food.",Jamies Italian
40,"Atmosphere is fantastic both inside and garden, stylish decoration, stuff is friendly and helpful, food could be better, not excellent but very good except that was very salty. Prices not the best, about 16-17 euros each plate. We may go another time....",Jamies Italian
40,"Appetisers: The ravioli and crispy squid were really niceMain ones: The pork chop was amazing, the prawns pasta was very good with plenty of prawns and the burger was dissapointing. I was so excited to try that burger especially after watching Jamie on FoodTube preparing the sauce recipe and then enjoying the Jamies Italian burger with that italian guy... looked so juicy and tasteful. Now the burger I tried was blunt, with no sauce, overcooked and dry as a bone... the only tasty thing was that special salami inside.Deserts: Tiramisu was really nice and lava cake was nice but expected it a bit warmer to match with the ice cream.Service: The guy serving us fetched me the 1st bottle of beer really fast and I was very pleased, but the 2nd one took him 20 mins and got me frustrated asking other waiters for the beer since I could not find the guy(there is only bottled beer so you cant get a pint). Other than that service was good.Price: The prices were much better than I expected since everybody was telling I was about to pay 40 per person etc.. It is cheaper than Fridays with a better quality. We paid 83 euro for 3 adults which is ok.",Jamies Italian
40,"Excellent food, excellent deco, excellent service but very expensive! We paid 70 euros for 3 people without entrees or desserts! Jamie's Italian in the UK is cheaper! Too bad! People want to return but the prices are forbidding!",Jamies Italian
40,"We really enjoyed our dinner at Jamie's Italian. Stunning inside decor & beautiful outdoor seating on a balmy summer night. Enjoyed the ""Honey Sting"" cocktail special!We tried the pasta dishes. Rigatoni with cheese was very good & my shrimp linguine was excellent.The kids meals were by far the fanciest kids meal I've seen plated. The mini sliders with the shake salad was just too cute & the 7 cheese pasta was also a big hit.Definitely a great place to have dinner. Only suggestion...would love to see some wood fired pizzas on the menu. I was shocked to find an Italian restaurant that didn't serve pizza!Desserts were also very good. Kids loved their brownie with ice cream & the molten lava cake was excellent.",Jamies Italian
50,"The food was amazing, fresh and tasty. Service and atmosphere was also great. We have a good experience with this restaurant and we will go there again :). We can recommend it.",Jamies Italian
30,Very poor service that leaves a hole in your dining experience. Overpriced for the style and quality of the food: €40 per person if you want the full experience. Not worth it just to enjoy the great atmosphere. Poor location.,Jamies Italian
50,"Delicious food, Great atmosphere, great staff,I can not fault the food here,My prawn linguini was to die forThe oven baked salmon to die forThe fried mixed seafood also delicious we had 3And I forgot to mention the cocktails!!Yum!!!!I even tried the spaghetti meatballs for kids and it's a truly home made dish that comes with fruit and veggies on the side kids are living lifeDelicious in every wayand with the kids meals all sorted what more could you ask for!",Jamies Italian
10,Even though it's a great place with a lovely garden...the food is going to stay with me as the worst experience ever. Everything seemed undercooked and tasted like nothing. Never going back for a meal.,Jamies Italian
50,"I went with family for lunch, two had the baked salmon, one had the stuffed aubergine(unfortunately didn't go down to well, bit bland), my husband had the carbonara special and I had the pumpkin ravioli.I must say the pumpkin ravioli with the sauce was really delicious, the family tried my dish and all agreed that was definitely the best dish, well done Jamie's Italian.We will go back again, although it is a bit more expensive than other Italian restaurants we use in Cyprus!",Jamies Italian
20,"We called and booked a table as we wanted a quick late lunch: We we taken to our table, sat and waited, warning signs came as the couple on the table next to us were exasperated with waiting for their bill...After a good 10 minutes we ordered, simple salads to start, 20+ minutes later we got the salads, before we finished,and we weren't hanging about, our carbonara dishes were bought and dumped on the table, for me this is the height of bad manners in a restaurant, despite a friendly waitress took an interest in us at the end (tip time?) we felt we were more ""punter"" than customer....Although we have no complaints regarding the food the service has put us off returning.",Jamies Italian
30,"The service was very good and the presentation of the meal was excellent. However, we sat outside as inside was full and there was a horrible pungent smell coming from the drains which really put us off eating and enjoying our meal. Not a good dining experience,",Jamies Italian
50,"Went with colleagues during lunch break and we had a few starters and then mains which I had steak, which was cooked really well (Med-well) and the quality of the meat was really good also. The service was also excellent and would highly recommend, whether going for lunch or for an evening meal.",Jamies Italian
40,"The service is impeccable and the staff always find something to make the visit special, whether it is the presentation of the food or the way they tell you about the day's specials.The food is simple and delicious, totally in line with what Jamie Oliver stands for.",Jamies Italian
50,"Loved the delicious food, the friendly attentive service, the Jamie O style restaurant, the way the food is served, even the toilets were amazing, just enjoyed everything! We had the artisan bread selection and garlic&chilli prawns for starters, both very yummy! The mains were burger and a pasta dish that we both enjoyed. The burger came with onions, gherkins and cheese as it should! The chips were real with the skin left on, delicious! The kids didn't like their lollipop chicken as it was slightly over cooked and a bit dry but they liked my burger and chips as well as the yogurt dip that came with their dish.Not as overpriced as some reviews claim, not cheap but not so dear either. Price-wise it was very similar to TGI's but the food at Jamie's Italian is way superior.I did not see a play area for small kids to keep busy and let adults enjoy their meal but they do supply crayons and paper to draw while they are waiting for their food.",Jamies Italian
10,"Mass production food, cheap products (eg truffle), terrible cooking (eg. chicken Milanese was over-cooked and burnt), expensive for the poor quality food it offers. We complained at the waitress but the manager did even bother coming to us and offer his apologies.",Jamies Italian
40,"We visited Jamie's with my family, I had the salmon, best I ve ever eaten. The children's menu is really attractive as kids get to choose from pictures from a plastic photo machine.Try the brownie is truly epic!Overall excellent quality food, a bit pricey and small portions.",Jamies Italian
30,"Seriously the amount of hype this place got on opening, you'd think Sushi Chef Jiro had landed in Nicosia. It's nicely decked out, the bar area is great and so is the service. But the food? It's ok nothing more, crab pasta was a bit bland, grilled chicken on a bun was on the dry side and the sauce the fish came in was very acidic. It's pricey-far more so than Just Italian across the road which is less 'in'. You'd go again but not for the food",Jamies Italian
50,we visited jamies italian for sunday lunch. it was full so thank goodness we had booked our table as we were coming from paphos. service was good. food was excellent. i ordered the lamb chops and they were fantastic. my one son had the kiddies burgers which came on a wooden Board consisting of 3 x Mini burgers and chips and salad. my kids said the chips were the best they tasted. my other son had spagetti. i had a pineapple cocktail without alchol which was fab. my husband was a little disappointed in his meal but i cannot complain about mine at all.,Jamies Italian
40,"We had lunch here on a Saturday with my husband. The food was delicious, filling and very well made. The service was efficient and friendly. A truly wonderful place for lunch or dinner. Prices on the higher end.",Jamies Italian
40,"Awesome food! Really good apetizers, main corses perfect (only maybe risotto could be not that oily), and...deserts after all that food was a bit dissapointing. Thats only reason I didnt gaved it 5 stars.Worth visiting!",Jamies Italian
10,"Food is average at most. Service is slow, attitude of the reception as if its a michelin star restaurant, not friendly at all. The prices are ridiculous. Its an airport food chain brand turned into a prime venue in Nicosia for those who have not been out if Cyprus much. Never again.",Jamies Italian
50,"I visited the restaurant today with a friend. We had rocket and parmesan salad, polenta chips, pumpkin ravioli, spaghetti carbonara, artisan breads and for desert lemon meringue cheesecake and tiramisu. Everything was made from high quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. This restaurant offers an excellent gastronomic experience in a value for money price. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice and the customer service outstanding.",Jamies Italian
30,"Visited on a Friday night. We were six in total. Ordered some appetiser platters. 8.50 per person.Asked for bread-received three pieces of bread two critsini and two pieces of Italian flat bread..at a cost of 3.20 Euros-really?Decor is fabulous, lots of room inside and outside, all the querky details make this place great. Service is outstanding.Some cocktails are slightly over priced although authentic ingredients are definitely there-same applies for the food. 24 Euros for four lamb chops!! A PRIME RIB on the same menu costs less...pricing needs looking into-even if the lamb is British!!Place is also family friendly with loads of parking space...makes you question why no one asks guests not to park in front of the entrance!",Jamies Italian
50,"The rissoto with truffle was so tasty..the starter the fresh crab brusketta was excellent, the selection of breads was so tasty and fresh. This is my favorite restaurant",Jamies Italian
20,"I visited this relatively new Jamie's Italian in Nicosia. The place is nice and lively and I was happy with the service.The food, however, was disappointing. The starter was acceptable but the main course was below expectations. The pasta was nowhere near expectations with the carbonara sauce so salty it was unreal. The tiramisu at the end was unacceptableThey need to get their act together as the place is really nice and it would be a shame to see it go without a fight",Jamies Italian
50,"Very good service overall. Waiters were very helpful. Food was amazing. I tried the spicy superfood salad and i was impressed, as well as the meatball papardelle. Beyond expectations! Definitely I will go back again.",Jamies Italian
50,"Last night i visited the place for the second time,first time was nice but this time was really great. my friend and i were seated outside which is lovely and relaxing especially summer time and we order tomato ricotta brusketta for starter and salmon ravioli for main.Both of them it was very TASTY and DELICIOUS!!During our time there,thomas was our waiter for the evening and i gotta tell you he was perfect.he was there for everything we wanted,.very polite and pleasant character.all in all we had an awesome experience at jamies thanks to the delicious food,the nice athmosphere and the amazing service.looking forward going again",Jamies Italian
40,"Went here during the first days of its operation. Nice decoration, and good selection of food and wine. Service is very attentive (Actually is the first time I saw so many waiters per customer). I'm sure it will get better in the next few months.",Jamies Italian
50,"Never have I seen so much controversy for a new comer on this list. That’s understandable though since confusion prevails over what type of restaurant Jamie’s Italian is. In my opinion, based on my personal visits there, Jamie’s is a cosy casual dining restaurant that offers a handful of classic dishes with a modern spin, and does so in a great environment. The service brings in mind a high-end American restaurant and the decoration has a British finesse. Admittedly the portions of the dishes are a bit small for the Cypriot stomach however the restaurant is constantly making changes to match the local expectations.Overall if you expect to find eccentric dishes garnished with gold and what not, then you are at the wrong establishment. Instead go for the friendliness of the stuff and stay for the fresh ingredients. And don’t forget to order the garlic bread!!",Jamies Italian
50,"I just came home from the restaurant. And I never want to return. i liked it so much that i ate so much that i became so full that i couldnt bare it anymore. starting with a delicious cocktail, to the garlic bread, my dish which was the burger and half of my friend's dish that was the italian steak. and to top it up with the lemon cheesecake...Service was very good too. quick and friendly.",Jamies Italian
20,"We visited Jamie's Italian for a Sunday lunch with 7 friends.The overall feeling from everybody that the majority of the dishes were blunt and with no depth of flavour.I had the Italian burger which although it was impressive in presentation, it proved to be very average in flavour. The fries also were very ""soggy"" and not seasoned. My wife had the pumpkin ravioli which were very average as well.The quinoa salad was very good and the dessert with the berries and the marranges was delicious as well.Excellent service though throughout our meal!I don't think we will returning back soon.",Jamies Italian
40,"Good layout, good tunes playing and decent service for Cyprus. I had the squid which thankfully I wasn't that hungry as the portion was tiny but tasty.Main course was the lamb chops which I always have. Quite a strange deconstructed idea of servicing but tasty none the less.I actually thought this was one of the cheapest ones I have been in.Would I come here again? Sure!",Jamies Italian
30,"I took the family of eight out for dinner. I booked the table and asked for a table away from a speaker so that we could talk to each other. Alas when seated we noticed that there was a speaker above us blaring out Country and western music (well that is what it sounded like to me) . I had to ask twice to have the music turned down. Maybe I am fickle but I would expect Italian music in an Italian restaurant. There's wonderful pop and folk music produced there just as I would expect Indian music in an Indian restaurant..The food generally was OK. i ordered Chicken Milanese. I didn't have a clue what I was ordering and unlike the others who went for the steak(they said it was OK) I chose something at random. I'd describe it as cardboard dipped in flour, egg and crumbs. Maybe it was overcooked or was cooked twice. Even I can make a better chicken schnitzel. I was forced to break the fried egg and spread it to make it palatable. The green salad had no dressing. The other chicken dish was average. I am use to going to a wonderful Italian restaurant in New Zealand where Jamie is hoping to open a restaurant in Wellington. La Strada has recently closed in Whanganui. The proprietor had to sell it for health reasons. A pity as it set the standard by which I judge other Italian restaurants by now. I must say that the tattooed young lady who served us was a wonderful host. I still think that restaurants should have quiet spaces in them where conversations can happen. With modern computer technology that is possible. Usually I would say something to the manager if served a mediocre meal. But being with family I wanted to spare them the embarrassment. .Christodoulos Moisa",Jamies Italian
20,"We visited last week with my three boys. When we arrived i was really happy as the place looks really nice. The decor is beautiful and the veranda is very nice and cool with ceiling fans. We ordered eight different dishes. Garlic bread and quinoa salad were good. All others were bad! Pasta with meat balls was horrible, crab spaghetti was literally crab and my little sons salmon was a bowl of red sauce with a bit of salmon swimming somewhere in there! I ate pumpkin ravioli which was average. For desert my youngest son ordered brownie with ice cream which looked amazing in the picture but when it actually arrived he said, mummy this is so small and different compared to the picture. Overall a great disappointment as the place really looks nice and we would like to visit again. Maybe next time we will try only the meat..........",Jamies Italian
50,It's about time we had a restaurant like this; the food is incredible. The menu is nothing like I've seen before.Added to my favourites!,Jamies Italian
50,"Just arrived in Nicosia this week and have been to the place twice since then. The location is really nice and I can highly recommend a table on the veranda of the restaurant. The interieur is a mix of modern Italian and the classical style of Jamie Oliver's restaurants in London. The food was great. I tried the bolognese pasta and the truffle risotto. Especially the risotto was perfect and could not be better. Coupled with the very nice and friendly staff, the restaurant is a great place to spend time for lunch or dinner. I recommend to book a table in the evenings. Five well deserved points and I will definitely go there again!",Jamies Italian
50,"I really enjoyed my meal at Jamie's. The vegetarian board was awesome, as was the squid ink pasta with seafood. We really enjoyed the lemon meringue cheesecake, too.",Jamies Italian
30,"Went to the restaurant for lunch. Interior decor is very nice and the place was really cool on a very hot day. Serving staff excellent - friendly and helpful. Not terribly impressed with the food. Starter OK but the crab spaghetti was very short on crab and long on pasta. Also had a truffle risotto - slightly on the dry side and very salty. We thought that the prices were high for Cyprus - just under 17 euros for a pasta dish, ditto the risotto.",Jamies Italian
50,Perfect food! Perfect coctails!!! Very beautiful place! Nice stuff! Smiley people!! Try the drink of the week... Is something different.,Jamies Italian
50,"Nice food, nice cocktails, nice food!!! Lovely stuff!!! Beautiful place!!! The jamie's mochito is excellent!!! You have to try it!!!",Jamies Italian
50,"One thing's for sure, its the best Italian restaurant on the Island! Easily one of the top 5 restaurants in Cyprus! Delicious food, cocktails, atmosphere and attention to detail in every little thing! Jamie's wonderful spin on each and every dish is present, you feel like you're a guest at one of his home dinner parties and hes in the back cooking all this himself. I look forward to sampling more of the menu on future visits! Great value for money, every dish we tried was wonderful. The lemon meringue cheesecake for desert is the one to go for!",Jamies Italian
50,Excellent Service !DELICIOUS Food !High quality of food !They really made me feel fantastic !U have to visit!Do not forget to taste the best cheesecake ... No words to describe !!!,Jamies Italian
50,"Had an excellent time in this restaurant. Also great service by our waiter Nicholas. Great food, great atmosphere. It fullfilled all of my expectations for this high-reputation restaurant. I will certainely visit Jamie's Italian again!",Jamies Italian
50,Service was fast with a very welcoming and friendly staff. Good ambiance and delicious food. What more could anyone want? Will definitely be coming back.,Jamies Italian
50,"Based on Italian recipes and ingredients, lasagne, permesan etc, this place offers a nice and healthy attitude in food with a bit of jamies twist. If u wonder yes it feels as if Mr. Oliver has cooked the dishes. Try the avocado superfood salad and the kids very healthy menu...",Jamies Italian
30,"Went shortly after opening with friends and we all agreed that the service, despite some teething problems, was excellent and the place was really nice. The attention to detail was more than obvious. The food, however, just didn't excite and the prices seemed a bit out of touch, especially with the quality, taste-wise, of the items we tried.It's a pity as we absolutely love some of Jamie's recipes at our household and we often use them either for entertaining or for a family meal.Unless things improve greatly, and from the newer reviews it seems that there's still work to do, I'm afraid Jamie's name will not be able to sustain the business for long.",Jamies Italian
30,"Been to this restaurant twice,so this is not a rushed review. Tasted five dishes and am still to be impressed. I am a big fan of Jamie's and like his cooking style, so was excited to try the restaurant. We arrived and were greeted, escorted to our table and ordered within 5 min. Nice so far. Between my two visits we tried the Italian steak, ribeye, pork chop, burger, and the rigatoni. Both visits it took the kitchen about 35-40 min to prepare, and both were on quiet days. Both times we were on a lunch break and in a hurry to get back, and ended being late. That aside and not to say that the food was bad, the experience was nothing special, have eaten all dishes at other restaurants around town and enjoyed them more. Overall ok, with a relatively expensive price to food ratio.",Jamies Italian
50,"Lovely espresso -martini.. Recommended by Thomas the manager he was right! Yummy carbonate, wished the quantity was more.. Cheesecake.. Out of this world, would go again even if I am not hungry just for the dessert. Beautiful outdoor surrounding.",Jamies Italian
30,The service was terrible. Starters were not worth trying and were expensive. Main courses were tasteful and of good quantity and quality.,Jamies Italian
50,"Great Ambience,Nice service (Nikolas) a very smiley person who recommended very nice daily dishes and proper attentive service. Great food and wide selection. Will definetely come back. Kudos to all",Jamies Italian
40,"I visited Jamie's twice in the last 3 days. I must say I was impressed on both occasions. The experience, either on the veranda (lovely green surroundings) or inside (beautiful decor), the restaurant is excellent.The staff are very polite and make you feel comfortable. The choice on the menu is not very extensive, but I would recommend the garlic bread, super food salad, pumpkin ravioli and the hamburger. Would have liked to have seen a bigger selection of beer. Will definitely become a regular.",Jamies Italian
50,The best restaurant in Town. Food rocks and the environment is modern and cozy.Best carbonara i have ever eat and the cocktails are the best i ever tasted.Service is perfect and the staff always there to assist you.,Jamies Italian
40,"Jamie's opened about two months ago and several of our friends that visited gave us mixed reviews. We were told that it is very busy and therefore took advantage of the Kataklismos weekend when many Cypriots leave town for the sea to book.We asked for a table outside and were seated next to a pair of loudspeakers. We expressed our discomfort and were re seated twice until we were happy.We shared a meat platter and a veggy platter for starters. After that my partner had lamb chops and I settled for chicken. All the food was well prepared, ingredients were fresh and everything tasted freshly prepared. The desert was delicious.Jamie's is certainly a positive addition to the restaurant scene in Nicosia.I just have a few remarks. First of all the menu is very simple. No veal, no osso bucco, no dishes from the great Italian cuisine.And the music belongs more in a Buddha bar or a disco. Finally try to eat outside. The inside is extremely noisy.",Jamies Italian
40,"We went with an apprehensive state of mind because of the negative comments we heard. However we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant has a beautiful rustic decor, nice ambiance and the staff is extremely polite and friendly. The food was also excellent with fresh, vibrant flavours. The portions were quite big and the prices were good. We paid a total of 150 euro for 3 starters, 4 adults, 2 kids, coctails and 4 desserts.",Jamies Italian
50,Nice atmosphere and very good service.The menu is just what you want to have for a great dinner.The waiters were very responsive and helpful especially Anna who was ....dedicated to our table.,Jamies Italian
30,"Jamies has a nice place, well decorated that gives you a warm feeling. Good service with trained employees as it has to be for such a place.The food was good taste but expensive. I ""play it"" safe on my 1st visit so i order carbonara which was very good in taste, but not the best i ever had for sure. Greens salad was also freah and tastefull. For starter the mix cheese and meat plate was a good taste i admit , of 2 salami and prosuto and 1 cheese, all in very small portions(for example cheese was 10g for each person order the plate).Plate even through good taste,disappointed me cause of size and selection(at least 4 selection of each meat and cheese should be in any ""self-respected"" plater)To sum up, jamies have a good taste food but nothing exceptional. It is an other franchise like fridays and bennigans in more expensive and classy italian way, but still a franchise place",Jamies Italian
30,We were very excited to eat there but unfortunately we were disappointed. We had tried 3 different pasta dishes and non of it was worth it. They were not bad but definitely not special. Garlic bread was different but again nothing special.,Jamies Italian
50,"We order the meatball papardelle, superfood salad and the burger. Everything was perfect. We were treated like royals. Excellent service and food.",Jamies Italian
50,"Everything was just perfect and topped every expectation! All dishes are unique and cooked in a gourmet style, yet they satisfy all tastes. I cannot imagine how somebody cannot fall in love with the pumpkin ravioli, the prawn linguini, the crab spagetti, the truffle risotto or the superfood salad. This is not just another fairly good Italian eatery. So delicious and enjoyable with the signature of Jamie Oliver. Portions are also satisfactory, this is just wonderful. A true gastronomic experience, a 'must visit' for every visitor in Nicosia. I am so happy that we have this new entry in town :)))",Jamies Italian
20,"Despite the well decorated place, the very friendly staff and quick service, a good restaurant is ultimately judged by its food. Only the salad (tomato based) was above average. The Chicken Cacciatore and the Prawn pasta were just OK, and the Aubergines under-cooked and uninteresting. And what is the point of asking if the food is OK if the customer says the aubergine is under-cooked and there is no response/action? We are definitely not going back and not recommending this place unless something changes in the kitchen.",Jamies Italian
30,"Five of us went here for my husband's birthday, among us were 2 vegans and one vegetarian. From the set-off there was only one purely vegan option, and that was a salad?! Thankfully they were willing to edit some vegetarian dishes to make them dairy free, however as a ""Jamie"" restaurant there definitely needs to be more vegetarian and vegan options! Its quite unacceptable that there are no purely vegan main meals.. The other 2 people had meat for main and one of them barely touched his chicken because it seemed undercooked for his liking and not well prepared. For starters we ordered a vegetable plank for one, which in the end had more cheese than vegetables (there was a tiny plate of grilled vegetables topped with 3 olives), so considering we are dairy-free, this was upsetting and not as described in the menu! For starters we also had the ""italian nachos"" which were quite basic in flavour. For mains I had the pumpkin ravioli which i must admit was nice, possibly the best dish out of all of us. I The service was good however. Prices were a tad on the expensive side for the quality of food received. A comment we all made, was the absence of pizzas on an italian menu.. Don't think either of us will return.",Jamies Italian
50,"I have visited Jamies oliver restaurant in London and was really impressed. I was kinda holding back for the Nicosia restaurant but i have to admit that i was surprised! From the moment i stepped in they treated us as royals! That's the way they made us feel. The service was excellent, the food much better!! I tried the black spagheti nero. Really recommended. As for their desserts? I am just saying that i couldnt finish it as i was so full! It was a sweet explosion in my mouth! So over my general expectation! WELL DONE!",Jamies Italian
50,"Very good food, amaizing place, and friendly staff... The portions are good enough, the garlic bread is amazing, and the best choice to start your dinner. The other favourite is the Meetball pasta... So big portion, and so so delicious. Just cant stop to eat it.. the only bad point is that when its busy, the outside area get very very noisy...Keep it up guys, see you soon",Jamies Italian
50,"Highly recommended for staff courtesy and attention, knowledge of food preparation and sourcing, exquisite flavours, rustic and tasteful decor plus a friendly manager Thomas.",Jamies Italian
50,Excellent food amazing service and staff!! Definitely will come back for Jamie's food again!! Thomas Desert!!!!,Jamies Italian
50,"Excellent food, drinks, service. Exceptional restaurant with high standards, excellent patio and garden. Friendly well trained staff ready to help you at all times. Keep it up guys we will for sure return.",Jamies Italian
50,"Excellent food, service! U must visit!!! Garlic bread is a MUST!!! Thank u guys so much, i ll re visit soon... Quality of cocktails is amazing too.",Jamies Italian
30,"Menu is only in English...first negative impression! Both Pork Chops were overcooked! Prawn linguine was just ok. For Four people (with only 1 glass of wine), 2 soft drinks and water, we paid 99 eurossssssss",Jamies Italian
50,"We have been to Jamie's on three separate occasions and it just gets better and better! First of all there is a buzz that you only get in restaurants abroad mostly due to the amount of staff and the gorgeous decor. The service is impeccable and the food is great. Its simple Italian food with a twist (its not pretending to be something else) and the portions are massive. What's even better is that we have finally found a restaurant in Cyprus with a healthy children's menu: for 6.5 euro each our children had a large pasta dish, with a side salad and unlimited fruity water which they absolutely loved and made us very pleased too! We travel a lot and as far as value for money goes, Jamie's Italian in Nicosia can only really compare with international restaurants. Would strongly recommend especially to those with children, cannot wait to go again!",Jamies Italian
40,It is a totally new experience in Cyprus. The food is good and the service is also very good. They serve some nice starters as well the traditional burgers.,Jamies Italian
50,"Beautiful decor, although a little heavy on the ""promotional items"".Cant fault the service, all the staff were very friendly, attentive and damn it, attractive!Was lovely to see the open kitchen area so you could watch your food being prepared.A great atmosphere, and very child friendly.Tasty food, wonderfully presented.Even though the place was very busy, we were not rushed in any way.",Jamies Italian
50,I enjoyed every moment .... The food is excellent .The service was at the spot. We were served by Razvan a very good waiter. That introduced us to the hole menu.,Jamies Italian
10,"I visited the restaurant with a friend as we were curious to try it out. We arrived, gave the name of the reservation and were immediately seated outside. At the first instance, what my friend and I said is that the outside area was too noisy. We could hardly hear each other. The waiter came and politely gave us the menus while announcing tonight's special. What I had noticed from the menu is that the selection of items is small but adequate to satisfy most tastes. I chose the spaghetti nero (black) with seafood and in fact pointed to the food with my finger when the waiter was taking the order. My friend had the burger which she requested well done but the waiter said it only come in one way (the chef's way apparently). When the food came some time later I noticed that my spaghetti was white, not black. I called the waiter back to say that I had ordered something else and his response was 'I repeated the order to you'. Indeed, he had but it was so noisy I could not hear him and never actually said that the order was fine (my friend had, I just commented that I had no idea what he said due to the noisy background). I then politely asked if I can send the wrong order back and he said the kitchen is too busy right now! So I asked him, what am I forcibly having then? He replied fresh crab spaghetti. I like crab so I said ok although I was disappointed as I really wanted the black seafood pasta. From the first bite I could tell the pasta was too dry, it was so dry it stuck together! I presume they must have cooked it in advance and it got stuck. Overall, I was far from impressed, could have cooked better pasta at home. Then when the bill came I noticed the crab pasta was more expensive that the one I had ordered (and pointed!). Not only did the waiter bring the wrong plate without apologizing, he didn't even offer us dessert (as compensation) or at least allow me to pay the price for the food I had initially ordered! I'll never be visiting this restaurant again, the food is not that good and the prices too high, the ambience is ruined by the noisy background and the waiters are obviously untrained! Shame...",Jamies Italian
40,Nicely decorated. The ravioli was perfectly cooked and the tiramisu was very tasty: I recommend. The service was ok. To improve: Staff should SMILE!! Client will feel welcomed and happy!,Jamies Italian
40,"We were at this restaurant for lunch; the reservation was perfectly handled and the reception was very warm.The restaurant is in a perfect location at the back side of Alpha Mega Super Market; with ample parking space. It is huge with very beautiful decoration indoor and a very pleasant outdoor area.The service was so efficient and nice; finished plates were removed fast; the tables cleaned and cutlery replaced after each course.The menu is a simple and well classified; containing a very clear and detailed description of a good variety of food that would satisfy any taste.The food quality was generally fine; the Garlic Bread was freshly made and extremely delicious, the smoked Salmon Salad was good, the Risotto was flat taste, the Chicken Milanese was burned, the Hamburger was good but we wonder why it was served on a wooden board; On the other hand the Ice Cream, the Sorbet and the Cheese Cake were superb and very delicious.",Jamies Italian
40,"The place is very cosy with a friendly, family feel to it. Our waiter Christopher was very attentive and the manager Thomas dedicated to his mission! The food was very tasty and nicely presented. The portions are just right. The prices are correct for the quality you get. Will definitely recommend it and go back again.",Jamies Italian
30,"After all the hype around Jamie we really wanted to try his restaurant. As a rule we avoid visiting such places in the early days because of the usual teething problems, so we waited two plus months. The service was very good with friendly staff; some amateurish mistakes can be forgiven. But the food was well below average. For starters the “super food salad” was completely tasteless, spaghetti overcooked, but mud overcooked and tasteless, burger tasteless, overdone and dry as a bone. The rest of the dishes do not worth a mention. If the bill we had to pay was fast-food level, the above would not be justified. But the bill was above mid range pricing. We are seriously disappointed.",Jamies Italian
40,"As all Jamie Oliver's restaurants, this restaurant is also well organised with very friendly and polite staff, quick service and warm atmosphere.But there is not a big selection of dishes and the portion of the food compared to the price is, in my opinion, small.",Jamies Italian
50,"Not sure about the bad reviews, but this restaurant is easily by far the best meal and Italian experience we had in Cyprus.Service is caring and fast, food is great - fresh, tasty, huge portions! price is not that high, more of a mid-range (although some items are of/aims to high-range).don't miss the desserts! and take your time, enjoy the atmosphere.oh, the design is brilliant and detailed!",Jamies Italian
30,"Overall good, nothing special, a little more expensive for the quality we received, small variety, friendly staff",Jamies Italian
50,"From my point of view there are very few good restaurants in Cyprus.This restaurant provides a different selection of dishes,good quality of food,(which is the most important for me) good service and a very modern place to eat.I ordered for starter the garlic bread (which is really tasty) for main I had the pasta with the prawns which despite the ""small"" portion it was enough for me together with some delicious desert! (try the brownie its amazing!!!)Of course I didn't expect from in a restaurant like this (which the quality of the food is amazing) to be cheap but the prices were reasonable comparing with other restaurants in Cyprus. (For example Akakiko, Domus)I will definitely go back.",Jamies Italian
30,Was expecting very tasty very wow but was disappointed. I was served the milanese with just an egg on top. When asked regards to fries they told me it's extra. The pasta sauce was very watery and the amount of pasta you got the portion would be for a child. The tomato salad was the best thing ordered together with the dessert. Not sure if I would go back as it's a bit pricey. I'd I do I will try the burger which looked nice,Jamies Italian
50,"The family and daughters' friends enjoyed the meal, atmosphere and friendly service. The restaurant is well placed and has tons of parking space",Jamies Italian
50,"Excellent service and food at a high standard.Great place for business lunch, and special time out with the family.Very pleasant surroundings.Simple to book, and find. Was good to have attentive service during our recent business lunch of 5. Will come back again for sure.",Jamies Italian
20,"The decor was OK; however, the atmosphere was very loud. The food was good quality but very bland and we did not appreciate the fast food thin fries with the 20-euro plate,There is a McDonald's across the street if I wanted that. The pasta was OK, but Cyprus has very good restaurants so Jamie's really has to step it up and adapt to stay in this market. The service and waiting time was very good.",Jamies Italian
20,"My partner and I were very much looking forward to our night at Jamie Oliver. We had travelled from Paphos and arranged a stay over trip for my birthday. It was also the first night away from our 1 year old son who was having a sleep over with nana.Friendly, helpful, professional staff let down by poor quality food! The starters were bland and tasteless,, not sure they had ever seen any crab and my partners steak was poorly cooked and very tough with nothin more than a mushroom and handful of rocket out of a packet on top. He actually did not eat it which is something very unusual for him. On a positive my prawn pasta was lovely and i really enjoyed that. Due to an overall negative experience we decided to leave early and not have dessert which is something I never usually miss.",Jamies Italian
40,"First visit to this newly opened restaurant. I was a little apprehensive about going there as when I visited their branch in Hong Kong they were unable to serve a Spaghetti Carbonara! No reason given just ""it's off!"" However, we were very happy with Nicosia. Nice atmosphere & very friendly & knowledgeable staff. My Spaghetti Carbonara was excellent and my friend enjoyed her Spaghetti Bolonaise. Each to access & lots of free parking",Jamies Italian
40,friendly helpful staff. Good tasty food(we had pasta in various versions) A bit overpriced . Will definitely return,Jamies Italian
50,"Excellent atmosphere and service, very good foodIt is a beautiful restaurant with top service. Its antipasti is amazing and super fresh, its home made bread and pasta was very good. Up to this point the food was very good.The steak was cooked very well done.The deserts were very good. The cost was mid-range.",Jamies Italian
20,"We live in the Paphos area and had decided to spend a few days in Nicosia with a visit to Jamie Oliver's new restaurant on my birthday. We went with some friends and we were all very disappointed. The service was good but the food was poor. In fact, the crab starter which two of us had was so bad that we complained (you could not taste the crab) and, in all fairness to the manager, he did not charge us for those starters. The other starter, a chill prawn dish, was so small that the whole thing hardly amounted to a mouthful. The spaghetti with crab was small, not very tasty and contained very little crab. My husband's steak was chewy and sinewy and our friend's crispy squid was not crispy. The only redeeming feature was the desserts. The cost was not cheap. We felt that Jamie Oliver is trying to expand his chain too quickly and quality is suffering without his personal touch. It is a shame, as he is seemingly a very talented chef. We had been looking forward to celebrating my birthday at Jamie Oliver's but the evening was ruined by the poor food.",Jamies Italian
40,"The place is very inviting. Nice decor, effective lighting, nice energy to it. There is some noise in the background as it is a big place. Nice outdooor sitting as well. We sat indoors but want to try the outdoor sitting too.Service was fast and waiters polite. As a starter we shared the crab and avocado bruschetta which was very tasty. As a main i tried the pumpkin ravioli which i really enjoyed (rather unique taste). Cocktails served as well. All the people at the table were happy with their food (burger, lamp chops etc). The deserts were OK but could be better. We all said we want to visit again to try other dishes. The prices are ok - a bit on the high side.",Jamies Italian
10,"Worst restaurant ever.. Never saw a more uprofessional bunch of waiiters (one of them tried to discuss his salary with us!), there were no placemats (cutlery direcrtly on the wooden table!), coasters or napkins, the ""food"" was tasteless and greasy. My chicken milanese was thin as paper, deep fried in old oil and served with a sad pile of dry rocket. My friend had a very questionable crab spaghetti (not homemade of course, shame on you, Jamie) which was very acidy and seemed to be rotten. We both left the restaurant feeling literally sick. never going back. Place looks lovely but I came to eat and not to admire interiors.",Jamies Italian
20,"Unfortunately not what we expected.Starter where of medium taste and quality but the mains where really really really disappointing.We were a group of nine and all nine dishes were medium to bad quality and taste.Chicken milanese was actually an oily schnitzel, chicken cacciatore tasted nothing like one and so on...Definitely not met our expectations of a Jamie's restaurant and that is sad.We won't visit again.",Jamies Italian
20,"Writing this at the table after dinner. In a group of 9 people, we tried 9 dishes, only the carbonara was passable. The food is truly bad, most of our group left their plates half full. And it is a shame as I was looking forward to tonight's dinner. Worst of all was the hair in one of the plates, which was deep fried with the chicken milanaise.The atmosphere is nice, service is OK, even though the food came rather late but ok. I don't see the restaurant surviving in a city with such a rich option in great restaurants.",Jamies Italian
20,"It is a beautiful restaurant with top top top service. Its antipasti is amazing and super fresh, its home made bread and pasta was very good. The black pasta was not so tasty though. Up to this point the food was very good. Then the main courses came and the things went pretty bad. The steak was cooked very well done, while the waiters advertised the steak to be cooked at 70 degrees and told us we should expect it to be served medium rear. When I complained they apologised but at the end they charged it at my bill. I had to ask them to take it out of the bill since it wasnt served as it should and we didnt eat it. They did but the excuse wasnt convincing by one of the waiters: ""the steak cannot be served every time the same... sometimes it can be medium and sometimes well done, depending on how thick the steak is cut..."" Whatttt???? Oh my God. Anyway... They should just say sorry. The chicken was very oily, more than it should... The deserts were very good. My favourite desert was the lemon cheesecake. Amazing. The cost was quite high too. I paid 86 euros for two persons with a glass of wine and without charging me the steak. Conclusion: With my experience i would say the kitchen needs some time to adjust. I will try the food in a few months hoping that things will be better. Now it was not very good...",Jamies Italian
40,"In the Coffee Shop zone of Engomi, next to Alfa Mega, with ample parking. Only just opened - very friendly and helpful staff who had good menu knowledge. Special attention for kids, with a baby chair, crayons and a paper to draw on..... (Plus small kids play area where they can eat). Came just before opening time but were seated immediately - drinks came very quickly. Food Order taken quickly and food came quickly - the Special of the Day - pumpkin ravioli with smoked salmon looked attractive but was only Lukewarm (€14.90), the Black Truffle risotto was colourless and did not look attractive but was very tasty and hot (€16.80), Funky chips as side dish were very tasty (€3.00). 2 glasses of Petritis Xynisteri (18.75cl) €4.70 each and Sprite €2.80. Were asked how meal was and when we told the waiter about the ravioli, he checked with his Supervisor, and immediately offered a complimentary dessert. We chose a lemon flavoured cheese cake, - very nice but more of a lemon meringue pie with a cheesecake filling. Total bill €46.90",Jamies Italian
20,"I visited Jamie's in London, in Garwick, and Now in Cyprus. Always same impression, fast food place with a twist. They gave it a nice setting and that is it. New venue in town and people are going crazy over it, give it a few months just like hard rock cafe story. Food is below par compared to any local taverna in Cyprus let alone our fieh taverns. Portions are tiny for the price charged. Third time and never again. Jamie's better to stick to the tv show.",Jamies Italian
50,Unbiased independent feedback. Top restaurant in town. Fresh and healthy food! Warm and cozy ambience! The best service I have ever had in Cyprus.,Jamies Italian
50,"Believe it or not, we very nearly didn't go today! We have read some bad reviews, and we even tried to cancel the reservation, but they were engaged continuously.So I said, obviously we are not meant to cancel, and we went.All I can say is, the people who wrote those bad reviews are probably owners of some other restaurant or something. Either that, or they are simply cognitively challenged.The service was excellent. The food was excellent. The menu was excellent. The decor was excellent.If youre looking for cheap and cheerful, don't go to Jamie's Italian. But if you're looking for a really nice place to sit and enjoy a marvelous meal, then Jamie's is definitely top on that list.I cant see how anyone could possibly regret eating at Jamie's Italian restaurant.",Jamies Italian
40,"Jamies's is a relatively new restaurant with a family atmosphäre, good decoration, a lot of space for family with kids, good food and beverage, and even enough parking spaces available",Jamies Italian
40,"We visited the place onnly 3 days after it opened with our 2 year old son.The whole place is really impressive. Perfectly decorated, a bar to have cocktails and drinks, open plan kitchen to see what's cooking, high tables on the outside for smokers etc. Staff number was really impressive. They were all over the place.We felt really comfortable and they immediately brought us a sketching sheet and crayons for our son and some lovely toy goggles for him to check out the menu.We ordered the scallops and a super food salad for starters, a burger and pasta with meatballs for mains and shared a tiramisu for dessert.Everything(but the tiramisu of course) was unseasoned! No salt and pepper at all! We had to season everything ourselves which was not the best solution. Leaving that aside the scallops were cooked perfectly, the salad was good but a bit spicy so be careful. The burger was also very good but a bit flat. The pasta was probably the best dish of the night along with the huge and really really good tiramisu.Prices are a bit high but it is expected since all ingredients are of high quality and from the best suppliers on the island. Overall a great experience for us and our son and we are definitely returning to see if they manage to season the food to perfection!",Jamies Italian
30,"I love Jamie's Italian restaurants - they are probably my favourite in UK - especially the one in Bath and in Kingston.Sadly Nicosia Jamie's is not up to scratch, at least not yet. It only opened last week and I assume things can only get better. The restaurant in my opinion is not in a great location and took us a long time to drive through all the traffic lights from Debenhams (about 30 minutes) and this was at a quiet time of the day. However, interior of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful, a lot of money has been spent on its appearance.I had the meatballs which did not remotely compare with those in UK - these were made from pork and were dry and tasteless. We had to ask for parmesan.Good to see both Italian and Cypriot wine on the menu although it is overpriced - a rather mediocre white at Euro 6.5 per 175 ml glass is more than we normally pay in decent restaurants in Cyprus.Staff were pleasant but some looked rather confused; training is still in evidence.Hopefully things will improve and we will give it a few months before visiting again.",Jamies Italian
30,"Jamie's Italian started operating a few days ago. It's very nicely decorated and has a great atmosphere. We visited over the weekend and although we enjoyed the appetizers and desserts, we found the main courses not upto standard. The staff however were quite welcoming.",Jamies Italian
