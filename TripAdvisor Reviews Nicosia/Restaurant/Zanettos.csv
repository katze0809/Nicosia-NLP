50,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best taverns in the old town of Nicosia. Friendly staff and owner, very good service, food was absolutely amazing and the quantity was way more than what we could handle. we actually took the rest home :). We were a group of 10, and the bill was about 25 euros per person which in my opinion is absolutely fine. Everyone was happy with their food and service and top it all, the owner bought us a couple of rounds of drinks.A+++ strongly recommend this place.And I will definitely visit this place when i am in Cyprus again",Zanettos
30,"Just ok. Friendly staff, good and fast service but not much variety of food and definitely not delicious. The price it was good, I won't say that is cheap, for the quality of food that I ate. I will not chose this place for food.",Zanettos
30,Meze is definitely well cooked and quantity is a lot but variety is basic. For meat Meze the price is on the end. You can get very good fish Meze at a better rate.,Zanettos
50,"This place is legendary. The food is just great both in quality and quantity. Actually, the servings were so big that we ended up taking away food for a week. Trust me, it‚Äôs tasty and it‚Äôs never ending so if you want to try it all, keep that in mind.",Zanettos
50,"Great food, plenty of food, all is food there. Nice place to visit when being in Lefkosia...don't miss it...",Zanettos
30,We were three people and wanted to order meze for two. They said meze is fixed according to number of people and cannot change. So we had to order meze for three that was too much food. Also the food was not as tasty as we had expected.. Good thing they make homemade koumantaria.,Zanettos
50,"Located in the heart of the old city of nicosia. It is the oldest taverna in the city. The old building preserves the tradition and culture of old Cyprus. Serves local and traditional dishes, meze type. Music on weekends. Can accommodate groups and individuals. Can prepare vegetarian meals.",Zanettos
40,"Good meze, rip off tourist prices, extremely small interior but looks very retro inside, if it was bigger it'd be great",Zanettos
50,"I visit the place quite often. Very friendly atmosphere, attentive staff. The food is more than enough, big variety. Alway a lovely experience to visit.",Zanettos
40,"So much food, youll have to be really hungry or 4people.I felt bad i was not able to eat more and they brought more and more food.(i was not aware of the concept, so my fault not the restaurant)Autentisk food and Great service and Great prices, Just not to my taste.",Zanettos
50,"Went on the recommendations of several........ not at all disappointed, well, except that we were beaten and could not manage all the 21 courses - about 5 courses shy of completion!! The food was excellent, service was faultless and atmosphere superb. The place filled quickly, so we are lucky to have gone early....would love to go again when in the area, but will need to starve for a week first....what an outstanding meze.",Zanettos
50,"Cyprus Meze!! the best place, good quality of food and a huge variety of cypriot dishes!! the stuff amazing and really friendly!!",Zanettos
50,"This is the place to go if you want to experience Cypriot food. Book ahead as it is usually packed with people and very lively. They keep bring out meze, until you are fit to burst. Highly recommended, all the food is fresh and very very tasty,",Zanettos
50,"The only thing you have to do is to order what you want to drink!!!! everything else is at zanetos hand..... great dishes, original cyprus cuisine. I count 24 dishes.... Just great!!!!",Zanettos
40,Huge meze selection Liked the service and quality of food Priced above average for such places Felt welcome,Zanettos
50,"It is the perfect place to go for a person who has never tried the Cypriot or Greek cuisine in the past. The meze of Zannettos includes pretty much everything, and in good amount. We were five people and were served enough food to eat twice. The food was well cooked and tasted the way it should. The staff was very friendly and always very close to us and ready to provide what we needed. We were served traditional desert and drinks after the meal, which were also great. The environment in the restaurant was great. It was not a surprise that it was full.",Zanettos
30,"Here you are definitely going to eat a lot and many different small dishes. There are plenty of dishes made of vegetables like green salads of different types, mushrooms, fried zucchini stripes. One can also find dairy dishes, ravioles, grilled halloumi and definitely meat dishes (souvlaki,shieftalia, pork in wine, sausage etc). If you are visiting the place be advised to eat light meals during the day. The food is cooked in the old traditional way which make it a bit heavy. We visit the restaurant once a year just to remind us how it is.",Zanettos
30,"This is typical meze place where you don't order your food but the menu is fixed and you pay per person + drinks.The first time I've visited this place I felt like I was being punished and I had to eat more than I could.When my family visited they wanted to visit zanetos to see what is the fuss about.We were welcomed by the owner with a drop of rose water on our hands. If someone is allergic to rose, like my sister, don't hand your hand!The food they serve is in great quantity but it is very heavy and I don't think they ever even wondered if the dishes match the previous one in any way.First they bring yogurt and some salds, then different types of meat and halumi and at the very end, just before sweet, a huge plate of snails.This place is ideal for those who enjoy eating big quantities but a person who seeks flavours and quality will be disappointed.I don't think I will ever visit again, only if anyone else is visiting us again and insist on going.",Zanettos
50,Propably the best tavern in cyprus i am visiting this tavern for many years and is always perfect... It offers a perfect selection of plates (meze)... The plates nevers stops coming... Only wow can discripe it,Zanettos
50,"What a great quirky restaurant , the food just keeps coming and it is all fantastic. The setting is not fancy but for an experience of old Cyprus with great vast quantities of food , you can‚Äôt miss this place , great prices too üëç",Zanettos
50,"If you are going to zanettos make sure to be very very hungry. The diversity of food is great, there are meny options for vegetarians and even vegans (both me and my husband are). For meat eaters, the options are endless. The food is delicious and the atmosphere could not be more authentic. The place goes back for at least two generations. The owner is almost always there with a kind smile to supervise the best quality service. It is the most generous and friendly tavern we've been to to. If you are looking for an experience that you'll never foget, that the place to go!!",Zanettos
40,"This restaurant does one course only: a table full of mezze. A lot of mezze, and really a lot of it! different veggies, fried zucchini, tahini, yoghurt, salad, four kinds of meat, fries, potatoes, rice.. And all of good fresh homemade quality for about 25 euros each. Nice chardonnay from Cyprus.And despite of the comment before this one: it is no waste at all, because they kindly ask you if you want to take the rest home with you, gave us two aluminium boxes and a bag. So we'll have enough lunch and dinner for tomorrow. Well done, Zanettos!",Zanettos
20,"The food was decent but the quantity was irresponsibly out of this world. There was no way you could eat all that food. Too much waste and the owner very strange in his responses to our comments. Nonsense. We asked him to stop bringing more but he just ignored us. House policy he claimed. A total waste, inhumane and disrespectful in so many levels.",Zanettos
50,"Nice restaurant with good food and service , reasonable prices. Traditional cuisine and building in the city center of Nicosia.",Zanettos
30,"A vast variety of typical Cyprus mezedes, generally delicious. This is one of the Old tavernas in Nicosia, located in the Old Town.The place is a but run down and would need more attention to the quality of tableware etc. The staff could compensate, if they were a bit more attentive and polite. The taverna is not bad, but its level not attracting diners.",Zanettos
50,"Bring a huge appetite and plenty of time, probably best to skip or go light on lunch as dish after dish after dish keeps coming. I think there are something like 20+ small plates served with plenty of options for our vegetarian member as well as the omnivores. The host was awesome, the atmosphere local and joyful, loved it!",Zanettos
10,"Horrible place, very nonchalant staff who had ""read the script"" too many times and made me feel like that. Ordered a vegetarian set meal and was very quickly served gloop. There was no love or thought in the way the food had been put together. The feta salad was badly chopped cucumber, tomato and pepper with a large rectangular lump of feta on top, sprinkled with herbs. It was so unappetising for 16euros, I walked out of a restaurant for the first time in my life.Vegetarians and food lovers do not go there!",Zanettos
50,"What a range!! Great quality so one cannot stop overeating. Don't be put off by the outside or the back street location. Go on, eat, eat and eat more. Leave room for dessert!!",Zanettos
50,"This place was recommended to us by our airbnb host. It was great. Food is simple but good, very fresh and huge quantities. You should pace yourself, eat only what you like, and make peace with the fact that you will not eat a good fraction of the food.",Zanettos
40,"We were here the end of january and were the only tourists. We did not reserve but came early and half an hour later the place was crammed. The owner is overwhelming in a very nice way, and so is the food. The amounts are enormous, the quality is good (a nice introduction to Cypriotic food) but the food comes in an unstoppable flood. Even for big eaters like us it is too much but this seems to be normal. Avoid when you are a small or fussy eater, this is not your place. Good local wines. Some dishes were really good ! Sit back and enjoy the ride is the word here. Crazy evening. Nice people, great noisy and very vivid atmosfere. We loved it.",Zanettos
50,"Prepare yourself for an amazing food journey through Cypriot mezze. This place serves nothing else. You pay per guest and its the full deal or nothing. No menu just eating. We got 26 dishes and everything was very well prepared and fresh. Local wines are simple and affordable yet very good company to the mezze food.You start with salads, herbs and skordalia and travel through several grilled meats ,Cypriot sausage and Sheftalia to sauteed snails and even home-made village-style ravioli.If you are not almost full at half of the meal you probably did something wrong. Almost impossible to finish all the food, as they keep bringing your favourites again and again if you with so.Desserts are semolina and pudding based with only a mild sweetness and accompanied by fruit and preserves.Overall friendly and very fast service and very good value for money.",Zanettos
50,"Wow...just the most incredible meze I‚Äôve had the privilege of eating. Very authentic Cypriot food, fresh and delicious., simple and very plentiful. The interior is lovely, it‚Äôs like your stepping into someone‚Äôs living room. If your in the district of old town Nicosia then you must visit. It‚Äôs hidden away in one of the back streets but worth seeking out.",Zanettos
40,"Great variety. Can be an one time experience for visitors. My advise to visitors is to be selective in what they try ,otherwise they will b3 pretty full very quickly without being able to taste the last servings.",Zanettos
50,"The restaurant is located in the heart of old Nicosia, it‚Äôs well maintained clean and a happy place to visit. Panayiotis the owner as soon as you sit he will offer church blessed rose water to wash your hands.The food served is excellent traditional Cyprus cuisine and will remind guests their mothers kitchen. Service is curtious and fast and the waiters always tell customers of the food they are serving. Price is also quite reasonable.All in all its a great place to visit.",Zanettos
20,"Who can eat so much food? It‚Äôs a shameful waste! Moreover, the food is not good. I am disappointed and don‚Äôt understand why there are many people dining here. (Only one set menu, ‚Ç¨21, which is not expensive.)",Zanettos
30,The atmosphere is traditional for a cyprus tavern/ restaurant The staff is very polite and friendly The service is excellent The food is of good quality and the quantity is well above average Unfortunately it is overpriced,Zanettos
30,"One of the oldest tavern in Nicosia old city with traditional character...small place so i recommended reservation. Here you try the traditional meze plates so, especially for tourists who say near the old town is ideal. Is located in the cozy streets of old city and you can reach it on foot if you stayed in the area.",Zanettos
40,"Popular Cyprus food restaurant, popular for many years now. Cozy small place, traditional menu and good flavors.",Zanettos
50,"Zanettos is relatively unassuming, tucked away in a quiet street in the old town, but with a warm welcome and an intimate atmosphere, dominated by knickknacks and hundreds of photos of previous guests. The food is great, served in abundance, just when you think you cannot eat any more, yet more arrives, looking so attractive that you have to just keep tucking in. Fantastic for a group looking for a great evening out.",Zanettos
20,"Ok so the deal was to enjoy a traditional mezze in one of the oldest restaurants in Nicosia. There are pictures of celebrities that ate here. From the get go, the owner told us that we have to pay mezze for each person which was a bit unfair because half of our party would not be able to eat huge amounts. But I guess he wanted to make sure that each one of us will fork out the 20 euros. And at 11 persons that would make a nice sum. Of course the 20 euros does not include any drinks!The food was disappointing. Rice was flavorless so were the mushrooms. And the snails were soaked in a tomato sauce totally disgusting. I do not recommend this place as it is way overpriced for the quality it offers.",Zanettos
20,They put way too much food on the table and we asked them to stop then because we all felt bad about not finishing it and throwing it then away but they wouldn‚Äòt accept it gave us more and more and we always send it back. We did not really like the food as well. We‚Äòve had better Mezze‚Äòs in the past. Really disappointing!,Zanettos
40,"A typical taverna environment with a rich menu and quality food. A cosy place with friendly service and smiling people, whether customers or staff. Recommended for those who want to eat well and to eat a lot!",Zanettos
50,"Great variety of Cypriot cuisine meze type . Very delicious food , good service and traditional set up",Zanettos
50,A well known place situated in the old city of Nicosia with very good traditional food. A place that I always propose to my foreign friends and be sure that they will certainly appreciate my recommendation.,Zanettos
50,Local friends in Nicosia took us to this restaurant which has been operating for years I think I counted about 30 dishes which were delicious. Bookings are advised as it is very popular,Zanettos
50,"A friend who is Cypriot recommended Zanettos for dinner on a recent trip to Nicosia and we were certainly well advised.It took a little finding and from the outside is certainly very unassuming and without the recommendation we might have just passed it by.Once inside the welcome was warm and the food offering explained. There is no menu, just a set meal but the food just keeps on coming and coming and coming. The dishes are varied and represent traditional Cypriot cooking. I didn't count but afterwards we decided we had been offered in excess of twenty dishes, all delicious and interesting and so good in terms of cooking and quality that we were struggling to eat them all but couldn't resist them.The pricing for food quality, quantity and standard of service was at the low end of expectation.I recommend this place without reservation but maybe skip lunch on the day you plan to go, we skipped breakfast and lunch the following day too!",Zanettos
50,"This is a Cypriot Meze restaurant, and a very good one at that! The food is extremely generous: very large variety. Dishes just keep coming. The atmosphere is very nice. One of the oldest Tavernas in Central Nicosia. It has character!",Zanettos
50,Nice place to go with family or friends or even colleagues. The food is just great and the quantity just right.,Zanettos
50,everything are perfect excellent food and service. better go there with empty stomach :) very nice quality of the food I very good price,Zanettos
50,This restaurant is located in the old part of Nicosia. Great meat Meze. Prepare yourself to eat a lot!,Zanettos
40,One of the best places in old nicosia town to eat cyprus meze Traditional environment and plenty of cyprus dishes to taste,Zanettos
50,"If you want to enjoy meze go to Zanettos restaurant, in the old part of the city Nicosia. The street in front of the restaurant sais nothing what you can expect inside. The more positive view was inside where you can see a lot of tables. We came relatively early in the evening and we can choose our table on the open air. When leaving - the restaurant was full of guests. We didn't count the number of the courses but I think it was more than 15 fort the price 25 EUR each. The dishes were very tasty and we had enjoyed our dinner here.Josef Koc, Czech republic",Zanettos
50,"Zanettos offers a fixed meze menu with too many courses to count. My wife and I went as a couple, and they brought us enough food for easily 4 people. Pace yourself to enjoy all of the flavors, and don't feel guilty not finishing the early plates! Otherwise you won't have room for the later dishes. Some excellent and unusual items were included that we didn't see other meze places. My favorite of those were the snails served in shell.",Zanettos
40,"In nowdays it is dificult to find good Cyprian food in Nicosia. Even is located in the old city does not have "" tourist food "". In my opinion the quality is very good, all the plates are very taste and the price are very reasonable. For sure I will be visit it again.",Zanettos
40,"This is a truly remarkable place. As the friendly owner explains, there is no real menu. They just bring you a variety of local dishes, many of them quite tasty. What makes it exceptional is the extraordinary quantity being offered. Most travellers are familiar with the formula that you pay a fixed sum and may eat as much as you want. In this case they continue bringing it to your table until you firmly tell them to stop. The price would be very reasonable even if the dishes came in standard quantity.",Zanettos
50,"A loud, friendly and interesting place to eat. We were a couple but I would still recommend it. No menu; the food just starts arriving and keeps arriving until you ask them to stop. We loved it",Zanettos
50,"This restaurant offers excellent meze, friendly service and a relaxed vibe. It is one of the best places in Nicosia serving local dishes.",Zanettos
50,"Went on a Friday night at 9.30 pm which is early as we were the first ones there. It's in the old part of Nicosia and it's got the old feel to it which is great. Owner met & greeted us and ensured we were looked after the whole night, typical Cypriot hospitality. Seating seemed a bit tight but added to the cosiness. Wall are covered with pictures of celebrities that have visited which shows what a great landmark this place is.Food is mainly mezedes which comes in big volumes and tastes very traditional so go hungry.Will definitely visit again",Zanettos
50,"It would be easy to pass by this place and miss it, with its little entrance door... and that would be a mistake. This place serves delicious local dishes one after the other, continuously, and in abundance, until you are so full that you give up. Very friendly service staff. Get a table in the rear courtyard in summer for an even better experience.",Zanettos
50,"A difficult place to find, but the locals all seem to swear by it, and for good reason. The only choice is meze, and they keep on bringing entirely too much food. I was there with two others, and we would have needed at least another three more to have any chance to finish everything. They bring everything from a gigantic Greek salad, to fried zucchini, to snails, to liver, to sausages, to chicken and pork souvlaki, to all sorts of other dishes. Each is delicious, and you feel bad that you're not finishing everything, but as soon as the Greek salad shows up (right at the beginning), you know that you shouldn't even try. I'm told that you'll generally need a reservation (we went on a Monday night and it was pretty full). Pretty sure I won't have to eat tomorrow until dinner, and yet dinner and a half pint bottle of zivania was a bit over 27 Euro per person.",Zanettos
50,"I dined with a buisiness associate who is Greek Large place, very warm attmosohere Good vegeterian options The amount of food we were served was incredible. We had to leave two thirs of it on the table",Zanettos
50,"We reserved a table of 5 earlier that day. It was a Thursday so we didn't expected it to be that busy. I have to say the meze there isn't the cheapest on the island priced at 21‚Ç¨, but it is MORE THAN WORTH IT! If you happen to be in the island either visiting or whatever, you have to take the opportunity and go to Zanettos. It has a unique style that really reflects the Cypriot hospitality. Food had very good taste and the drinks range from wine to beer to spirits. The food just keeps coming, not to mention the sweets ranging from cypriot sweets like syruped walnuts to lebanese mahalepi. I will defenately visit again!!",Zanettos
50,"My visit to Zanettos came as a suggestion from a friend and it was the best recommendation that I have had in a long time. Zanettos is a traditional Cypriot serving a huge range of 26 Meze dishes to the table that are guaranteed to make you leave full and satisfied.I was greeted well by staff that spoke good English and despite being rather busy they attended the table to ensure that nothing more could be done to make the visit worthwhile. Personally I couldn't eat everything but was not disappointed as there was so much food - the desert came as a surprise that I hadn't accounted for but I managed to eatVisit this place no matter what you are in Nicosia for, whether you are alone, with work colleagues or with family and friends. Proper Cypriot food in a relaxed and traditional the restaurant - at a great price",Zanettos
50,"We happily managed to secure a table without a reservation and were warmly welcomed by the host/owner. As stated below the menu is fixed consisting of circa 20 generous dishes so if you didn't like one or two there really is no great loss. Personally I liked them all! The house wine was delicious as well. The price was very reasonable for such an experience and I would love to go back again. But will book next time! Oh and allow a lot of time the is an experience to linger over and relish, best eaten slowly :-)",Zanettos
50,"I was fortunate to be part of a group of about 20 who were booked into Zanettos in early March 2018 for an evening dinner - more accurately described as a feast. Course after course arrived, delicious Cypriot food, washed down with beer, wine and local version of raki. Totally stuffed and well-watered, don‚Äôt arrive having already had a snack.Staff were welcoming, the atmosphere rustic but that‚Äôs part of the charm. It‚Äôs not an elegant place for fine dining in a tuxedo but the best meal I‚Äôve had so far when visiting Cyprus. Very much recommended.",Zanettos
50,A very traditional Cypriot experience. Fixed menu of 20 different dishes. Very friendly staff. value for money. They bring out dessert and fruit at the end. Really a lot of food so better go hungry.,Zanettos
40,If you are in group you cannot miss the meze in Zanettos restaurant. It is an experience everybody must do once in a life :),Zanettos
50,Serious eating but you have to be prepared! Go only if you are hungry as the choice and quantity are over any limits. The place is excellent - food is unbelievable with great cypriot kitchen and the staff is so friendly and nice. Highly recommended for people that can handle a significant dinner.,Zanettos
40,"Ok you want an authentic Cypriot meal experience and you like meat (repeat like meat) then you have to come here.Tavern is full everyday and the rich and famous Cypriots and non Cypriots come here.The owner is hands on and his team are friendly.The food was authentic, tasted great and oh my they are generous.If you want a quiet restaurant then this isn‚Äôt your place and if you want vegetarian yes they have a lot of options but this isn‚Äôt why they are famous.We had a meze and even though were 5 of us it could have served 10 easily.It‚Äôs great for groups up to 10 may struggle beyond that but who knows.",Zanettos
50,"10 of us decided to go back for another visit to see if we could get any closer to actually finishing the food laid out in front of us.We had starved ourselves that day and approached the task full of excitement and trepidation.Yet again we were taken down by the vast amounts of delicious local food. Even our hostess told us not to eat the bread before walking away laughing.We tried and failed again so that means we just need to keep going back.If you are hungry this place is a must. Great place, staff, food and drink.",Zanettos
50,"Zanettos Tavern has been around for almost 8 decades (meaning something must be going right in the kitchen)The flavours which come out of the kitchen are all equivalent to the aromas which follow before it. It is a busy establishment with hardly any vacancies for ‚Äúwalk-ins‚Äù so a reservation is always a proper way to create your first experience. The prices are properly sufficient to the quantity of food it supplies. In fact SO much food follows (when you order the ‚Äúmeze‚Äù option) that most people are usually stuffed from the starters alone! I‚Äôve heard people, and seen it with my own eyes, requesting to stop bringing the food because they cannot eat anymore.",Zanettos
40,"Large range of meze.Food is very good.Not representative of the Cypriot nor the Greek cuisine. It walks the line between the two cuisines. Touches, colours, tastes and smells of both.Clean establishment.Neither cheap nor expensive.Extremely crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.Don't risk going without a reservation.",Zanettos
50,"Amazing place, where you can enjoy every type of Cyprus food in portions (called ""mezedes"").. Great food and dessert options..",Zanettos
50,"If you visit Zanettos, it's hardly by chance. Most likely you have read about it, and you are willing to accept their ""meze overkill"" challenge.Eating here feels like going on a journey through the cypriot cuisine, from the starters to the dessert. Just like any other travel, there will be moments to treasure, moments that you will forget and moments when you'll feel that you just can't possibly go on.The service is friendly and the place is pleasant (but we visited it during the low season). Our journey was rewarding and definitely low-cost. An experience you will tell about once you are back to your country.",Zanettos
50,A great way to experience a variety of Cypriot dishes. Very large portions and very tasty. Seems like reservations are needed at least on the weekends. I was able to get within without a reservation by going early and promising not to take too long. Make sure to save room for dessert!,Zanettos
50,"The owner told us right away that there is no menu and no optionsJust an endless stream of small to medium platesThe variety is so big that anyone can find plenty to eat even if you are not crazy about snails :)Not a good place for vegetarians as many of the dishes are various types of meat.Although we didn't see a menu or knew the price , the bill was very reasonableCome hungry and take your time",Zanettos
40,"The restaurant is extremely popular judging by the number of people in there the night I went. The place was packed. We had the set Meze. The food was very good and I lost count of the number of dishes served, they just kept coming. We all had our fll and there was plenty left when we had finished. Staff were fine, pleasant.",Zanettos
10,Quantity but not quality. The owner is very rude same as his employees. The food is bad and the place is loud. Avoid!,Zanettos
50,"food was great,atmosphere excellent,staff very friendly.plates for Cypriot meze were huge but very good.got to be very hungry.",Zanettos
40,"Our business partners invited us to Zanettos to experience some traditional cousine.All the food we got on the table was very good and particular, the final quantity was unbelieveable. In 4 we could barely eat half of what we got.The food is very good, the service is excellent. Its a busy and noisy restaurant so if you want to have some quiet time this is not the place to be.Overall amazin experience, the owner of the restaurant is a great person. Only comment is that the chairs are not too comfortable.Highly reccomend!",Zanettos
50,"Usually, a lot of people are commenting on a restaurant that his quantity is not good but the quality is great, Or that its quantity is big but the quality is low.Well thankfully in Zanettos, The quality is Fantastic and the quantity is more than enough.The owner is very friendly and funny, the service is very fast and helpful as they explain what each dish is.The location is great because it's not near a busy street and the atmosphere of the tavern is so cozy and it's like you are at a home family dinner.For sure try the sweets that come at the end.",Zanettos
40,"Nice tastes, but be prepared that the number of dishes served is very high, and this is the standard no need to order anything specifically. So better have time to digest after!",Zanettos
40,i have been going to Zanettos Restaurant/Tavern for many years. Great food Reasonable prices great atmosphere one of my favourites in Nicosia,Zanettos
40,"Nice cozy place. Good food, good & friendly service & value for money. The wines are kept a a very reasonable price, that is a big plus.",Zanettos
50,"Picturesque but authentic restoring where you must do nothing but sitting, waiting for the courses and... eat in the typical ""meze"" style! The most of the courses are delicious. Only one upsetting surprise: the œáœâœÅŒπŒ¨œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑ (the Greek salad) in Cyprus don't foresee onions! Unbelievable",Zanettos
50,"We wandered in not knowing anything about Zanettos and we‚Äôre instantly captivated by the charm and hospitality. Then the food came. It was the best Mediterranean meal I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of experiencing, and for an astoundingly low price.",Zanettos
40,"Good food but the meze is expensive. The staff was very friendly, the owner is very friendly and makes you feel welcome. The service was very good. The food was tasty.",Zanettos
10,"The positiveA. the atmosphereB. the ownerC. the decorationThe negativeA. The policy that everybody who is there gets to eat and pay.B. The foodAnalysisThe Positive:The setting is very nice, in the old town, inside the walls, usually full house, with a very welcoming owner and nice decoration that reminds more of an Athenian tavern than a Cypriot one. Photos of the owner with famous people who ate there is the main decoration theme.The Negative:A. The policy that everybody who sits there has to get the meze for 21 euro, even if they don't feel like eating an ox. The result of that is that you end up with food for 2 more days to be taken with you back home.B. The food is average to below average for a restaurant and I will go to all items one by one. Photos are provided for everything I mention here.1. Salat is pre-cut and the vegetables are not in prime condition. Tomatoes for example lost their texture and there were only good for stew. 3/102. Toasted bread with herbs and olive oil was nice and fresh. 7/103. Yoghurt was of a good quality 8/104. Beetroots were as expected plain probably bought in a container. 6/105. Skordalia had a very bad texture. The potatoes were not fully mashed and some of them were not fully cooked. It is an easy dish and there are no excuses for making it like that. Also there was a lot of water in it for the amount of potatoes and garlic. 3/106. Pitta bread was the average supermarket quality lightly toasted. Nothing special 6/107. Toasted Halloumi was again from the average quality you can buy from the supermarket cheap made from cow and powder milk. Cooked ok 5/108. The sausage was not the village type with red local wine and herbs. Mass production stuff from one of the main factories in Cyprus cooked on charcoal. 5/109. Ribs in wine. Now that was precooked and served to us after heated. All juices were out and if it wasn't for the fat, the thing would have been totally dry. It felt like I was eating yesterday‚Äôs food. 3/1010. Fried liver. Again pre-fried and reheated with no succulent juices. Texture was dry and almost cold inside. 3/1011. Spanakorizo (spinach risotto). Same mistake again here with precooked stuff. the rice got very soft and gluey due to overcooking and then getting cold and heated up again. Too much oil in it made it really very greasy. 2/1012. Mushroms were the cheap type button mushrooms grilled with oil. Again nothing to call home about 4/1013. The chips were probably the best dish. Double fried (I think by the same policy of the rest of the food), from real potatoes and cooked to be crispy. 8/1014. Seftialies. Now this was again below average. From frozen and factory made with not prime meat with addives. 3/1015. Souvlakia. From pork leg with a lot of big fatty pieces. Half dry from juices half fatty pieces. This is the cheapest part of the pork you can buy and it is not good for fast cooking like you have in souvlaki. You need bacon and neck meat to do them properly. 4/1016. Baked potatoes were not baked fully. Army food. 3/1017. Chicken souvlaki. From frozen chicken meat with a marinate to substitute for the lack of texture . Looks ok from the outside but inside is dry, dry, dry and takes time to chew it. 3/1018. Ox liver. Again the same mistake as the first liver. No point to have 2 liver dishes in the menu cooked in the same way. Liver needs to be served as ‚Äúresting‚Äù otherwise it gets dry very fast. 3/1019. Fried courgette strips. This was freshly floured and fried. No salt to taste though. Nice touch. 7/1020. Ravioli. When you cook ravioli and you leave it in the water to wait 3-4 hours before you serve it, the dough becomes too soft and sticky. Factory made ravioli again from supermarket, boiled hours ago and re heated with the inside colder than the outside. 3/1021. Snails. This is supposed to be the jewel in the crown. Well is not. Overcooked hours ago in sauce and reheated. The fatty sauce has not melted with reheating and you could find lard and cold fat inside the snail! The overcooking in the sauce made the meat to loose its texture and become one taste with the sauce. Snails need a good chef. 3/1022. Pourgouri (pilaf). Cooked beforehand and left to dry without its juices. Not fully cooked and without its proper amount of moisture made this stuff difficult to eat. 3/1023. Eggs with tomatoes!! What a disaster! The worst kind! Like scramble eggs gone bad and poured over with tomato sauce. Uneatable. 1/1023. Lebanese machalepi was made there and was with real nice pistachios. The cream though was not made from real ingredients but bought as a powder. 6/1024. Sweets karidaki kitromilo. A bit dry, the cheap mass production you get from a factory. 4/1025. Halvas was nice with nuts in it and cinnamon, well cooked. Probably the best out of the lot. 7/1026. Fruits were imported apples and pears with two pieces of melon. The cheapest fruits in the market today. They could do better than that.We ended up eating very little of what they brought. I wish the quality of the cooking was better and the quantity less.I also have to mention that all food had very little salt and you had to adjust it. That is not good for cooking as this is a tavern and you have to know how to use salt while cooking. This is not a hospital. If someone needs less salt he can ask the cook especially to do it for him. Yet this is a problem when 90% of the menu is precooked.The place needs a chef who can cook and needs to upgrade its ingredients policy to stand up to its name. Cheap ingredients and non professional chefs don‚Äôt make a good restaurant however nice the setting is and sociable the owner.The service was fast but too fast for meze! Everything was on the table getting coldER without having space to move or time to enjoy it. Meze is to be served at a nice slow pace and not to be force fed.I would have given it 2 stars for the food but as the meze costs ‚Ç¨21 per head and a can of coke or a litre of water is ‚Ç¨2.5 it gets just one.",Zanettos
40,"Really great food, great service and they are very accommodating regarding dietary requirements.The only point missed would be that you cant order for fewer people since the quantities are so much, you can take away some of the food, but there is still food that goes to waste..i.e. gets thrown away, which is a pity.Besides this, 100% on overall, environment is buzzing, love the thought behind the d√©cor and the traditional treat at the end is always welcomed",Zanettos
50,"This place worth a visit. You start by washing your hands with aromatic water and then you get the fixed menu. And plates come. And come. And come. Make sure you leave enough space to taste everything! Great place, tasty food, friendly staff!",Zanettos
40,"Dining in Zanettos is a real feast! Meze includes all the popular local dishes, in really generous portions! Food is delicious, ambience is cosy and service is normally efficient.",Zanettos
40,one of the more traditional tavernas in nicosia. located in the old city offers great variety of food and excellent service,Zanettos
50,Is the best place to go evritheng is great and fresh and the praise is good the problem is the parking place is peter take TAXI,Zanettos
50,"Felt great not just eating their great menu but also experiencing the staff 's excellent service skills and the skills of amazing owner. Will be back, totally recommended!",Zanettos
40,"A very friendly place, offering a very good quality cypriot meze. Mostly meat, although the selection includes a few vegetable offerings as well. As customary, good quality is accompanied by generous quantity.... Skip lunch if you plan to go there for dinner !!",Zanettos
40,"When you see it from the outside, all you can see is the name ""Zanettos"", and it looks as if you're walking into a wall. When you go in, you find yourself in a small room, with cups, and cutlery, and wine, you open the door and enter the restaurant, that just keeps unfolding itself and keeps getting bigger and bigger. We sat down in a seat in the corner of the main room (there was another room behind a glass window as well); The decoration around was very ethnic, the walls slightly old and covered with pictures and photographs. The waitress was quite friendly, but when we asked her for the menu or what was available, she said ""no, no there is no menu, the menu's on us"", or something like that. Usually ""mezes"" in Greece means small nibbles of food, but you still get to choose. Not here... She did ask us what we wanted to drink though, and we got two KEOS beers, and a KEOS orangeade (KEOS is the local brand of beer in Cyprus). Small starters came first, including olives, beetroot, small green salad with cheese, greek salad, vinegar, oil, to add, our drinks, toasted bread with oil and oregano, a jar of yoghurt.. Not to mention that the place-mates were wonderful, amazing design, and the plates had the restaurant's logo on it too; so cute! Anyway, and then the main-er courses came: sausages, haloumi cheese, lamb chops, naan bread, fried vegetables (courgettes, carrot...), liver, rice with spinach, chips, snails, pork chops, potatoes, and many more. And all these, about two at a time, every about 7 minutes. The food was absolutely lovely, divine flavour, extremely ethnic. I LOVED the food. But it was just too much. The plates didn't even fit on the table, by the time they'd brought everything. And we had eaten lots of the first stuff, because we didn't know there was going to be more coming. So we weren't hungry for the new things later on that hadn't even come yet. We tried to stop the waitress from bringing us more food, but she wouldn‚Äôt listen to us, and said there was more to come. In the end, it was really too much, and it ended up being a complete waste of food. It would have been really nice, if we weren‚Äôt staying in a hotel, and then we could've taken everything home with us, and had it later, instead of leaving it there. Wonderful taste, and experience, but a total waste. There were three of us.. Maybe one should've gone and ordered and then the others could join in.. But three definitely couldn't have eaten all that. Finally, we got to pudding, and we were completely stuffed by then.. Even the dessert was tons, and full of variety: fresh fruit, yoghurt for all of us, and halvas (traditional sweet)! Although the wipe design was very nice... All in all it was a bargain for what we got. It was 73,5 for tons of food for three people. And it came with sweeties...! At the end, I asked them for a place-mat, because the design was so wonderful, and they gave me about 30! I only wanted one...But they were very generous, and all in a very good mood, as, when we left, the chef was dancing to Greek music! And he posed for a photograph... ;) We would go again, but prepared next time! A restaurant definitely not to miss... but beware",Zanettos
50,Probably the best cyprus tavern with great plates of mezedes. Beautifull atmoshere and very good service!,Zanettos
50,"We had the good fortune, after a few months of living in Cyprus, of eating at Zanetto's. Meze (a spread) is not for the fully health-conscious but we heard from the owner (the place rated a Chef's Restaurant, i.e., one which other international chefs learn from) that, having learned in New York, he ensures every item is the freshest and best, and the food tasted that way. As with all meze, but more than most, the food was super-abundant, but in this case, as we don't eat pork, we were allowed to pick and choose (e.g., no snails, no pork, only chicken) and were really impressed with the kindness and flexibility of the staff. Most Cypriots dine late, but we were happy to come right as Zanetto's opened and be the only ones in the place, circa 6:30 or so, I believe. The zucchini fries were amazing, and the general authentic ambience - it is really the oldest, longest-running business in the country - testified to the new nephew's drive to keep what was amazing about the tradition while ensuring that the produce was fresh from the market and leftovers were never used. You can see why other star-quality international chefs might treasure a visit to Zanetto's; we did, and anyone who enjoys meze (know that, with kids, you don't have to get a full meze) will love the place. A bit pricier than other places but for what you get (we ended up making four meals out of the leftovers!) it is quite worth it, abundant, fresh, delicious, and authentic.",Zanettos
40,Great many options. Great range of dishes. Well prepared. Sufficient service. Overcrouded. Bit expensive. Clean.,Zanettos
50,Im going there at least 10 years and I have nothing but good to say about this friendly well known tavern. Great food with lots and lots of different dishes. The service is amazing and very friendly.,Zanettos
40,Not your typical tavern. I ve been to Zanettos a few times. Food is very good and portions are massive. Service is fast and the prices are ok. There is a huge variety of dishes. It works on the basis of fix menu per person and you can taste many different dishes from kebab to snails (karaolous).Be prepared to eat a lot. The dishes are coming to the table non stop and if you are enjoying tasting different plates you will enjoy a visit at Zanetos.,Zanettos
50,"The place is a cozy restaurant with friendly atmosphere and a lovely staff. It has been my first meze and I'm still impressed, not only because there were so many typical dishes from Cyprus but also they were delicious. If you wanna try the real taste from Cyprus, without any doubt I would recommend Zanettos :)",Zanettos
50,"Traditional greek meze food coming in large portions. Enjoyed everything about it. The food, the atmosphere, the staff. A place worth visiting.",Zanettos
50,"Zannetos tavern is a must in the district of Nicosia. If you want to taste cypriot heaven food, you should visit this paradise! Delicious traditional meze , excellent suvlaki and especially very good service! No words to describe the mouthwatering dessert!",Zanettos
40,it was great experience - one of the past that i used to visit the tavern when it was still a magirion - little local restaurant,Zanettos
30,Usual Cypriot meze with loads of food including the grill. Noisy for business dinner but if your out with friends then it's rather good. Shall continue going.,Zanettos
50,"All the other reviews say it - fantastic kebabs, liver, snails, beetroot salad, etc. Too much to eat but perfect meze. Tell your host that you like something, and they'll bring you more and more!Recommended to me by the Front of House Manager at the Hilton Park hotel. A must for anyone looking for authentic Cyprus meze!",Zanettos
50,"THE place for meze. The variety and amount of food overwhelming. Although not all dishes were to our taste, most of them were delicious!Priced at 21 euro per person and with the atmosphere and friendly service, it is a great deal that will leave you satisfied and your belly full.",Zanettos
50,"We just came from Athens and stopping over in Cyprus for 2 nights. Our friend who lives here took us to this restaurant, a typical Cypriot Meze. My oh my, was that a feast fit for a king. For 20 some Euros per person, you are treated to everything, I mean everything. I don't even know how to describe it. I have had something like this in Lebanon before. I guess this is how some Mediterranean people treat themselves. Among the first course, I loved the Beets salad and whatever the shredded green salad that was in a small cup. Could it be Dandelion Greens? Don't eat any bread if you plan to try everything that comes out of the kitchen. Pork belly was really good if you can eat the pork fat. Liver was well seasoned and grilled. Grilled Halloumi Cheese was great. The sausage is very strong. It's different from any sausages I've had in the US. I think it's similar to the Lebanese Sausages. Next, Fried Cauliflower and Zucchini. With lots of squeezed lemon, they were delicious. Grilled portabella mushrooms and green rice? They are good, but I think their presence was overshadowed by the next item: Grilled Meat Platter. Pork, Chicken, more Sausages, this was tender than the last sausages. I like the latter. I would like to know how they season the Chicken and Pork and grill to that perfection. My friend who lives there told me that they have a special oven. OK, can I at least know what seasoning they use? Maybe next time. So even french fries or thick steak fries were good. The side dishes were Rice, Scrambled Eggs-Cypriot Style, and Ravioli. Lastly, we got snails. Wow, the last time I had snails was in Portugal. These ones are little bigger, maybe escargot size. When my daughter pulled the meat out, it bounced around and made her think it was alive. She had to stab it several times to ""kill it"" just to make sure before she put a small piece into her mouth. Wow, what an experience. I love it. So, if you are in Cyprus one day, come to Zanettos. You won't regret it.",Zanettos
40,"Zanettos is a cultural icon , serving the traditional meze in Nicosia for decades. Food is descent and the atmosphere will take you back in the 60's. Usually crowded, reasonable prices, more food one can possibly take.",Zanettos
40,"The amount of delicious food that comes with the meze is amazing. The food is delicious but the quantity is overwhelming. I couldn't help feeling guilty about what we couldn't eat - it seemed wasteful. So when ordering, order for half the number of folks at your table and then enjoy it all!",Zanettos
50,"Still the best taverna in Nicosia (operating as a family business since 1938), regarding quality, variety and quantity of the mezedes! The colourful owner is the first to welcome you and all the staff are exceedingly friendly, helpful and efficient! Its always a pleasure to visit and sample the big variety of cypriot dishes and desserts!",Zanettos
50,Zanettos in the heart of the old city is a traditional cypriot restaurant with first class meze. Excellent food and great portions can satisfy even the most difficult customer. Dont expect luxurious surroundings but service and food is top.,Zanettos
50,Great off the beaten path restaurant that serves authentic Cyprus dishes. We came at 6:30 p.m. midweek and were the first customers.It was a very relaxing atmosphere with very friendly service. As far as choice of meal we were told that we had no choice but meat meze (a variety of different sample dishes). We agreed and didn't regret. It was delicious and plentiful. Took half of it home.Verdict: great family restaurant that operates from 1938 in a quiet setting of old town that is definitely worth visiting if you would like to try authentic Cyprus dishes.,Zanettos
50,"Traditional Cypriot tavern serving meze (variety of delicious meat and veg dishes). Come here a lot and have never left disappointed. Always plenty of good food. Excellent service, staff and owner very friendly.",Zanettos
40,"Been here for decades, no menu, just loads of Meze dishes. Lovely staff and the owner is usually around too. Food nice but not posh cuisine! Noticeable how many locals especially families eat here.It wasn't busy the night we went, but there are a lot of tables and it is probably very noisy when full.It felt very authentic and the value was great.",Zanettos
50,"They were only serving meze when we visited so we gave it a try. It turned into a bit of a marathon, despite warnings from the very helpful and friendly staff at the first 6 dishes being delivered that there was lot to come. When we got around the 15th we were starting to struggle but with a bit of determination made it through to the 24th-ish - we had lost count by the time the fruit arrived - so as not to let the side down. Dishes ranged from delicious yogurt, through excellent beetroot, varied well cooked meats and snails - which I admit we declined - and included a sooooo strong beef liver it shouldn't be let out alone. The food was overall excellent and all served in a old-style canteen environment which adds to the charm and by excellent staff.Drinks were good too, and the reasonable price didn't reflect how much, and how good, the food was. I'd certainly recommend a visit, but just not two consecutive nights if you are having the meze.",Zanettos
40,They really serve you lots of food. Some dishes are very good some are just ok. The price is fixed per person so either you eat it or not the will serve you. It is a nice experience to visit Zanettos.,Zanettos
30,"Nice atmosphere with good food. Although it became very popular for more than a decade, the food quality remains quite stable. Too much competition though. The location is not bad at all but there are many taverns with perfect locations. It could offer something special to make people remember it and feel happy to recommend it.",Zanettos
40,People that would like to try Cypriot cuisine and seem not to be able to find everything in the same place should try this restaurant. Its been going on for years but the quality and service always seems to be of the highest quality in town,Zanettos
30,"Impressive meze menu, with countless colourful dishes. Taste is ok, atsmosphere fine, and prices affordable. Go for it for the Cypriot experience.",Zanettos
40,Classic cypriot tavern with traditional cypriot cuisine! Big portions good prices very suitable for a night out with friends family or collegues! Nice selection of wines!,Zanettos
40,"Although we had some trouble finding the restaurant - its tucked away in one of the back streets, quite far from the main road of Nicosia - we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. The restaurant was packed, plenty of locals, which we took as a good sign. We were served several meze - ranging from greek salad to cypriot sausage, beetroot salad, pork, chicken dishes, fried potatoes etc... one word of caution, PACE YOURSELF, take your time to savour all the dishes! The portions are quite generous, and the food was pretty good, the staff were friendly and the place had a cosy setting. The proprietor even came round the tables to check that everything was to our satisfaction, which was nice!",Zanettos
20,"Food waist.... you must eat what they want, not you ordering menu! Traditional Cyprus cuisine - meze style. Excellent for meat lovers and VERY HUNGRY PEOPLE....",Zanettos
50,"Excellent service, big variety of traditional dishes, no need to worry about what to order, they just lay it on the table and its delicious. I have counted approx 18 different dishes on the table. Did have a great time.",Zanettos
40,"Ridiculous amounts of food... An almost never ending array of meze dishes (its fixed) for the full cyprus experience... The space is also quirky and an experience in itself... Make note of the wall of celebrities and see how many you can spot, politicians and musicians/performers... Price medium to high for meze but always of garanteed good quality. Do book ahead especially on weekends!",Zanettos
40,An excellent service with very good food based on Cyprus traditional food. It is a memorable supper experience.,Zanettos
40,"Great restaurant in the old town. We had a mezze here after being recommended by a colleague. I have never eaten so much food, and have had many mezzes before. Some of the dishes like snails I didn't like. But the wild pig sausages were great. Chicken was super tasty. Such a fun evening out :)",Zanettos
10,"I can't imagine what other people have written. There mut be two restaurants with the same name!! Apart from the service, there is really nothing to compliment in the whole experience,.",Zanettos
40,"Meze restaurant - Greek/Cypriot kind of tapas bar. It is much bigger than it appears from the street.You cannot order, but just sit and enjoy the show. Every 10 minutes you are served with few small dishes, so you end up with full table and (more than full) stomach. Dinner for two with drinks was 56eur.So, if you would like to visit something traditional and you enjoy Greek/Turkish/Cypriot food - great place to be.",Zanettos
40,"Located in the old city, very friendly owner, good service, you don't have order anything, they just bring and bring and bring you Cypriot specialities until the moment you say ""please no more"". Excellent price level.",Zanettos
50,I've been going to Zanettos for years and the place only gets better with time. Way too much food buys that's OK because it's all delicious. Great traditional atmosphere and hospitality. The type of place one should take visitors to Nicosia.,Zanettos
40,I have always been a fun of Cypriot Traditional Cuisine! I find the restaurant to be very good with a vastly and pure traditional recipes! Great ambience!,Zanettos
50,"We're been going here for over 5 years and the quality is consistent. Proper thin Base pizza and the nochi is superb. Good for veggies. Lovely outdoor seating in a busy pedestrian street so no car fumes, just good people watching and shopping after.",Zanettos
50,Nicosia used to have a dozen world class taverns....where the owners were as much part of the experience as the meze....One of the few still standing is the excellent Zanettos where you will feast like medieval majesty....You will love it,Zanettos
50,"I have been there with my friends and all of them loved the foods, ambiance and the stuff as well. The foods were simply amazing, Do not hesitate to eat here.",Zanettos
50,"Located in the old city of Nicosia, can be easily missed as the entrance is very modest. When entering, a big traditional place revealed.Come VERY VERY hungry to the place!The owner of the place also serves the customers, is very polite and a very good person. Always nice and reluctant to help.Personally, the Meze is amazing by itself, but the star dish of the Meze is the Shiftalia - by FAR the best shiftalia in Nicosia!",Zanettos
50,This is a traditional Cyprus Tavern and serves only meze. Prices are a bit high but worth every single cent you will spend. The host is fully professional and the service is excellent. Meze consists of about 15-20 dishes aweets and coffee. The best place in the old city of Nicosia for local cuisine!,Zanettos
50,Service was friendly !!! Music and atmosphere great !!! Food delicious !!! Very law price !! Pay 21 euro and eat a loooooooooooooooooot !!!!!!! Definitely back and highly recommend !!!,Zanettos
50,Zanettos is one of the best places I ever been in Nicosia. Excellent food quality and quantity and the customer service is very friendly and helpful.,Zanettos
50,"If you believe that eatings makes happy, you have to visit this amazing good restaurant""zanettos"" Only one good advice: don't eat something two days before",Zanettos
50,"Friendly staff, abundant food, very delicious, traditional cuisine, nice setup, I recommend this place to everybody around",Zanettos
50,Great mediterranean food full of influences. Good price and flavours. Perfect to taste the essence of the island.,Zanettos
40,"We went there after a taxi driver suggestion!!!!You pay 21,00‚Ç¨ per person and they serve a lot and deferent type of ""meze"".Food is good and for shure you will not leave the place hungry!!!!!!Decor is like an old Cypriot tavern.Nice atmosphere.Friendly staff.",Zanettos
30,We visited this tavern with a group of friends visiting Cyprus from abroad. Good staff and approach from the owner . Only negative they bring too much food at the same time on the table that doesn't give you a chance to breath,Zanettos
50,"If you want to have a huge amount of food and spend all night with friends, this is the place to go. They take no orders, so you have to be ready to take as much food as you can.The only recommendation is to arrive hungry to the place.",Zanettos
20,"It is an overestimated restaurant which at the begging, when opens, offer good food, the service was very good and the atmosphere was proper for every kind of visit (family, friend, etc). I believe, today the Zanettos restaurant does not offer me all these that offer me at the past.",Zanettos
50,"so many different dishes, I loved them all, but highlights were the beetroot, sausages, crystalised fruit, sweet pickled walnuts. I can't believe how much we ate. We couldn't even nibble at the last dishes. We had a couple of bottles of excellent Cyprus wine [12 euros a bottle]. What an experience! Will go back on our last night here to leave with a really good meal. Service was quick, cheerful, helpful. Very full, get there early! Difficult to find as front is very small, but sign sticks out, and the road name is right.",Zanettos
30,"Nice traditional taverna in the heart of the city. Not bad at all, friendly waitresses and owner, however it took forever to bring the next dish and you lose your appetite because while you wait you finish all the salads and starters and there's not room for anything else when they bring the meat in the end.",Zanettos
50,"A 16 course meal, all mezes topped with some Raki, wine and a considerate chef make this an experience to be had in Nicosia.",Zanettos
50,"We are amazing food. And then, we are MORE amazing food. Then we are again. And again. And again. I honestly did not think the food would stop and it was all fabulous. If you are a tourist to Cyprus, please put this restaurant on your must do list. Highly recommended.",Zanettos
50,Best place for Meze in the Nicosia area! Very nice environment! The people are amazing! And excellent service!,Zanettos
50,"It was one of the greatest dinners I have ever experienced. In Cyprus, the free part, in Nicosia, there is a magical taverna called Zanettos. You just order meze, and they will bring you all of their tastes in small plates. Food is spectacular...authentic greek cypriot flavors..You just need to eat slowly...in order to have the appropriate space in your stomach to fit all...At the end we couldnt eat all, and they brought us a variety of desserts..We had a very nice inhouse wine, red, and we only paid 25-30 per person..its a must!",Zanettos
50,Outstanding selection of Cypriot food. And it just keeps coming. And all delicious. The portions are huge. The prices are reasonable. The service is excellent. This is a must go to place while in Nicosia.,Zanettos
50,The staff welcomed us with smile. We were told that we have no choice: we're going to eat meze! (21‚Ç¨ per person) it's 19 dishes + desserts. Not everything we liked but you can feel that it's great quality food. It's better you don't eat the whole day :-) because it's a lot of food (be careful with the salad at start - it's very good but there's a lot to come),Zanettos
30,You pay 21‚Ç¨ per person + drinks and you just get a lot of food that you cannot eat. The taste of the food is OK but still not worth the money. Would not go again. There were only tourists there.,Zanettos
50,"This must be by far the best place to experience traditional cuisine and Cyprus hospitality; from the welcoming with rose water to the coffee and desserts at the end. Not knowing what to order off the menu is an irrelevant concern at Zannetos, you order mezze and pay per person. A variety of dishes will start arriving at your table from salads, to home cooked dishes, fish and meat, followed by coffee and dessert (fresh fruit and/or traditional sweets). The atmosphere is warm and friendly, ideal for large groups (just make sure to make a reservation as it is often full).You can pair your meal with Cypriot wine or Zivania.Just make sure not to stuff your face with food early on, have a bite of everything and wait for the next courses to arrive... there will be a lot of food!",Zanettos
40,a small restaurant not for many but to much food This is the real cyprus meze The owner is a very nice person Offcourse it is better to go for lunch than dinner If you eat all that in the night you wont be able to sleep,Zanettos
50,Everything they offer is genuine and traditional. Just ask mezze and they start to bring the spectacle of Cypriot tastes. With a bottle of zivania you will feel the Orient.,Zanettos
40,Good traditional food. Cyprus tastes and friendly service. Both cypriots and tourist go there. It has good food and traditional atmosphere with signs of todays life not being able to be left behind.,Zanettos
40,"Be prepared for slightly above average, well presented and prepared 'meze' style serving (fixed menu/small dishes served in order/priced per person), that you will not be able to fully consume as it is a substantial amount. Pricewise, and according to the quantity served, I would say it is ok, although I would prefer the option of choosing my own dishes. Good natured owner, and fast moving staff.",Zanettos
50,Great food ... quantity and quality ... friendly attentive staff that want to ensure you enjoy your experiance .... a must visit at least once when in Nicosia,Zanettos
50,"Food comes in large, really large quantities, and excellent quality. As a matter of fact if you don't ask to stop it will keep coming! Relaxed, local tavern in the old city with beautiful ambience. Reminds you of how Mediterranean hospitality was and should be. Zanettos - the boss - is a character to remember and a pleasure to be with. Prices for a very complete dinner seem to be like a slice of pizza in time square.",Zanettos
20,"I do not find necessary to comment on food quality when a venue does not show the minimum respect and understanding to its clients. Booked a table for 10, one person could not make it. The management decided that as long as the reservation was for 10 to bring meze and charge for 10 despite the fact that we obviously ordered for 9. There are are plenty of good taverns in Nicosia - we will definitely not visit again!",Zanettos
50,"I was told for a long time by many friends to visit this restaurant and thankfully I did. My goodness!... there was such a big variety of meze. The problem is that you are already full and the waiter still brings more and more cypriot specialities! Among the best dishes, were the cyp Loukaniko (sausage), stifado snails, and the souvlaki. I highly recommend to everyone this lovely place to enjoy abundantly the cypriot food in reasonable prices. Also service is absolutely perfect!",Zanettos
50,"I asked to a local friend to go to a very traditional place in Nicosia. Here basically you order the drink and you have a loads of food. Everything extremely simple, but nice. Recommended for a large group as food is really a lot.",Zanettos
50,"Zanettos is a family taverna in the old town in Nicosia which has been serving the very best Cypriot mezze in since 1938. Everything positive the reviews say is true. The food is exceptionally good. Service tops. Cypriots dine late so we had the place to ourselves until 8.30 on a Friday night, when large family groups started to appear and soon the whole taverna was buzzing. Children are received well here, expected to eat what the grown-ups eat and seem to do so with gusto late into the evening.Each dish is prepared fresh daily including their own tahini, garlic paste, bread and olives. There is no choice on the menu: you get whatever is fresh and seasonal and so many dishes it is impossible to eat everything and you will feel guilty at how much food will be wasted. We were told it is traditional to eat salad first 'to help your digestion', that the excellent yoghurt provided 'goes with everything' and advised not to fill up on the home-made pitta bread too early or we would not be able to fit in the wonderful meat courses which come later, after several dips and vegetable dishes. The garlic chicken kebabs, grilled beef liver, pickled beetroot, and snails in shell were stand-out dishes amongst many excellent others. The limited number of local wines on offer were excellent and suited the food really well.Eating mezze at Zanettos is an essential experience for any visitor to Cyprus. Very highly recommended.",Zanettos
50,At this tavern you will get the most of Cypriot cuisine with great quality and at average prices. Also great environment both inside and outside the restaurant. The backyard is really nice on summer,Zanettos
50,If it's your first visit in Cyprus or you want to get the most of Cypriot cuisine with the highest quality this is the place to be! The stuff are always very welcoming and the service is always top! Whether you are coming here for business or with friends a good time is guaranteed. Just beware.. the food can be overwhelming so just try everything and always leave space for more because more is going to come!,Zanettos
50,"Great Cypriot taverna food (grills etc) - especially the mezzes which just keep coming! You're going to walk out of here very satisfied! Old restaurant in the old part of Nicosia. Has been around for years and has a reputation to match. Only indoor seating, packed in the evenings so book early. Reasonable prices.",Zanettos
50,"Too much food, maybe heavy food if you indulge in everything, but you would never know what the limits to Cypriot meze are, if you do not go to Zanettos at least once in your lifetime.",Zanettos
50,"Traditional style Cypriot meze tavern. Very good service, and a lot of good food. Highly recommended. Make sure you're really hungry so that you enjoy everything till the end.. No kidding..the plates keep coming and everything is delicious!",Zanettos
40,Definitely go to zanettos for cypriot meze! Many many dishes to try and for sure you will take half of them with you as you will not be able to eat them!!,Zanettos
50,"Nice little restaurant with traditional food.We've ordered those ŒúŒµŒ∂Œ≠ dishes which came with a superior quality.Nice to spend a few hours with friends drinhking and eating.... be sure you're well prepared to accomodate all that food. The last advise, leave some space for the deserts and local wine.",Zanettos
30,Nice place to have Cyprus meze! I prefer to go in winter to have pasturma and loukaniko. A place to go with family and friends. Good prices! Too noise because always crowded,Zanettos
50,"Don't let an unprepossessing exterior in a quiet street put you off. The welcome is friendly, the owners and staff obviously love what they do. No menu, just a set meze. Be prepared for a lot of delicious food to come your way. If you are going for dinner, you should have a light breakfast and nothing else all day. We lost count at about 17 dishes, and after the meze, then plates of fresh fruit and sweet white wine kept coming.And only ‚Ç¨21 per head for the meze. Outstanding food and dining experience.",Zanettos
50,Do not judge the entrance. Food is in the back. Never suprised so pleasant in my 60yrs life. Food will please you from the very first moment. Service was more than friendly,Zanettos
40,"This is one of the typical Cyprus tavernas, where you can eat the famous Cyprus meze! Just one warning: they bring a lot of food so go there hungry!!",Zanettos
40,Atmosphere and music is good. Waitress and people are very friendly. It will be an enjoyable dinner.,Zanettos
40,In the area of old town in nicosia a good choice of restaurant with local food. You need to make a reservation because is a small place!Good quality of food and quanties! Nice service with a good variety of local wines! The parking in the area might be little difficult.,Zanettos
50,"Always fresh, hand picked ingredients by the chef on a daily basis (I witnessed it)! Excellent meze variety, delicious, plenty, truly local and really tasty!",Zanettos
50,If you like cyprus mezze come to this place its the best in town and its a set menu. Vegans and Vegeterians are not welcome here.,Zanettos
50,"The food is great!!!!! The fresh cooked food ,service friendly and excellent better than any 5 stars hotel",Zanettos
50,"If you want traditional/authentic meze in Nicosia, then go to Zanettos. Panayiotis (owner) will treat you always with a smile.",Zanettos
50,"We had dinner here on Jul.14 : took taxi from Hilton Park Nicosia ( approx. 20 euro round trip). Zanettos is a Cypriotic restaurant with a very long tradition going back to 1938!Current owner bought it from familymembers of original starting owner so the restaurant is like going back in Cyprus cooking history . The walls are covered with pictures with owner and visitors, there are several rooms conecting to each other and forming the actual restaurant plus for those who smoke there is an open air terrace! The menu is fixed and the protions are according to the number of dinners ! We were with 2 but our portions could have fed 2 more hungry eaters... Once seated with a drink the plates started coming out : tahine , pitta , at least 3 variations on several salads , rice with spinach , pork ribs , snails ( tried 1 and passed), baked liver( had a bit but too heavy) , some kind of local sausage - grilled to perfection-meat mixed with herbs and ognion, bulgur... ! In total we got at least 15 different plates giving us a taste of a lot of the local plates as they are prepared in Cyprus! To finish us - and the meal - we got a kind of tapioca pudding with rosewater as well as a huge portion of melon and watermelon which we sadly had to leave almost untouched ...This is an experience for at least one dinner while on Cyprus but do not eat anything in the 12 hours before your visit or you wil return a few full plates to the kitchen and that brings out cooks and owner asking if there was something wrong with the food :))We were the only non -cypriots on the evening we visited but there is multi lingual staff and the owner travlled the world and is a very generous , genial type proud of his restaurant and rightly so !!",Zanettos
50,"An endless party of traditional dishes served by lovely staff with a huge smile. You cannot say you have tested cyprus if you do not pay a visit to this wonderful place, surrounded by fotos of all the popular people that have sat in its tables and full of irresistible smells.",Zanettos
50,"Great place, a big variety on the meze so much that you can't eat all... Good food, well cooked and great service. I like this place also for business lunches/dinners its a good representative for cypriot hospitality, cuisine and generosity.",Zanettos
50,"Food served is lovely, there are a couple of uncommon to traditional meze dishes which add a nice twist. Good service, polite and nice people.",Zanettos
10,"Party of 10 people, we ordered meze and asked the staff to gauge an appropriate amount. They seemed to take this as an opportunity to clear the kitchen of eveything they were trying to shift. Early doors we asked the waiter to hold back on bringing more food, the request was completely ignored and the food continued to arrive as if the cook was in a mad rush to get home. With the exception of one lamb chop dish, the meats were so over-cooked to be completely tasteless, dry and tough. By the end, over half the food was left unfinished and I assume therefore thrown away. Although deaf the staff were friendly enough but if you enjoy food, don't eat at this restaurant.",Zanettos
50,"Excellent food from a traditional restaurant. Friendly service and huge amount of food cooked to perfection. We ordered meze and the dishes just kept on coming.Highly recommended,one of our best meals in Cyprus",Zanettos
50,"Great food, lot of variety, perfect Mezedes . Very traditional atmosphere , quick service and polite. I fully recommended for a traditional Cyprus food experience ........",Zanettos
50,"If you want a traditional Cyrus maze, this is the place. Pleasant staff, located in the old city, fantastic food and more than plenty, and fair pricing. So go. You will love it.",Zanettos
50,"The food is incredible. There's a lot of it though, so make sure you come on a really empty stomach! The staff are lovely and very welcoming! Recommended and definitely want to come again before I leave to go back to UK!",Zanettos
50,"the place is nice and so is the chef, the only problem is that the food is tooo much, u need to go when u are really hungry, authentic cypriot cuisine in a cozy environment",Zanettos
50,"Great food, service and environment. A very pleasant experience. I would definitely recommend to friends and people visiting Nicosia from abroad. It is a traditional place with traditional greek/Cypriot food to die for! Also the portions are huge..good value for money.",Zanettos
50,Once u go u always end up at Zanettos. Great great meze. All the staff is absolutely great. The njoy servicing they njoy cooking,Zanettos
50,If you only go to one restaurant in Cyprus for meze choose Zanettos. You won't regret it. Fabulous food and friendly staff. Don't eat for 24 hours before you go though!,Zanettos
50,The best tavern in town. The food is amazing and the portions are huge! The service is great and the food is of great quality. Totally recomended!,Zanettos
40,This was our only meze in our 2 week trip. An eclectic mix of dishes that reflect a country that has been occupied by diverse conquerors over the ages. Wasn't expecting snails! Good fun. Get in early for a table and book ahead. Very popular with the locals.,Zanettos
50,"One of the best traditional Cypriot tavern in Nicosia. If you looking for traditional Cypriot mezedes this place is a must. They will serve you more than 15 different dishes, from starters to desserts all cook in perfection. Best value for money tavern.",Zanettos
50,"We had an excellent dinner in a lovely restaurant. The portions of meze are very big, you can""t finish all the food. Don""t miss this restaurant if you go to Nicosia. Also locals love it!",Zanettos
50,we celebrated my partners birthday here and it is as good as we remembered! they serve amazing food. everything is fresh and the portions are big too. Their meze is a must and i am so glad we went there as we haven't been for a while. Give it a go!!,Zanettos
50,"We visited Zanettos several times. Consistent quality and fast service every visit. Nice food. Everything is fresh, the recipes are local, traditional cuisine. Recommend to try at least once! Sure that you will go again!",Zanettos
30,"Great place to taste almost everything associated with Cyprus cuisine. Vast selection of meze plates, but don't expect great quality out of all plates...good bang for your money but not one of the best places for Cypriot meze.",Zanettos
50,"The best way to describe Zanettos' amazing food would be ""where the chefs eat""! Everything is fresh, the recipes are local, traditional, yet imaginative which offer you an unforgettable experience",Zanettos
50,"Went to Zanettos a few years and it was excellent. As usual most places the standard drops and quality drops after a few years. I am happy to say that this place has continued to serve good quality, tasty and a vast variation of dishes. If anyone has not been there before well worth the visit and value for money",Zanettos
50,"warm atmosphere, traditional environment, excellent service, delicious food. EXCELLENT! well worth visit!",Zanettos
50,"From the antique Victoria Arduino coffee machine to the Vespa the decor is fun. The place is full, of people, noise, fun and food. This is a glorious way of eating. Plate after plate of interesting dishes, salads with simple sauces, grilled meat, mint, pistachio, nutmeg, fresh fruit. A veritable feast. It is a great place to make, and be, friends.",Zanettos
50,"Outstanding food, best service around, well worth value for money. A place not to be missed. Thanks from Palestine.",Zanettos
40,If you want to taste local Cypriot dishes in Nicosia i think is one of the best place to visit. I ate there a lot of times i like very much this restaurant.,Zanettos
50,"The staff is very helpful ,the service is very good, but being a vegeterian there is limited variation of veggie food.",Zanettos
40,They serve authentic cypriot food.Different kind of cypriot meze and am sure tourists would like to taste everything. Must visit.,Zanettos
40,"Wonderful Food, Ambiance is amazing, takes you back in time! Being a Vegetarian, the options were limited but the staff was kind enough to specially cook something veg for me. Staff are friendly warm and jovial! Must visit",Zanettos
30,"Volume yes, but otherwise not over impressed! Never ending food being served, you would be well advised to leave half of each plate coming out! Typical local cuisine!",Zanettos
50,"The place is well packaged as an experience. Ambiance, style of service, quality of food and all. Just go and eat well!",Zanettos
40,"Second time here - superb meze. V tasty, came to the table at just the right time intervals to allow us to enjoy what was presented before another fantastic dish arrived. Only criticism was that, delicious tho it certainly was, there was just too much, Felt really bad about leaving so much gorgeous food.Service brilliant. Good ambiance. Well worth a visit, but if you're having dinner try to skip lunch that day !",Zanettos
50,Excellent environment and the best food in Cyprus highly recommended. Atmosphere very traditional and the quality of food is amazing,Zanettos
20,"Even though this place has excellent meze, may be the best in the old city, I personally cannot enjoy my food when I can smell cigarette smoke. Even though there is an 'outside' space where the smokers are supposed to be sitting, the connecting doors remain open for the waiters to pass thru so the smoke inevitably reaches the non-smoking inside area. On top of that the owner is a smoker and he sometimes smokes as he walks by the tables inside and also at the cashier room inside the restaurant.",Zanettos
40,"Great (traditional) atmosphere, great service, and most of all: great food!The food was delicious. Taste, quality and quantity of first grade.Waiters efficient, gentle and smiling (even under pressure).It's been a long time since the last time I got enthusiast with a place offering cyprus meze/food plates!Price? ‚Ç¨2-4 higher than usual, but I'm sure it worths the difference.Highly recommended!",Zanettos
40,"Here you can enjoy traditional cypriot meze dishes, including grilled halloumi, grilled traditional cypriot sausage, grilled mushroom, grilled lountza meat pre-cooked in red wine, chicken souvlaki, pork souvlaki, delicious sieftalia and some other cooked dishes, such as snails. The desserts are so yummy, including the traditional ""halvas katsarolas with cinnamon"", ""lebanese mahalepi"" and ""glika koutaliou"". The service is pretty good and the atmosphere, as well. What I really dislike there is the policy of ""Zanettos"" which actually ""forces"" you to order as many meze dishes as the number of people sitting on the table. This makes people who just want to join a table for the company and not want to eat, unable to be there. This is unbelievable, unacceptable and I tend to avoid the eating places which have this policy.",Zanettos
50,"I ate here with a group of colleagues from about 8 countries. Everyone was completely blown away by the fantastic food and atmosphere here. A truly amazing experience, meze after meze after meze. Make sure you don't eat too much at the start...there's a lot to follow!",Zanettos
50,Visited a number of times throughout the years its been open and I think it gets better every time. If you are a local but especially if you are a tourist and want to try Cypriot cuisine make sure to stop by for a 'meze' (However make sure you come with an empty stomach!!!),Zanettos
50,Had a lovely meal with friends. Staff very friendly and accommodate our ever request !! Very busy so would recommend booking in advance,Zanettos
50,"Revisiting Zanettos after quite some time, I can confirm that it is the no.1 taverna in Nicosia as far as quality, quantity and variety of the mezzedes are concerned. True original cyprus dishes without being ""tampered"". Excellent quick and very friendly service. Very popular with locals daily, located within the old part of Nicosia in an area and premises with its own charm! Parking can be a bit tricky though.Prices are reasonable considering what you get. Will definitely revisit!",Zanettos
50,"As far as I can tell, there's only one thing on Zanetto's menu - meze. It's certainly all I was offered, and I don't know if there's a vegetarian option.For variety of flavours and textures, this was the best. I especially liked the lightly battered zucchini.My only complaint is that there was SO much food I couldn't get anywhere near to finishing it - my single portion would definitely have fed two. If you go, go hungry. By the end I was almost feeling ill with the amount of food left on the table.Slightly pricey (for Nicosia) at ‚Ç¨21, but well worth it.",Zanettos
40,"Was invited for dinner here - and although my host apoogized for serving ""only"" 44 mezedes instead of the traditional 53(!!), I left the restaurant exceptionally full and hoping to return some other time!I will not claim to remember even half the dishes - but apart from the liver (which had nothing to do with the quality of it), I enjoyed the entire meal immensely!Service was informal but expedient, and just what one expects from a friendly place like this!The host found local wines, that went very well with the huge variety of dishes!",Zanettos
40,"Had a great atmospheric evening at Zanettos. The meze is the standard (and only!) item on the menu, a 21-dish meal with great Mediterranean and Greek flavours. The portions are big though, so come with hunger",Zanettos
50,"In these place best sandwiches i'v seen)) Very very tasty, with souvlaki and another meat) True Cypriot food with real Cypriot hospitality)))",Zanettos
40,"If you have just arrived in Cyprus this is the perfect place to ""taste"" the island's famous meze. Zanettos has been around for ages and for a good reason as it offers a great atmosphere and delicious food. Prices could have been a little lower but there not going to break the bank. Make sure to try their village wine.",Zanettos
30,"The restaurant is known for its typical Cypriot mezedes (appetizers.) About 21 a la cart appetizers were served--some were tasty and others ordinary. Despite the friendly service, our overall impression was that the meal was passable and not a memorable experience.",Zanettos
30,the restaurant serves a fixed menu of 21 i think small plates‚Ä¶.some were really good some indifferent ‚Ä¶ it refers to a kind of food entertainment that is definitely not my style‚Ä¶eating is a ritual‚Ä¶and you do not need to eat a lot to eat well‚Ä¶however the service is excellent and could go back for the fun of the whole thing,Zanettos
30,Since it is a known restaurant I expected more. Nevertheless the food was above average and the place its quite nice to visit.,Zanettos
50,"About 30 different succulent dishes came gradually to our table, in the end we were almost dead by all this amount of perfect delicious food! Charming atmosphere, very unique place!",Zanettos
50,"A very cozy yet large restaurant with lots of variety of food and very nice staff , great ambiance with lovely music . The food is great. Big thumbs up !",Zanettos
50,"A lot of very, very tasty food that just doesn't stop coming (our waitress might've been enjoying bombarding us with more and more food just a tiny bit too much, but it was a great laugh) and service with a great smile.",Zanettos
40,"Zanettos is a lively meze restaurant inside the walls of the city. The food starts coming almost immediately and continues long after your appetite is sated. Some of the dishes were very good, others less interesting but it felt like a reasonably authentic experience and there were mostly Cypriots dining there. A very enjoyable evening - don't fill up on the first dishes because there is better to come.",Zanettos
50,Good Cyprus meze. Not very big portions but still so much food that you can't eat it all. The service is TOP level for a traditional tavern. Good scenery as it is an old house in the old town.,Zanettos
30,"Service is great and wine list was ""extensive"" given that it‚Äòs a taverna. The meze, well after 23 years in Cyprus and some of the rave reviews, I was disappointed. A great selection of orektika or appetisers, salad for 2 is the same size as a salad for 4, so good value quantity wise, quality was lacking unfortunately. Booking is essential.",Zanettos
30,"The price for meze is the highest I've ever paid in Cyprus. The food is below average (for my taste) despite its large quantity. Also, the waiters don't seem to have the patience to correctly place the plates on the table.",Zanettos
50,"If you are unfamiliar with the Cyprus meze, brace yourself! This milestone restaurant guarantees meats, salads, bbqs and stews, a mixture of most traditional dishes in great quantity but more importantly great quality. Enjoy! I always do",Zanettos
50,I could write for an hour on this place - I won't. Stop reading this review and just book a table. Don't eat breakfast or lunch if you are going here for dinner!,Zanettos
50,"I visited this Tavern with my parent in March. Once you enter this establishment, there is not much to me impressed by.. It is old and not much space.. So you wait and see, because we were recommended this tavern as the best in the city.. You can only order you drinks, because the only food served is a traditional meze. But once the food started to come out, it was a feast! Absolutely a real food experience! And the environment starts to charm you. We paid a 100 euros for 3 persons including our wine, and the was a lot of left overs which you are offered to bring home.A pleasant surprise!",Zanettos
40,Huge quantity. Qualitative Cypriot food. A must go restaurant if you will go to Nicosia! The service is very goodand the decoration of the restaurant a Cypriot retro beauty. But the building itself is old enough.,Zanettos
40,"I was visiting one of my friend in Nicosia and her family brought me there for dinner the last night I was in the city.Zanettos is a tipical and very nice tabern. You don't have to order anything, just the drinks, and the meal starts coming! It's a kind of ""tapas"" in the greek-cypriot style.The food is greek and cypriot and it's very very very good, just be sure that you have room in your stomach!!The staff are very friendly and people like taking pictures with the owner. You can see a lot of pictures on the wall with the owner and artists from Greece and Cyprus.You are gonna love this place!",Zanettos
40,"for sure you have to visit it, many many plates of food, mezedes, nice traditional atmosphere, nice food",Zanettos
50,One of the loveliest tavernas in the old town of Nicosia. Has character and atmosphere. The meze is tasty and plentiful so make sure you go there real hungry. It's barbecue is always consistent and cooked real good. Indoors and outdoors options so no issue if you are a smoker,Zanettos
40,nice atmosphere ...old tavern ...with many greek and cypriot delicasies ...you should visit the place for sure ! nice friendly atmosphere and staff and the owner will take care of you as he is a great guy !,Zanettos
40,"What is more important is the welcoming of the ownership in this restaurant. The food is good , I would say honest. Authentic cuisine, a bit lacking in being actually tasty, but this is only recognizable to a Greek or Cypriot native. Isn't this telling them that it is a bit touristic?",Zanettos
40,Great spread of Meze options. Short walk from our accommodation (The Sandstone - recommended). Good mix of locals and tourists.,Zanettos
50,"I have been going here for years and apart from changing the decoration when they renovated, everything has stayed the same - mainly the excellent food and service that you get.A very good example of the old, traditional taverns of old - good food, service and atmosphere.",Zanettos
30,A nice tavern with good food overall. But the last few times we went there the quality was not as expected. 60% was good but the other times it was below average..,Zanettos
50,"What an amazing place!! Panayiotis greeted me & my friends with a warm smile and beckoned us in. As we had pre-booked, for a group of 8 people, a table had been made up for us both inside and outside in the courtyard... a nice touch. We chose the outside courtyard and Panayiotis happily opened up the canopy to give us a view of the stars. We didn't think it could get any better but once the meal started to come out we were in our element... My friends and I love our food and we were treated to one of the best Meze we had ever tasted. You have to go here, if you are in Nicosia Old Town, the atmosphere was excellent and best of all the restaurant was packed with local people, which says a lot for the quality of the dishes. Please note we were not shown a menu as you come here for the Meze (‚Ç¨21 per head), so sit down, let out your belt and enjoy one of the best meals around.",Zanettos
50,"Very warm, lovely place. Great flavours, nice service! It really is authentic taverna. It's like to dinner to grandma. Highly recommended!",Zanettos
40,"Masses of food, comes at pace but delicious and a lovely wee tavern. Lots of locals use it, which is always a good sign. Great value and great food.",Zanettos
50,One of the best food experiences I've ever had! And the staff are super friendly! The prices are great compared to the quality and quantities!,Zanettos
50,"First of all, prepare for your visit by skipping lunch. The food just keeps coming till you're about to explode... and each dish is a beatific joy. There is no menu. Once you sit down, plate after plate arrives... a traditional Cypriot mezze concept. There are some gorgeous dishes in the mix... Pork chops, Greek salad, fried zucchini, snails, souvlaki, ravioli to name a few. 15 dishes in all... And three types of dessert. It's a flat price of 21 Euros at time of writing, more than competitive compared with the modern restaurants on Ledra, and with enough atmosphere and history to write tomes. The place has been in operation since 1938. The owner Pete (anglicized from a Greek name I can't spell) will make you feel right at home. Oh, and even after skipping lunch, you might want to skip breakfast the next day, too.",Zanettos
50,Zanettos is a tavern which serves traditional cypriot meze. There is a variety of meze dishes of very good quality. Highly recommended.,Zanettos
40,If you want to try Cypriot food this is the place to go. You get a taste of lots of things with their meze. First time I went was more than 10 years ago and still today you get the same service and quality as before.,Zanettos
40,"I've experienced great, huges and never ending mezes... pork and chicken were tastefully as we had in our past years. Traditional food and really good quality.All of ingredients seem to jump out from the grandma's pantry and respect the rules of cypriot cousin.I've tried to reachthe end of the mese course but was hard job...lkved hallumi cheese and potatoes and chicken souvlaki and lukanico and salad and ... and....Efkaristos also to the staff...I will be back soon...",Zanettos
50,Had dinner there with friends. Excellent service and quality food. Recomended to Nicosia visitors. A must to go!!!!!!!!!,Zanettos
40,"I had high expectations for this place after reading all the reviews here and it didn't disappoint. They don't have a menu, they just bring you their standard mezes and meats. You need to come hungry as the amount of food is simply too much. Once we were finished, the owner asked us if we need anything else, we asked for more sheftalias and he gladly brought more at no extra charge. Their wine menu was pretty good and reasonably priced. We chose a local red wine and it perfectly complimented all the meat. Once we were done eating, they brought us desserts and a shot of commandaria (Cypriot sweet wine), nice touch. I'll visit this place again for sure.",Zanettos
40,"Recommended bij Tripadvisor, I walked tonight to Zanettos, right outside the pedestrian zone of Nikosia. First thing I heard after the 'welcome', was ' you cannot choose what you eat'. Indeed it was mezze, full stop. It started withan assortment of around 6 small dished and after that, it just never stopped. Including main course, I received 17 smaller and bigger dishes. Unnecessary to mention that I couldn't eat it all. But no worries, I was immediately proposed to take some of the delicious food home. When I then thought I was done, another 3 desert dishes and some desert wine arrived ...THe food was very well but far to much for one person. Warm en gentile people full of attention for their guests. Nice environment, very typical, with a good atmosphere.When you like mezze, this is the place to be !",Zanettos
50,"food is too much here, very good but too much, u need to walk all around old nicosia to digest a meal in this fantastic old town tavern, definetly reccomnded, friendly people and good cypriot food",Zanettos
40,"Coasy restaurant with friendly service serving a set course for 21 ‚Ç¨.Initially I was happy to see that all the wines were kept in a wine fridge. I got disappointed to see that the wine fridge for the reds were not turned on...:-( We got there with a bucket with ice/water but it's not ideal since the first glass is always to warm and the last ones ending being too cold. Turn the wine fridge on, please, and I will award You 4 * (very good).Food was Meze, around 20 dishes. It was generally good and there was so much food that I could not believe my own eyes.",Zanettos
50,"Meze was excellent! Every portion was made with love! Great Cypriot red wine (from winery near Limassol)! My friends and me had a great time, thanks a lot to everybody from the staff of the tavern! I'll be back here next time for meat meze again.",Zanettos
10,"Unless you weight 300pounds with diabetes and high blood pressure, this place is not for you.We showed up with 2 adults and 3 young kids and the mezze started coming.After a while given the limited appetite of the family we requested that they stopped as we had more than enough.First they smiled but ignored our request. The mezzes kept coming.Second they were laughing in the background while more mezzes still landed on the table.Shocking!We put an end to the ripoff of this dodgy restaurant by settling the bill, whatever they charged us, and left.Any restaurant with the minimum level of care, professionalism and ethics would take better care of their customers.",Zanettos
50,"We came into Zanettos to get a Maze. We heard that this is one of the best places to get a Maze in Cyprus. And I have to agree with that. Apart from all the food that keeps coming (amazing food) they brought a cake for the birthday girl, lots of wine from the house (real good), fruits and dessert! I have no words to describe how amazing the food is, and not only that but the service. We were attented like kings and queens in this place, even though it sounds like I'm exaggerating, I am not. If you come to Cyprus and you don't come to this place you are totally missing out. I recommend it to a 100%.Good luck, enjoy, and safe travels!",Zanettos
40,small and cosy place in the walled city of nicosia. They bring too enormous amount of food; good quality mezes. Good service as I remember. The place gets very crowded but worth a visit. Good example of greek cypriot cuisine,Zanettos
40,"Very good quality and (even more so) quantity of traditional Cypriot specialities in a nice atmosphere and a professional / pleasant service. The wine selection and quality were also very good. However, it was not possible to have any other alternative than the meze. While, on the one hand it sounds nice to hear the waiters telling you ""Please select your drinks and the rest is our job"", I would prefer to have some degree of flexibility. Unless you know in advance the long list of the various meze dishes, there is a high probability that you will not manage to eat some nice plates because simply they were brought in at the very end of the parade..... when your stomach was more than full! I think, in the absence of an alternative, the tavern should have a list and fotos of the meze-dishes so that the visitors can decide which ones to eat and which not. The order by which the meze variations are served does not necessarily reflect the preferred order of every customer.",Zanettos
50,Awesome typical Meze. Very delicious but way too much. :-D We will definitely be there during our next visit again.,Zanettos
40,"Old fashioned taverna - with traditional Cypriot dishes. Too many dishes with clashing tastes, as is the tradition in these kind of places. Not cheap either. Wine list OK (nothing special but again one doesn't expect it to be).",Zanettos
50,"Great taverna for a traditional meze, the spanakorizo and the liver were amazing. Really bustling, they have smoking and non-smoking areas, but basically it's smokey inside. Only downside is that they tend to serve a bit too fast.",Zanettos
50,"If you like authentic Cypriot food then this is the place, it's Meze or Meze as that is all they serve, BUT it's fab! Don't eat all day before you go and you might make it to the end of the meal, but I doubt it. Superb.",Zanettos
50,"After years I went to Zanettos again and liked the old fashioned interior style much.It was Meze for dinner. I love Meze because one cannot really have it in my homecountry Austria.The pity is that so much is usually left over because already the starters are so delicious that one will not waitUntil main-dish, as vegetarian I in addition do not wait for the fleshy side and enjoy the salads and cremes in a double way,We had fine white and red wine as well as rakia (is it written like that), a wonderful evening with delicious food in a nostalgicsurroundings, the circumstance that bit of the stuff made a grumpyface , but was quick in delivery fitted perfectly :) ,very recommendable place!",Zanettos
50,"Great food (both in terms of quality and quantity) at reasonable process. Excellent service, very attentive and friendly waitresses. The atmosphere is good provided that you are in a tavern. Highly recommended!",Zanettos
50,We went twice and it was an excellent fish restaurant. Great value for money too - you wouldn't get a fifth of the quality and quantity for the price where I live.,Zanettos
50,Simply one of the best Cypriot tavern in the heart of the old town!A variety of well cooked dishes and one of the best thing are the delicious deserts to end this excellent experience there.You pay something more but it worth.A must go visit without a doubt.,Zanettos
40,"A traditional style tavern which offers a menu of over 20 dishes. Relax, take a deep breath and start eating. Only complain the poor wine list.",Zanettos
50,"Fabulous typical Cypriot place! Trust the waiters' knowledge of wine, they know what you like. No comments about the food, a MUST in Nicosia! P.S. Probably the only restaurant, where the machine does not ask for tips and so you want to give even more!",Zanettos
50,Exellent food cooked from the heart. Very good Service. Panagiotis the owner is an amazing host. Do not go there if you want to eat light! The food never stops coming. We have never managed to finish off our meze.,Zanettos
50,"The sheer amount and quality of meze we were served was astounding! We had a chance to try a wide variety of Cyprus mezes, from intriguing garlic vinegar mashed potatoes, perfectly seasoned beets, green parsley salad to all kinds of char grilled meets and beguiling dessert containing rose syrup and pistachios. All this plus a half a bottle of wine and one beer for, yes, you read it right, 55 euros! The restaurant is atmospheric and the service is good. Must visit this place when in town!",Zanettos
50,"In my opinion Zanettos has the best meze in town, I've been here a couple of times for dinner and I've always been more than satisfied! I can totally recommend this restaurant",Zanettos
50,"If you visit Zanettos, you'll taste almost all the traditional dishes Cyprus has to offer. The food is really tasty. Order a local red wine, which comes in a carafe, you must try it!",Zanettos
50,"Among interior that looks as if it hasn't changed since the opening 70-some years ago you get to taste the essence of Cyprian cuisine. Yes the portions are hige and uneatable unless you're an elephant but if you decide to go there you should know what you are up for. Totally remarkable place - if I am ever back to Nicosia, I am definitely coming back.",Zanettos
50,"Always preserving quality. Customer satisfaction its a priority! Staff excellent, always willing to help!",Zanettos
30,"Heard about it a lot!couldn't wait to visit!But when I finally got there with a company of around ten people,we were all very disappointed!The food was average with some of the meat dishes not chewable!was like rubber!Service was good but i think they were a little stressed and made a few mistakes!the worst part was the Bill!23 euros per person,drinks excluded!i don't think i would recommend it!there are much better places with better prices and food quality!",Zanettos
50,"The owner is very friendly, they have a nice selection of wines and you have to be starved to death in order to eat all the great food they serve.",Zanettos
50,There is no menu and they just keep bringing the food. It was copious and absolutely delicious! The restaurant has been around for 72 years and it is filled with character. It was one of our best meals in Cyprus. Definitely a redo and definitely recommened.,Zanettos
50,What a findWe had the Meze with every form of meat you could think of done on a Char Grill/BBQLamb Chicken Sausage Pork Beef Vegetables Salad Bread all washed down with the fine Local Beer (Name escapes me) and of course Ouzo You won't be disappointed here!,Zanettos
50,Service very quick! Food was amazing! A lot of food! And the prices very good for the food the bring! Thoroughly recommend!!!!,Zanettos
50,Portions are always huge and the service always great! Loving visiting this tavern over and over again. Good quality. A classic tavern in Nicosia old town.,Zanettos
50,"It is placed at the central of Nicosia and it is well known to allmost all the people of Nicosia. As soon asyou enter the place the owner wellcomes you with an old traditional Cyprus way. He puts on your hands rosewater and with a bright smile shows you. to your seat. Then you have to order what you like to drink. The rest food comes with the drinks. In Cyprus we call this food mezes. This means many little plates with splendid food. First here comes the ordeves. Taxini , olives, tzatziki, taramas, e.t.c. After these all , you can have different cyprus way cooked meats. There is souvla , ( pork meat cooked over fire like barbeque), kebab and sieftalia ( small parts of pork cooked over fire and mincemeat rolled in special way, very delicious. Also, you can have chichen , lamp, and beef meat all cooked in cyprus traditional way. You get sausages , beetroots with vivegar, fetta, chips with fresh potatoes, pasta with halloumi ( special cheese ) and many more plates with yammy food. The place is decorated. In old , traditional way with many things that reminds us old Cyprus",Zanettos
40,"I have been to this restaurant numerous times with friends. It's the best mezze I've had in Cyprus. Staff are friendly and helpful. We were really lucky going one night in summer and lucked into a half price special on drinks so it was a really inexpensive night. The only dish I wouldn't try was the snails! I don't like them. There is an assortment of vegetarian dishes within the mezze but there is a lot of meat. All of us felt like we needed a wheel barrow to get home in, we ate so much!",Zanettos
30,"Good food but not my kind of atmosphere. I think the are trying to create that ""traditional"" look but it seems a bit ""cheap"" in side..",Zanettos
40,"went there by indication of a person living in Nicosia otherwise would be hard to find it. the restaurant has a nice with tradicional decoration and lots of photos on the walls giving a cosy familiar atmosphere.The menu only has one choice and that is the abundant meze. Dishes of food start to arrive almost immediately and they are so many that we cannot keep up tasting a bit of each, and cannot even think of finishing them. By the middle of the meal we realise that the stomach is so full that it cannot take more, but then so many other dishes and akso a few deserts will come and you still fit in a bit more of each just to taste. The food is in general well condimented but not too much and seems to give an all round picture of cypriotic food. Prices are a bit above other restaurants but it is within ok prices, especially considering the amounts.",Zanettos
30,"Food is good, though expensive compared to other reputable mezze places. The place is packed with small groups 8 to 12 diners, very noisy Thursdays, Fri and Sat nights. A bit uncomfortable seating and ok service. Perhaps a good place if you are in the old city, but not worth the trip if you go there specifically to eat there. Overall I would not recommend it.",Zanettos
50,"This lovely restaurant was recommending by our Segway Tour Guide, as we stipulated that we wanted traditional Cypriot food, not tourist restaurant. Oh boy did this place deliver. There is no menu as they only serve Meze. The Staff are just lovely, making you feel so welcome. The food was just amazing, dish after delicious dish just kept coming. It was all fresh and tasty. Just be hungry and enjoy at your leisure.",Zanettos
40,"Friendly staff, good quality food and endless quantities. One of its major advantages is that it is open till late when most of the other restaurants are closed. Very popular among VIPs. If you are in the old city it worths a try. When you are there try ""mezedes""... But better be very hungry",Zanettos
50,"Warm, friendly atmosphere. Fantastic food. A Cypriot experience we will long remember. And free WiFi on top of it all.",Zanettos
50,"It was a fund evening out with friends...loved the athmospere, and the food...meat all along...would love to have another go..next trip to cyprus",Zanettos
50,"A Nicosia institution for several decades we went on the basis of a not altogether trusted guidebook review. There is no menu, you just get dish after dish of every meze variation you can think of. It gets crowded later but is not impossible to get in at all. The trick is to pace yourself; just when you think you're sated a whole pile of freshly cooked meat or vegetable dishes arrives. Perhaps fewer fish dishes than expected but it would be churlish to complain. Plainly served and not superficially stylish this is a Nicosia restaurant in which to get thoroughly well fed with fresh and well cooked food. Not at all expensive for what you get.",Zanettos
50,"this is a simple tavern with nice atmosphere and food, there is an indoor garden as well, people are friendly and the food very tasty, local dishes, seasonal and meze!",Zanettos
30,"Our attitude in Cyprus is that when we establish our name we forget about those who helped us.This is what you convey when you impose your clients what they have to order, and we are not talking about a minimum of two meze which is common in many restaurants in Cyprus.I gave you the opportunity, because it was my birthday, to prove that you have this attitude because you are the best. But you are not.Bad service, they spilled everything on two tables and on women's clothes.Medium quality souvlakia & sheftalia. No lamp chops, no pastourma.And at the end, instead of giving a discount due to the bad service that cost an expensive blouse, they gave discount vouchers for next time. I hope you understand, there won't be a next time.You need to think of your client policy, especially at times like the present one in Cyprus.",Zanettos
30,"Terrible hangover, this place used to be our favourite for years, the last two years its been terrible and heavily commercialised. Won't go there again.",Zanettos
50,"It is a fixed menu and the food just keeps coming and coming. Service was excellent. we chose a local rose wine and it was good. We tend to eat early, like 1930, so there was only one other couple there at first. The place filled up after about 2030. The wait staff really were running, but service still was maintained. Very reasonably priced. We were there on a Friday evening about 2 weeks ago. Definitely add this to your bucket list for Nicosia.",Zanettos
50,"All the Cyprus specialities in one place, really great food which comes all the time, very friendly service, value for money for all this... True hospitality!!",Zanettos
50,Real cypriot traditional food. Fantastic atmosphere and traditional dishes. Do not miss when you visit Nicosia. Strongly suggested...,Zanettos
50,"A Must place to visit when you are in Nicosia. Friendly staff, traditional atmosphere and the most important ... the Food ! Best meze ever ... you must try those meze at any cost ... 5 stars !",Zanettos
30,This place is hard to find if you don't know about it. The place itself says nothing but the food is great. Many personalities have been there too and you see it in the pictures. Very friendly people and cosy atmosphere. Will go back.,Zanettos
50,"Zanettos is the Best Meze food in Cyprus. Highly recommended , if you visit Cyprus you should give it a try",Zanettos
50,My local office contact took me here and the food was excellent! This restaurant has been around for a very long time. It's a favorite spot of celebrities & politicians in Cyprus. Their pictures cover the wall.We had the mezze and everything was outstanding. I would definitely go back!,Zanettos
50,"Well, after frequenting for more than 80 times to this excellent Cyprus Tavern the first great impressions on the very friendly atmosphere and the huge quantity of super food and, the initial wows were somewhat diminished. It seems one can get used to anything!!!",Zanettos
50,"I came here with friends on a Saturday night. The mezze was extraudinary it came with all the usual meat and sausages along with some vegetable dishes I hadn't come accross before, all of which very tasty! Service was good, simple decoration, entertaining photographs throughout the place. Would reccomend!",Zanettos
50,"If there is only one restaurant you visit whilst in Nicosia, make it Zanettos! I cannot recommend it enough. The food was of highest quality and the service 5 star!! The owner was lovely and took the time to come over & join us, as well as giving a nice souvenir to remember the evening. The whole dining experience was fantastic, and you most certainly wont leave hungry!!",Zanettos
50,"Very good, very friendly, really nice traditional restaurant. If you go to Nicosia, go there! Not easy to find, I come back for sure;-))",Zanettos
50,"Really, the rest of the ""excellent"" ratings sum it up: fantastic food, great atmosphere, wonderful staff It's really a beautiful tavern. Must see place. Enjoy",Zanettos
50,It is difficult for locals to find a good Cypriot tavern that will satisfy their demanding taste. Zanettos managed to achieve that by offering good quality food (lots of it!) and a great service in a fantastic place full of history. The owner/manager is very attentive of his customers as are the waiters. I would recommend this tavern without any hesitation.,Zanettos
40,"We visited the restaurant for traditional Cypriot food. It was all delicious however the wait staff were not very attentive , opting to circle a large family table. We may have been unlucky but felt very second best to the local table who were eating.Good food but prepare to be treat like the tourist!",Zanettos
50,"We went to the tavern for the first time last Saturday, Being a couple we had no choice but to order meze for 2. The food quanityt is overwhelming. So many different dishes full of different tastes from Cyprus.The meze dishes are really big. One village sausage for each person, two large pieces of halloumi white cheese, a bowl full of liver, a sealed yoghurt pot, big bowls of dips(not the usual small plates being half full), a large variety of chicken and pork souvlaki along with shieftalia and many many more dishes.As expected we left half of the food on the table. We had seen that a huge variety of desserts was expecting us. A plate of fruit, lebanese mahalepi cream, halva, traditional sweets from Cyprus and coffee was offered to us free of charge.And above all service was excellent as well as the ambiance and the whole environment.The tavern has a separated place for smokers which is clearly ""sealed"" therefore no cigarette smell will annoy any non-smokers. My wife is pregnant so i had clarified that over the phone and we were glad that this was the case when we got there.The price is a bit high per person in comparison to other meze taverns. But believe me there is nothing to be compared in regards to the food quality and quantity.I will definately go back with friends and family and i highly recommend the place to locals or visitors.",Zanettos
50,"Meat is juicy and tender, great selection and traditional food that makes this taverna the best in town.However be warned make sure you skip bfast,lunch and snacks before visiting. My favorite are the deep fried courgettes, sheftalia, smoked wine sausages and ravioli!",Zanettos
40,"Tavern worths a visit - Quality food, fresh ingredients, respect to customers, staff politeness and care.",Zanettos
30,"Went there for dinner with professional company from abroad. The food was nice and plenty. The service was pleasant and good! The place does remind of old times. However we found the prices a bit high for the setting and type of meze. It was 40 Euro per person for meze, simple drinks and desert.",Zanettos
50,"On a business trip to Cyprus, I asked my Cypriot colleague to take me for a typical Cypriot meal - he took me to Zanettos.As everyone has already said - the dishes kept coming and coming - I think there are about 20 in all. Luckily my colleague had advised me to just taste each dish rather than fill up on the first few selections. Each dish was freshly and beautifully made with fabulous flavours.Although I didn't even make a dent in the food offered, I tasted each dish.This is an absolute essential experience for anyone visiting Cyprus and wanting to experience the real thing. One thing I would say is that we ate early about 7.30pm but as we were leaving it did start to get VERY busy.",Zanettos
50,"My friend Stavros introduced me to this restaurant. Plate after plate kept coming every one as tasty as the last, my husband is vegetarian and he could not believe the tasty treats that came out of the kitchen. The seafood was wonderful. Every dish was a mouth watering experience. The staff were wonderful, the food is worth a trip to Cyprus for, I will most certainly be returning.I do have one compliant, I can no longer fit into my clothes, the wonderful stretched my waiste line.I encourage anyone to try this mouth watering experience, 100% satisfied.",Zanettos
50,"This eating experience is the real thing! Zanettos has been in Nicosia since 1938 and it's still going strong. I would rate it as an essential experience for anyone who wants to know what ""meze"" is really all about. There is no Menu as such - just a lot of delicious dishes brought one after another, in what is considered the right order, until you are truly fit to bust - and then they bring some more! Go prepared for a long evening, with a group of friends, and just relax and enjoy the whole experience. It looks like nothing from the outside, but that appearance is certainly deceptive. Not to be missed, if you're ever in Nicosia!",Zanettos
40,"We decided to try another tavern while in Nicosia (usually we go to Engomi)So we tried the mezze at ZanettosIt's very very good (and even too much, which is a pity)We loved it and we'll return when we'll be back in Nicosia, for sureNice food , wine and serviceMerci beaucoupThanks to the chief and all the staff(maybe could you propose ""mini"" mezzes, with less items, cheaper, and people should be able to finish !!)Our dinertuesday 22nd oct",Zanettos
50,"As others have said, the entrance to this restaurant is deceptive. It opens out into quite a large area but still gets very crowded. The challenge with the meze is to keep bringing food (which was all delicious) until you can't possibly eat anything else and then still try to entice you with something like the odd snail or two! It's not the sort of place you would probably just come across in wandering round the streets of the old town but it's really worth seeking out. They will package up whatever you don't eat and the remains might keep you going for the rest of the week. Not cheap but very good value.",Zanettos
40,"Don't be fooled by the front of the restaurant. A small opening, but this restaurant, in the heart of the old town, has a great meat meze. Similar to Spanish tapas, a meat or fish meze is typical for Cyprus.Once inside, there's more space than you'd initially think there is. The food is of excellent quality AND taste. Very friendly service and a great patio at the back. A simple restaurant with great food.",Zanettos
50,Liked everything from the food to the price. Went with friends one night and brought other friends the following night,Zanettos
40,"A group of us, including guests from out-of-town, headed to Zanettos on a Friday night. At 9pm it was half full, but soon it was packed - proof that the quality (and unfortunately prices) have remained up to the usual high standards. As usual, the owner was milling around, making sure the guests were entertained and happy. There was a big time gap half way throught he meal, and the guests were not prepared for ""round 2"". No-one was able to finish things off, and it seemed sucha waste! We washed down the meze with an excellent xynisteri from the Zambartas winery. Overall a great night out.",Zanettos
50,"Fantastic plentiful food. Excellent service. The very reasonable price includes sweet, fruit and desert with coffee. Do not miss but go hungry. Also nice little touches like ros√© water hand rinse on arrival to welcome you. Note that the default assumption is that you a re having a mezze, this is not an a la carte restaurant but a very authentic Cypriot mezzo taverna.",Zanettos
40,"When I came to Zanettos I was surprised that there is no regular menu. Instead of that you 'll get a list of food which will be server for you for 20Euro/person (+drinks). As there is a lot to try (you'll get over a dozen different dishes) don'teat much at the beginning because your food will came for over half an hour, every time something different. And after you are full and you start to beg waiters to stop coming with new plates you must be aware that there are also deserts (yes, plural) after you stop eating main courses :)You will more roll out of the restaurant instead of go out :)Food is very good but it's to much. Don't go there if you are not hungry and you want to get only small salad.",Zanettos
40,"We found it in the middle of the old town, very difficult to find a parking space, we arrived around 8pm and the place was nearly empty, but it soon filled up and became very lively and eventually we realised why, they serve the finest Cyprus mezze and the food was tasty and just kept coming, the chef came out of the kitchen and asked if we wanted more, excellent.",Zanettos
40,"really good greek tabern with very friendly owner. We had ""messe"" which means everything possible including wine etc for reasonable price.The pita bread is magnific with all sorts of tajine, tzaziki, rice with spinach, grill meat (all varieties) but on top of everything what i like the most was the haloumi. Normally it is rather salty but here it melted in my mouth.Great atmosphere and good value for food",Zanettos
50,"I have been to this taverna 3 times, and the food is amazing and great value for money. You have to try their house wine which is the best! Staff are friendly and I will always go back.",Zanettos
20,"We went there after we heard that it is one of the best cypriot taverns.. The food is very good indeed but the yard that we had to sit have big walls and it is quite hot, especially during the summer. We were 4 people and one of the girls wasnt hungry so we decided to order 3 meze. However they said that we couldnt do that which is unacceptable!!!!!!! Meze is 21 euro per person which is quite expensive also. there are plenty -just as good places - much cheaper than Zanettos where you could actually order depending on how hungry you are! We will never go back to this tavern for sure!",Zanettos
50,"great dishesvery good servicepanagiotis and the stuff are great and very friendly, the food is very goodthe spot of the town is very good and for sure u will fell happy leaving this placetry the spanakorizo , karaolous and dont miss for desert the mahallepithere are some great wines from cyprus and greeceat the end try cyprus coffe",Zanettos
50,I had a dinner with fantastic fresh local food.Prices are really low compared the number of plates offered. Local Wine eccellent. Service meticoulus. Nice experience.,Zanettos
50,"Zanettos tavern, under Panagiotis Mentzis direction, is a typical authentic cyprian tavern in the Nicosia city center. It is the second time we visited Cyprus and Zanettos is our loved place to taste the local cuisine. Friendly, fast and happy staff. Special ""meze"" dishes, that are served in a certain dish flow, as you do not have to order them. It is true that food is too much! It was a pity that we were not able to handle with all that delicious food... Have a look at the kitchen, through the open door, and you will realize yourself the quality and freshness of the food and the fair preparation.",Zanettos
40,"Is a typical Cyprus Tavern, located in the old part of Nicosia near Archbishop's Palace and omerie hamam.Usualy crowded, especially on Fridays and Saturdays, noisy as mostly preffered by Cypriots, with good Cyprus Meze plenty and in good prices.It's better to make a reservation, before and be sure that you are really hungry.Is ideal for families.",Zanettos
40,A traditional tavern located in the old city of Nicosia and offers a variety of authentic dishes from Cyprus. We visited Zanettos twice and both nights it was almost full.Dishes are delicious but there is so ‚Ä¶ so much ‚Ä¶food !!!I am sure you can‚Äôt eat everything even though you are really starving.D√©cor is very interesting and the staff very friendly. Reasonable prices. It is place you must visit once you are in NICOSIA,Zanettos
50,"On arrival I joined Owner Pete at a table opposite the restaurant. Arriving early, we connected, shared a glass of Commanderia, discussed Meze (his speciality), MBA's (we are both qualified), teased each other mercilessly over our smartphones (his Samsung) and mine (iPhone 5). I lost and had to make coffee. I the instructed him to cook dinner and take photos with his phone. Dinner was excellent. Still waiting for the photos, Pete. ;-)",Zanettos
40,This place is located in the old city of Nicosia and offers authentic meze. It is worth coming here if you want to try traditional Cypriot food and if you want to see a bit of the old town. Prices are average but the food keeps on coming!,Zanettos
40,"Very good cousine,reasonable prices,four meze with ,bottle of wine ,deserts about 110 euros, Many dishes you must go hungry no good as expected by the reviews but to be honest very good quality. Nice polite service. Recommended...",Zanettos
50,"I have been going to Zanettos for years and make a point of taking any guests and visitors I have there at least once, be it friends, family or colleagues.It's very simple. Book early, go hungry and make an evening out of it because a quick meal this is not. There is no menu (that I know of), just meze, and it will never end. Seriously. Service is friendly and reasonably fast (we are in the Med after all), the place itself is cozy and I have never been disappointed. Last time I was there with a group of 20 people, and everything went as smoothly as it has gone when visiting with a lot smaller groups.To be fair the food is not extraordinary, but it is very good and consistent. There is so much of too that even if you are a veggie or do not eat pork, you will still have plenty to eat. A must experience in Nicosia.",Zanettos
50,"Is by far the best place for Local Cypriot cuisin in Nicossia.... Is so famous that you can not miss it. Although it may look small on the outside the place is roomy and has a nice back yard. TOP chefs offer great treats of the local cuisine at good prices. Try the Mezedes, where a course of 20 (!!!!!) dishes will make you more than full. Ther is nothing to be said for the dishes but to describe them as the epitomi of the local cuisne. The wall are full of celebrities posing with the chef, from greek singers to almost all the tv stars..DO NOT MISS",Zanettos
50,food is great with a variety of dishes and service is good. Great value for money and is one of the places that none will be dissapointed,Zanettos
40,"One should go hungry to this place, as the series of plates arriving at your table seems to have no end. Do not eat too much in the first dishes, or the pitta with dips, so there is space for the later dishes, including ravioli with halloumi cheese, snails with onions, loukaniko (cypriot sausage), sheftalia (pork meatballs) and several other cypriot delicacies. Service is usually ok, but this restaurant can get very busy and loud, and there is a tendency to put tables very near each other. People also smoke in the terrace, where you may end up sitting, so bear that in mind.",Zanettos
40,"I was taken here by a local, and, well, wow. Like every other review, let me warn you about the quantity of food. It's nuts. I understand that the culture is different -- if you cleaned your plate, they didn't do their job -- but that can be a hard habit to break. The food was overall good quality. Some of the items were a little greasy, but that could have just been my stomach after several days of living high on the hog.",Zanettos
50,"You'll need to be rolled out of there! Everyone gets the same thing, meze, which is plate after plate after plate of food that is brought I'm succession. There's no way you can finish everything so pace yourself and don't gobble up the first courses. Everyone pays the same price for meze but its twice the price of other restaurants. I loved it but if you want a cheaper meze go to ""To Steki tis Loxandras""! Better part of town, easier to find, half the price and AWESOME! Get reservations at both spots if eating at 8 or 9. No problem at 7 pm in December. As good as Zanettos is, don't feel like you're missing anything by choosing To Steki...",Zanettos
20,"Funny typical greek taverna. But the joy is going down when you face the horrible waitress who is wondering when she will finish her service, and the strange customers around you. Obviously only for regular ones.Too much food, it¬¥s a shame...",Zanettos
40,"Excellent choice of wine, excellent service, TOO MUCH FOOD and all these in an environment that takes you decades back.",Zanettos
30,I have only been once to Zanettos. The locals love it because you get lots of food for a reasonable price. Because of its popularity it is very full (too full) at times,Zanettos
50,"Authentic Cypriot food, very generous portions and polite staff who can speak fluent Greek - such a rarity in Cyprus unfortunately. Although it may seem a tad expensive considering the prices of other taverns, you really get what you pay for; I don't know any other tavern who can compare both in the quality and the quantity of the food at Zannetos. Highly recommended and don't forget to make a reservation.",Zanettos
40,"A bit off the beaten track but well presented and personable restaurant that is very popular with the locals (one local we spoke to seemed surprised - and almost upset - that we found it). Approach is simple - just eat what they give you, a large quantity of cold and hot mezze. Quantities are very generous and challenging if you feel like you should clear the table.A wide selection was available but better for meat eaters as the choice was a bit more restricted for vegetarians.Service is casual as there's a sense that locals tend to want to relax and take their time eating. But helpful and friendly when needed.",Zanettos
30,Having visiting cyprys often i like to try cypriot cuisine this tavern has many cooked food(caserole) and not much grilled food the dishes were luck of taste and texture very pricy considering other nearby taverns,Zanettos
40,"One of the most wonderfull tavernas in town. Overall friendly, welcoming, and amazing food could not ask for more. Thanks.",Zanettos
40,"Very good food at abundant portions. They only serve mezze so one tip: you can always order for less people than those present, e.g. if there are 4 of out, order for 3 people. It is common practice in Cyprus. Otherwise you can always ask for bring the rest back home with you.",Zanettos
50,"Traditional food at great quality, variety and prices. Great atmosphere too. Serves mezedEs many plates to try a bit of everything. Nice selection of wines too.",Zanettos
30,"No difference between food from supermarket and served in this tavern. Not very well cooked. Meat meze and fish meze NEVER should be mixed. Their meze is created for the tourists, and the price is high. NOT RECOMMENDED",Zanettos
50,"This tavern offers local food, at local prices with a typical Cypriot atmosphere. Highly recommended by myself who lives here!",Zanettos
50,"What a great restaurant! My friends and I had a fab evening there. You pay 21 euro for a set menu. There was so much food! They bring little salads to start, then stuffed vine leaves, meats, sea food , snails etc.etc! So much food! We had to be rolled home at the end. The place has a lively atmosphere and the waiters are very friendly.I would have been happy with half the quantity, but it made for a fun evening.",Zanettos
50,Visited Zanettos again after many many years and happy I did. Food is still as good as I remember and service was friendly and efficient.,Zanettos
30,This is a traditional Cypriot tavern where locals used to go and enjoy good food. Now it‚Äôs a bid commercial where mass of people go there and eat.,Zanettos
40,Very nice and friendly place but they need to improve his food to keep the big reputation,Zanettos
50,"The best meze we had in cyprus without a doubt, really worth a visit. Dont even attempt to eat everything- you'll never manage it!",Zanettos
50,"Fixed menu (21Eu in May 2012), decent wine at 12Eu for a bottle and the food just kept coming and coming. It was all excellent, just pace yourself !",Zanettos
40,"I liked this place.As usual in Cyprus you get large and varied portions, vegetarian food is served separately on request and is not as varied as meat but is nice and certainly enough to fill you up!The only major down side is that the fully enclosed ""outside"" area has four walls and a roof and allows smoking. This does make the restaurant poorer, especially if you are in this area. This is why I gave 3 for atmosphere. 4 plus otherwise.But, if you wan authentic Cyprus mezze, go here!!",Zanettos
50,"Small tavern, good food. I liked the welcoming shots with traditional cypriot drinks (kumantaria liquer and zivania spirit).",Zanettos
40,"The Zannetos Tavern had the reputation as the best Tavern in Nicosia. With these expectation you expect good quality food,good service and etc.However in busy days the restaurant is just average. The food portions aren't always the same as the number of plates. The plates are tasty but most time you find only grill plates in comparison with some other taverns. If you find them in a good day you will be vary Lucky and eat very well.!!",Zanettos
50,"We have been there several times. The people there know how to treat people as they are very proffecionals. They welcome you with a traditional Cypriot way and as soon as you are there they make you feel at home. They are always there if you need something,and you don't have to wait for hours.. The food is very very tasty and you can feel that the igridiences they use are really fresh.. Defenately I will go there again and again especially if I have friends or relatives from abroad!After all is the little things that make the difference..",Zanettos
50,A nice meze treat in the old town of Nicosia. I didn't like the small space to tell you the truth and the lack of parking but the good service and food are tasteful and really made my evening. All the walls are decorated with pictures of famous singers and actors that have visited the place.,Zanettos
40,"Go for the meze, it includes almost everything, from veg dishes to meat. Flavours are pretty traditional, as they should for this kind of restaurant. If you're in town, go there!",Zanettos
50,"Over the years Zanettos has built a solid reputation for its food and service. This restaurant is a must for anyone visiting Nicosia and wants to taste the notorious endless feast of meze. This is typically not a quiet night out, and Zanettos keeps a very true air of authenticity in their establishment. Just order meze (if you're 4 people just order 'for 4') some drinks and let the friendly waiters start bringing over the food.Be prepared : Go hungry as the meze entails a lot of dishes (all killers, no fillers)! The friendly owner will unavoidably check with your table at least once to ensure everything is ok. Perfect spot for a night out with friends, you'll leave with a smile on your face.",Zanettos
40,If your looking for a meze that's truly authentic albeit a little rough around this place is critical to visit. Its old city location gives it that feel of realism that other establishments in nicosia lack,Zanettos
50,"Great Cyprus food,Very nice Environment , reasonable prices",Zanettos
40,"Unless you are prepared to follow suit with the cheff do not eat at this place; give him the go ahead for everything, you will not regret it.",Zanettos
30,"While the food is certainly not bad, it's simply typical meze that you can find pretty much anywhere. There is no particular stand out dish. The service is great and we'd certainly go back again!",Zanettos
40,"Nice place,small yet is packed with tables which makes you feel uncomfortable and difficult to enjoy ur food.food is lovely and value for money",Zanettos
50,A real taste of Cypriot food. Its one of the most popular taverns in town.,Zanettos
30,"nothing special-one of those places in cyprus were u get 100 dishes, u eat one third, and of those half are not worth it....",Zanettos
50,"Your order is only the drinks -we had red open wine that was very good. We had at least 15 different plates with food (meze) and we really enjoyed the taste and the quality of what they served us. At the end they bring sweets,fruits,coffee all in a price. We payed 60 Euro for 2 people and all peple there were very friendly",Zanettos
50,"Delicious food, excellent service, great quality and big variety make this restaurant the best of its kind in Nicosia.We visited it last night and we felt the different atmosphere and the nice mood that exists in this ""taverna"".Very traditional, full of Cypriots and Greeks, that enjoyed the good food at the back yard.A must-go place !!! Strongly recommended !!The price for the big variety of mezedes that was server to us was 21 euros per person, quite reasonable price given the quantity and variety.",Zanettos
50,This is probably one of the best eateries in old Nicosia. The only thing you need to choose are the drinks! A set meze menu is the only food option and be prepared for huge amounts of traditional Cypriot food. Grilled meats were our favorite dish.,Zanettos
50,"There exist only one menu composed from traditional ""meze"" selected by the owner. Not only the food was of very good quality, but includes an enormous number of authentic flavors and fresh prepared dishes and salads, all coming for the same price. The only suggestion is to eat slowly and enjoy the tastes !! The price was below 30 euro per person (including drinks), but it was worth it !! Nice atmosphere, friendly service and you can take the menu with all restaurant's history (from 1938) with you ....",Zanettos
50,"Been there with friends and had the full meze. Not only the food was very good, but by the end of the night we couldn‚Äôt breathe from eating too much. My only suggestion is to go there really hungry!! The price was around 30-35 euro per person (including drinks), but it was worth it!! Make sure you have a reservation because this place is always packed!",Zanettos
50,"One of the oldest surviving restaurants in Nicosia (apparently going since 1938), this place is quite difficult to locate. Although I have been half a dozen times, I still get lost. It is hidden away in the narrow streets of the old city.The restaurant is housed in a converted old house with a courtyard and several rooms that intercommunicate. The courtyard is open and available for outside seating in the summer months.The cuisine is unquestionably Cypriot. Both in selection and in volume. For less than ‚Ç¨20 you can eat a meze to your heart's content. Meze is in fact the only option on the menu, comprising of local dishes and a good serving of grilled meat. Vegetarians might feel a bit neglected. Service is rushed in keeping with a canteen-style restaurant. The owner, an overweight, bearded character often flips between tables. Most of the client√®le is local but English is spoke.Be warned, you need to arrive hungry here.",Zanettos
40,"Mostly griiled food, local drinks smiling staff, overall easy going place",Zanettos
