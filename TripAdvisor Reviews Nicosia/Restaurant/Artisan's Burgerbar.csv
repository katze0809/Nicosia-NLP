40,Located in Nicosia. You can find make almost your own burger with serval options available and also they served other plates and different kind of salads. The service was good and the waitress was friendly. The burger with gruyere cheese and onion was tasty and juicy. We paid around 16 euros per person including soft drink. The side fried sweet potatoes were delicious. Nice place for burgers but not real good atmosphere. Good for lunch mainly.,Artisan's Burgerbar
20,Wrong cooking of the burger Salty salad medium service The Quality for the dishes not acceptable with the prices The burgers was ordered medium and become well done and dry It was a bad experience First and last time in this place,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was crunchy and well cooked however the ban seemed n fresh. The French fries was tasty. Overall price was 9 euro including drinks.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,not really that good. Quite expensive for what you are eating and the service is quite poor considering that we had to ask twice for certain things,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Nice place very good food but a bit pricy. Lovely environment. Very good service. Polite and helpful!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Being a vegetarian doesn't mean you can't enjoy juicy burgers! The veggie burger at Artisan's is yummy and I highly recommend it. Make sure you try their homemade sweet potato and parsnip crisps, too!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Not the first time causing this place and always they delay to serve on time. The chicken burger with garlic mushroom sauce was tasty and the sweet potatoes were delicious. I paid around 16 euros including the soft drink. The atmosphere is not so alive but the food is good.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Excellent choice of burgers with a choice of bread, sauce and side dishes! Friendly staff, cosy atmosphere. Highly recommended. Good prices!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I have not visited this place in over a year. We normally had burgers and they were fine, a good burger (better than most places), but also get good burgers in most sports bars now. The waiter suggested the sirloin stake - which i accepted. He was right, it is possibly the best steak i have tried in Cyprus.Cooked to perfect medium, the pepper sauce was just right and taste was fantastic.We were there with teenagers and a child, everyone found something to eat, and enjoyed it. Service was friendly and prompt, the place was good temp, and had a good ambiance to it. Drinks to cater for all, and had an extensive menu so wide variety - worth another visit!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,By far the best burgers in Cyprus. Meat quality is excellent. Service is great. Go when its quiet. Finally a place that knows what a burger should taste like. Would pay whatever they charge because its worth it.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Lunch menu normally should be served fast... which is not the case. I wait several times more than 30 min for a sandwich or a salad ... by the way the cease chicken sandwich was ok but it will be better if the cheese was melted and the bread toasted.... the service was slow. Average price was 10 euro including coke and sweet potatoes fries.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Words cannot describe the taste of the burgers. Had dinner on a Saturday evening - but also use this restaurant for take away. Totally satisfied. The staff are kind and very service orientated.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"They changed their menu and includes more variety of foods such as salads, sandwiches, meet and chicken and even fish as well as different variety of burgers. Nice place to visit and the service was good. The chicken salad was tasty and it was only at 9 euro including soft drink!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Been many times for the burgers which are possibly the best in cyprus and worth the price! In fact i would pay 50euro for such an amazing burger. However be warned if you visit during a busy time it seems the quality drops drastically. We waited a long time for the food and the burgers were not half as good and previous times both by taste and presentation.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and quite nice food. The staff were very helpful especially since i was pregnant and could not eat a lot of things, they made me plain chicken fillet like requested which was different from the menu.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"Went there with friends for my birthday meal, nice restaurant, friendly staff but way too expensive for what you get. We expected far bigger burgers for the price we paid.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Easily the best burgers in Cyprus. Wide variety of combinations, top quality meat, always cooked to your preference, with amazing service and atmosphere.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Probably one of the BEST burgers i had in Cyprus. Very nice cook, fresh ingredients, fast service, great place and atmosphere. My burger was great and I couldn’t ask for more.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,Been here once with my spouse. The place is nice same as the food. Staff was friendly and the food came on time. The prices on the other hand are a bit high compared to what you get.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"friendly staff, excellent food, nice ambiance and all in accessible easily at the city centrei have tried almost every burger of the joint and all the sides, the crisps are my absolute favouriteevery single burger i have ever had is tasty juicy and cooked perfectly at mediumthe staff always try to accommodate any special needs or requests and the food is served within reasonable timeperfect for a lazy sunday lunch over a cold drink",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"I tried Artisans burgers two times. Burgers are okay but definitely not the best Nicosia has to offer. I can think of other places with better burgers. However given the many positive reviews for this place, I might was unlucky or could be a matter of taste and subjectivity.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Artisan Burger bar is probably the most delicious burger you can have in Nicosia, Cyprus. They have fresh ingredients, not to mention, they offer wide choice of selection, upon your desires.... I did like the beef and their bun, But honestly, I didn't find french fries nor the sauces that much tasteful..... And one thing that you must order after the burger as sweets, is their french macarons with ice cream based on your preferences.....",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We have once again visited this restaurant with friends to enjoy a nice dinner. The food was very good as always and the staff was very friendly and the service very good.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,This is not the first time we go to Artisan's. I feel it deserves five stars and more... Same good quality as always. Keep up the good work!! Thank you.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Best burgers in Nicosia! Good food and decent choice of diverse burger combinations. (Even for vegetarians 😅). Service fine too.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,The seared foie gras was extremely and well presented. The Halloumi salad was huge but it was not as good as expected. Two soft drinks and it totalled €33.90 which was OK. Service was friendly.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,A burger joint that lived up to expectation as advertised. Late reservation on a Saturday nite was successful. Service was excellent and the food came in no time at all. Fig and goat cheese salad was very good and plentiful enough for two hungry people. Burgers are prepared only up to medium cooking and came in a large size. Could not continue to desserts cause we were more than full. Highly recommended. We were in and out in less than 1 hour. The secret I guess is to go in early. Try it and you won't be disappointed.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,Well cooked burgers Average dishes Nice environment Average prices It’s in the center on nicosia Parking around is ok if you drive there,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"As I mention in the title, the staff was extremely polite and the food came fast.But apart from that, the quality and presentation of the burgers was quite disappointing.First and foremost, the meat was evidently not of good quality. This goes both for beef and chicken. In fact, my girlfriend didn't manage to finish her dish. Secondly, the buns were not warm and didn't feel fresh. Thirdly, the sauces felt very ready-made. Lastly, the whole thing was very wet and messy and difficult to eat.So all in all, I wouldn't recommend this place for its burger, particularly because you can find better burgers for the same or better price in Nicosia.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"I ve been many times but last time I got disappointed on the food and I dont know if chef changed, also sad that veggie burgers are fried, c´mon guys, if a health conscious person dont want to eat meat he has to eat fried?? Service was good as always but for the price which charge extra even the fries could be better and bigger",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Great beetroot burger oven baked. A delicious and a healthy option for vegetarians looking after their eating habits.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"We visited for first time the Artisan's Burgerbar two weeks ago on a Sunday night for a casual dinner.The personnel was very good and friendly. Relaxing and romantic atmosfera. Their menu has the biggest and the most interesting choice of burgers I have ever seen and the taste of the burgers we tried was beyond amazing.Furthermore, we tried a new for us and produced in Dali, Cyprus beer with an amazing taste, which was recommended by the waiters.This place will be our number one for burger and for a nice and relaxing dinner.A big thank you for the whole team.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Probably the best burgers in town, top quality ingredients and friendly staff! High variety of dishes (fish and vegan options, healthy salads), nice environment and amazing service. Creative menu, delicious food worthing every penny! A really must try!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,It's a really modern and very good looking restaurant. I must say that the Burgers it serves are really good and are not just a typical burger. Very good place to visit.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"It’s not the best, neither the worst burger you can eat. There are some unique burgers to choose from, nice fries and starters. The burgers are good, however it’s not the burger you will remember the day after you eat it.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,The burger was juicy and tasty and the bun tender. It is interesting since you have large variety of choices how you like your burger. The pricing comparing to other places is relatively high but the quality of meet is good.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"I am a massive burger fan and as much excited I was when I'd first eaten here, it was quite the opposite when I went there a week ago. Mediocre taste even-though the service was really good with friendly and very helpful stuff",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Burgers.. Venue.. Staff... All very Good!!!! Plesant surprise with different tastes!!!! Will again for sure!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,It is modern restaurants offering mainly burgers with few other dishes. The shrimp burger was spicy and tasty and the chips was delicious. The waiter was very polite but the service somehow was relatively slow. In general was good. To try it.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Probably the best burger place in Nicosia. A bit pricey but you get what you pay. A good variety of ingredients and side dishes. Also nice atmosphere,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,They served mainly burgers ... the burger was juicy and tasty and the fries amazing ... you can chose and make your own burger too. The service was just ok.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"These burgers are LIFE! clean and delicious, artisanal burgers you'll come back for again and again. with great, friendly staff, many delicious options in burgers, buns, side-orders etc this place is the king of burgers <3",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,A round of applause please to whomever made that menu. Damn man. I just don’t know every time! “Which one? Which one?” They all sound amazing! My brain splits into 20 different slices just to imagine the flavours.Really! I cant specify enough how many different types of burgers there are.My words will be short but clear this time. “Pick anything you feel like! It will be good if not great”,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,A place where you can have a variety of alternative burgers. Every burger is serve with a choice of side dish. Reasonable prices...quick service Excellent staff,Artisan's Burgerbar

50,I had the shrimp burger and it was really good! Friendly staff and a nice place. The barbecue sauce is very good too!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Excellent burgers, surely best in town!Choice of two type of buns, brioche or multigrain whole wheat. Juicy, big beef patties cooked to nice medium. Sauces and dips are tasty and spicier than normal for an island that is lethally afraid of any spices other than salt and pepper.Fries are also tastier than usual in Cyprus, crispy and nicely spiced.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,I have been visiting this Burger Place since it opened and it has been constantly good.A good selection of burgers with some creative toppings... The meat quality is good compared to all the other stuff you get around town... The only place which beats this Burger Joint is Burger Lab in Limassol...,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We loved the burgers and the service was great! We found the restaurant on trip advisor and it didn't stir us wrong.,Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"We waited 45 minutes for our food!!! Other tables that arrived after us got served the food before us, and when we did get our food half of us received our dishes, and had to wait 5 minutes until the others on our table had there dishes! We were told that the veggie burger could not be grilled and only fried 30 minutes after the waitress had taken our order and told us that it could be grilled! Salmon burger was very dry without any sauce and just in a bun! Do not recommend when it is busy as we had a very long wait..which was not acceptable as we had 2 young children with us. It would have been a great idea to bring some bread or fries for the kids due to such a long wait!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,My cousin introduced us to this new place. Im glad she did because I won’t go anywhere else. I love their homemade burgers and also their veggie burger is delish too! Their home made honey and mustard has its own taste that will drive you insane! Love it love it. And staff are super friendly. Thanks guys!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"We absolutely love artisan's!! Perfectly cooked burgers and tasty! Its our to go burger bar! Great staff, always offer the best service!! Strongly rec!",Artisan's Burgerbar

40,Had a medium cooked beef burger with cheese topping. Absolutely filling and juicy and fresh! Entrees were excellent. Great atmosphere.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"We both wanted to have chicken burgers, but they informed us that there was only one chicken burger left, so my husband had the beef which was very average compared to its price. My chicken burger was nice though. Service was good.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Great burger, great entrees, great service!The place was packed with people (we ate lunch there) but the service was really good! We took the fried zucchini & fried halumi cheese- this was the best halumi dish we ate in Cyprus!We took 2 burgers and they were great!I really recommend not to miss this place! It's a walking distance from the bus station and the old city",Artisan's Burgerbar
10,"Saturday night and the place is busy, but we were still able to get a table. Sadly thats all we got. Twenty minutes went by and while there were clearly enough staff on duty, we hadn't even been offered a drink. The final straw was when two other tables, both of whom had arrived at least 10 minutes after us, were served almost immediately. Avoid if you are hungry or if you like to feel like a valued customer.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I have visited the place many times but I hadn't been there for a while. I usually I order signature beefburger number 4: ""fresh mozzarella cheese, tomato, homemade basil pesto and baby rucola leaves"". This time I wasn't into beefburger (too much beef during the previous days) so I decided to try the ""chicken burger with wild mushroom sauce, portobello mushroom, juicy ripe tomatoes with a fresh onion slice and mixed greens"". It was simply amazing. Moreover, I has some of my kid's grilled chicken breast which was very juicy and very tasty. Combined with a friendly service, the night was excellent. Will certainly keep visiting.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,The burgers at Artisan's Burgerbar were fantastic! I had the blue cheese and fig burger and my boyfriend had the mushroom burger and we both were very satisfied. The Onion rings were also absolutely fantastic. Will definitely go again.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Visited numerous times usually for some after work action. The restaurant offers very good service and a nice variety of quality burgers. The beer selection is fine and so is the wine list.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Excellent recipes , excellent burgers , excellent sauce and potatoes! Very good staff and too many choices of burgers!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"This place is amazing,the burgers are so good and there is a very big variety of different toppings.A very big plus point is also, that you can add or remove toppings and make your custom burger in some way. They also have great desserts.Service is very friendly.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"We chose this place because of the reviews here and we were not disappointed. Nice attentive staff, good ambiance with candles on the tables after dark, great selection of burgers with reasonable quality/price ratio.Portions are very decent, portobello mushrooms as appetizer are to die for and very nice paired with Moschofilero. The burgers we had were delicious, I suggest you take the adventurous path and try whatever house specials they have. I was pleasantly surprised when the waitress asked if we wanted a regular bun or whole grain - we ordered the latter and we found it tastier than the regular white ones which we normally leave untouched.Special thanks goes to very attentive waiting/bussing staff which made sure we finished the appetizer before bringing the main dish - we could take our time and savor every bite.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Went there for a birthday dinner, from the beginning the manager was very nice and helpful. He offered a candle service and helped me to keep it a surprise for my husband. I ordered a chicken burger which was delicious, had half of it and I was full. My husband ordered a beef burger and end up liking the chicken one more for the first time ever:) The chocolate souffle was lovely as well and in general we had a very nice experience.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Absolutely superb. Fantastic meal,great service. Both of burgers tasted great and cooked to perfection, staff were very attentive and polite. A real hot shot in the centre of town !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,Well prepared burgers and salads and tasteful surroundings. Wide selection of burgers. Rather slow service though.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Good portions. Good environment. Good service :) delicious burgers with interesting combinations.......,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"We went to the Artisans after reading some very good comments, food was ok but nothing special, we enjoyed some cocktails that were very good.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Once again we visited this restaurant to enjoy a meal of burgers and salads. Service and quality food is always available here.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We went to artisan's on multiple occasions and we tried almost half of their burgers! All of them were carefully cooked and delicious! The sides are also really nice! Personal favourite: burger number 2 and mashed potatoes!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Excellent burgers must try the potatoes with cheese and chill sauce its a must for me ! Just give it a try,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I had one of the best burgers I have ever tried at Artizan's Burgerbar. Reasonable prices, nice service, friendly staff, enjoyable atmosphere. Would definitely visit again.",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"I visited this place with my wife and kids, and everybody were very excited to try their famous burgers. unfortunately, we have not given any chance, since for 35 minutes no one has even took our order. i don't mean bringing it, but at least ask what we would want to have. i cannot say they were lack of waiters - i noticed 4 or 5 people serving tables around us. even when i caught one and asked when we may a place an order he just disappeared. so we waited for 10 more minutes and just left. guys, your management is awful. you are selling not a food ( i can do it myself, or buy at supermarket), you are selling a SERVICE. and you don't have one. thank you for spoiling my birthday.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Don't be distracted by the word 'burgerbar' as this is a superb restaurant offering a wide range of fantastic burgers, beautifully served with a variety of toppings. Melted French cheese and relishes can accompany the burger with a variety of buns, some whole meal. Artisan's signature French fries are just as good as their burgers and the ice cream burger promises a satisfying dessert. The decor is equally splendid and minimalistic with comfortable chairs. usually very busy so reserving is advisable.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Excellent bergers and very friendly waitress, little expensive but its worth it for the quality of the food. Very good service",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"As you can see from my previous review I was very happy with the burger. The last time I ordered burger for delivery at home. The burger was disappointing. Although the bread was warm the burger inside was not warm but almost cold. Also although I asked the burgers to be medium cooked, it was medium rare cooked. Unfortunately, we did not manage to eat the burgers.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Love the burgers there!! Wings are quite nice and the stuffed mushrooms are the bomb! Must try the blue cheese burger with sun-dried figs,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Artisan's Burger Restaurant is one of the sure places to go for a burger. Whatever you order it will be sure that you'll enjoy it. Some times service is not that fast due to lots of customers eating at the same time but at the end you'll have your burger in style. My personal opinion is that the prices are overestimated in this place but of course once you choose to go there for lunch/dinner you have decided that price is not an object.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,A wide variety of burgers and all the assortments for them. Tasty salads. Fusion vibe. Rich wine selection. Waiters know their stuff. Reasonable prices. Unmistakable service.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Best burger I've had in a long time. Definitely best in Cyprus! Good service, helpful and polite staff, friendly and clean atmosphere, out of this world quality burger!! Keep it up guys, will definitely visit again soon!! Kind of pricey but worth for a once in a while visit. Also, sharper knives needed!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"We enjoyed our dinner very much! Nice food, ok atmosphere good and polite staff and good company! I could easily recommend it!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Probably. I would compare it with American burgers. I would prefer if they were 100% angus beef but Oh well...nobody is perfect. Worth a visit at least.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,A nice place with good quality burgers cooked properly and with various options. The taste factor is excellent,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Even though we did not book a table they were still very polite and organised a table for us immediately. Their readiness to service their customers is unique.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Me and my family went with a group of friends and were very Impressed with the restaurant as a whole.great service and excellent burgers.i read a few others reviews that said the burgers were to expensive, its true most plates are between 10 and 15 euro, however u get what you pay for, this is not McDonald's! There is no way you will leave hungry, the burgers were huge and very tasty! Will come again",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I really like the combinations of the burger options. Not your typical burger, cheese, tomato, lettuce. It has a variety of choices. One of the best I have tried.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,The last two years I visit this place once a week .Is always nice to visit this premises as you are sure to find the best standard quality with big variety and excellent side dishes.The service is unique and professional staff.,Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"My previous review of Artisan's was glowing. Unfortunately, now the novelty has worn off, I have to address some shortcomings. We visited yesterday, a party of 3, ordering two chicken burgers with guacamole and one veggie burger and delicious (because cheese) portobello mushrooms for appetizer. The veggie burger looked too black, as if it was fried, and was merely unappetizing. The chicken burger was dry, only saved by the guacamole texture (but not flavor), which might as well be store bought. We wanted to get a jacket potato as a side, but for the 4th consecutive visit were denied, since it is the ""only"" thing on the menu they don't have. When you don't have something for 4 visits, please take it off the menu. When we asked what red wine they had, they didn't bring out a menu, but told us the name of two wines, a French and a Cypriot. I asked again what kind of wines those are, and got again the names of the wineries. The Cypriot wine ended up being another variety than that we were quoted (cheaper and lower quality), so we ordered the French, which was a Merlot. Now who likes Merlot? The choices were minimal, either cheap Cypriot Cabernet Sauvignon, or French Merlot. I tend to like their Beef Burgers, but this time I went for the healthy choices, and it was not worth it. Also a decent wine menu would greatly improve our wine choosing experience. I want to like this joint, but yesterday's experience was particularly eye-opening. I'd better stick to the beef burgers next time.",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"I visited about a month ago with friends. Nothing special about it, or the food which was overcooked and the beers which were overpriced with poor selection.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"Artisan is a good place to have burger, it does not taste like other ""fast food burgers"" you can feel the quality of cheese and ingredients in it, however I find it overpriced.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"nice place nice food, as in all cyprus expensive, maybe is the best burger in cyprus but compared to usa is 5 times more expensive",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"I was expecting an amazing burger to be honest based on the reviews on trip advisor so we visit the place with some friends.My burger was ok, cooked as i ordered but wasn't anything special, maybe my expectations was higher.A very average burger with an overestimated price.Don't really mind to pay €15 for a burger as long a stay satisfied but this burger wasn't anything special.Too bad because i was looking forward to visit the place.Staff 8/10Price 5/10Burger 6/10Burger presentation 4/10",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"I don't really like burgers that much, but I was disappointed that the burgers weren't better. Too rich and bloating.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"First, let me begin with the service. Best service I ever had! Secondly, because I am a burger lover I've been to several restaurants in Cyprus for burgers and I can say with confidence that this is the best. Both the service, the food and the place are the best. The owner of the shop also gave me information about calories and nutrition. A rare thing to experience in Cyprus. The taste of the meat was really good and the sauces they use are unique and taste so good. My best meal is that with the goat cheese. The fries are also very very nice! And don't forget to have the chocolate shuffle as a dessert. The plate is an art by itself. The vanilla ice cream is super premium for sure and the combination of biscuit and caramel with the ice cream and the chocolate shuffle will leave you speechless!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nice, meaty, home-made burgers. Very good appearance. Good value for money. Excellent and helpful service. Good for a quick lunch.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,We visited artisans with friends. The atmosphere and service is good. I would say prices are high and could offer more options of healthy dishes.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Artisan has a variety of burger plates. I ate a chicken burger and it was delicious. Moreover it's location it's really easy to find!,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,In Whole a good experience with great service however the only thing that let it down was the price far to expensive in my opinion,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Very good quality of burgers, good service and friendly environment. A bit expensive to be honest, but worth to try it.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I absolutely loved this burger restaurant. The place was great, new and fresh and most importantly the burger I had was mind-blowing.It's very rare that I like something but the food was delicious!I'm no food critic but I defo enjoy a great burger and I think this is the only choice for you to visit in Nicosia.The picture of the place was on my Snapchat so I didn't save it to upload it here, but you will get a better feeling when you just visit it.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Been here twice - food is great - top quality burger - some of the types are not my taste, but for the most part everything is top notch. Good service and nice atmosphere.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,A wide selection of unique burgers. Fresh and uncommon ingredients are used. The result is an amazingly tasty burger worth trying.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,very good burgers but no kectup They have other dressings which i do not like You need 15 euros to eat a nice meal and rhe decoration is lux not forburgers Good location in the centre of the town,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,located in the city centre with inside & outside seating. various dishes but mainly burgers with a variety of selections to add on top. quick service & good prices for all,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Very nice burgers in reasonable prices and a variety of beers and wines. It is more than a restaurant than fast food. Friendly staff and nice decoration. It is usually crowded so you might need a booking. One of the best places in Nicosia.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I visited a couple of times, last time was better. Service is good and the burgers are also nice. In a good location and parking available around the restaurant.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,I recently visited Artisan Burgerhouse and have to say that the food is really good. Despite the fact that it's a little expensive for a burgerhouse if you're a burger lover you should give this one a try. The service is okay but the staff is very friendly.,Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"Could have given this place 3 stars. But my wife absolutely hated the hamburger. Tasteless and too well done after ordering medium rare. My chicken burger was good.I feel the prices are way too high for what you get. And the manager's claim that they use the best ingredients just doesn't pass the smell test. I would hope they use the best ingredients. And honestly the burger did not taste anything like it was a quality burger. And though I didn't get the fries, (my wife did) they were lousy. Spending 40 euros for a couple of burgers and one beer left me feeling cheated.My suggestion. Lower the prices. Get the orders right. And stop justifying the too high prices with claims that don't add up.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"We hold on Sunday and eat here after. Just.good.burgers + good beer! Feels like a micro brewery, but actually isn't. Outdoor seating area. Lovely service. Try it. You won't regret it.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"The restaurant should do nothing with its good quality meat. Instead, it adds spices and too much salt. At least for the four Americans at our table, the burger combos were odd: mint, strong cheese, etc. Salad and fries were mediocre. OK, so it's better than fast food, but at 12 E per burger, it's a bad value.",Artisan's Burgerbar
10,"How dare this place call themselves an Artisan Burger Bar. My ""medium rare"" burger came overcooked, almost well done. The burger was plain. The toppings were not fresh. A 15 euro burger should at least be tasty and prepared as requested. Will never go back. Many other great burgers in Nicosia but this is not one of them.The service and atmosphere were great. Food awful.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,I have visited it 3 or 4 times so far and every time the quality of the food is better!! I highly recommend it! Artisan's is the best Burger bar in Nicosia!!,Artisan's Burgerbar

50,"Amazing Angus burgers at very reasonable price! Quick service, friendly people, cleanliness, nice decoration. Best place for burgers by far.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"It is nice place. Reasonably priced. It is better to ask them to cook it well, otherwise it may arrive a little raw. You may need a booking for weekend lunch if you do not want to wait. Constantinos",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nice burgers, carefully made, simple but nice decoration. All of them friendly and helpful, definitely coming back when hungry for burgeres :)",Artisan's Burgerbar

50,"One of the best burgers we've ever had! My favourite was the Haloumi Burger, which comes with a refreshing mint pesto on top. We will definitely come back again.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,The burgers and fries were totally gourmet and with genuine ingredients.Sometimes doing only one thing is the better choice for a restaurant.Of course this is not a fancy restaurant and my evaluation criteria is based upon what the restaurant proposes and his marketing...The staff was sometimes not 100% in present time.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,One of the best (if not the best) place in Nicosia to have a burger. Great selection of burgers. A bit pricey but worth the extra money.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,An ideal place not only for grown ups but also for the kids. They use good quality materials and have a wide selection of burgers. As for their sweets they compete with the best restaurants.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"The burgers are very well cooked. A great variety of side dishes. It is a bit expensive when you consider that ""it's just a burger"". If you want to spoil yourself with a nice burger, is probably the best you can find in town.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Excellent place for a burger. They also have gr8 options for vegetarians. Don't miss the fries. Highly recommended!,Artisan's Burgerbar

40,"The burger was excellent and juicy, also the sides, especially fries were yummy!!! We ordered a No.3 and a No.9, very surprising taste. Overall a good place for burgers",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,This is the only place we eat burgers out. There is a wide choice of accompaniments and you can choose a side salad instead of fries. Good beer and good service also.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,This restaurant has a very wide selection of burgers. You need to have more than one visit to explore some of them. Don't forget to make reservations beforehand otherwise you will only have a seat by the bar.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nice shot, food was really good, portions were large, plate was carefully assorted. Service was ok. Prices re fare",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I really love the burger, very tasty. Very good atmosphere but the tables was very close the one to the other. The service was a bit slow.",Artisan's Burgerbar
10,"Service was fine, but as for the quality of the food i was expecting much more than that. The burger bread was stale an you could tell they buy bread from somewhere and let it get old. Very bad choice. As for the burger we had 2 different burgers from the menu, and the taste was plain. Not worth the money we paid for.... the food looks good when they bring it to your table, but the taste was just poor and very disappointing. The salad also was not fresh. Only the fries were worth eating. I had a lot of expectations from this place but other than a good image and good service i would not recommend this place to eat. I would recommend to the management to start making their own bread for the burgers, stop buying the ready made stuff. If you are a burger place than do it and be a burger place. Make the bread fresh everyday, change the recipies and do something creative. We had 2 burgers and they tasted the same. There was nothing special to it. If you are going to charge people over 10€ for a burger than serve quality.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"One of the best, non fast food burger in Nicosia. Friendly stuff, good food, good deserts, very nice environment. Must try!",Artisan's Burgerbar

50,went there for dinner with colleagues and loved the burgers! everyone picked one burger on the menu and tried 8 of them at once. they were all delicious! will definitely go there again! highly recommended!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"The one place in Lefkosia that you can feel somebody took great pains to set up the menu - and then followed through with the actual preparation of the meals! Each burger and each dish is simply divine - you will not regret it!The ambiance is rather nice, not too elaborate and in general not distracting from your meal.It's a pity that the service on the night of my visit was sub par. The waiters seemed too busy and took to long to attend to us. I'm rather sure that this was a temporary situation.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We had a lovely time with our friends. The people were very friendly and the food was great in reasonable prices. Great!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Quaranteed quality delicious burgers! The best mash ever tasted and the unique Halloumi Tempura starter make this place one in a million and the one and only in Nicosia which i would back again and again either with the family for lunch or with friends for a nice casual dinner!,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"A bit dissapointed this time. The burger i ordered was not tasty as usual, and side dish was a bit 'heavy'.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Delicious fresh burgers and the servise is excellent. Staff very friendly. You can also make your own customized burger if you wish. Side dishes are delightfully eaten.,Artisan's Burgerbar

50,"Juicy burgers and tasty.nice place, good and friendly service. worth to visit and taste-highly recommented",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,large juicy burgers made the way you like it. large messy juicy irresistible -just the way burgers should be. Scoop it up in your hands and munch on. great place & great service.....,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nothing will be beat a good home made burger; but this place does a good job of making burgers a fine(ish) dining experience. Go there for a different type of burger, don't go expecting an old school home style burger and you won't be disappointed.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"We went to this burger bar for a quick lunch. My burger tasted very good although a little overcooked , the mash was great and so were the vegetables. Desert however, aside being expensive was a disappointment. I would go back for the burger!",Artisan's Burgerbar
10,terrible food. Order burger with mashroom and mashroom sauce. no any sauce in the burger. the chips were terrible as well,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Very nice place, centrally located with excellent service and 100% beef burgers, the bigger and most delicious burger i tried in nicosia. A bit expensive and drinks also, with extra charge of potatoes or salad but you doesnt eat such burger everyday",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,If you need a good burger in Nicosia with a nice variety then you have to visit this Burger Bar. Nice atmosphere and very good service.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,i been to this burger bar after reading reviews on tripadvisor and this burgerbar offers so yummy delicious burgers. it is the best burgerbar in the nicosia.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I quite enjoy this burger bar and have dined various times when in Cyprus.The burgers are a little bit expensive but the food is good and well presented. I must admit that they make a very acceptable effort but I would like to see some more exquisite flavours after all they claim to be a 'gourmet' burger bar! why not try White truffle oil with truffles topped with a little foie grass for instance? or a surf and turf style burger with langoustine with pure Aberdeen Angus beef ...or with a whiskey pecorino infused cheese! or a shrimp wasabi burger! The ideas are endless..My favourite has to be the crispy pancetta and gruyere cheese with BBQ sauce with mash potato and creamed parmesan because most of the other burgers involve feta and halloumi. This is too Cypriot and needs a little more class in it's flavours NOT ENOUGH CREATIVITY OR INNOVATION! The other nicely balanced burger which is tasty I found must be with the caramelised goat cheese, roasted bell peppers, thyme and chill mayo.I did not like that every single burger is topped with tomatoes and after travelling to this country so many times found that Cypriots put tomato literally EVERYWHERE and are obsessed with this fruit. No doubt tomatoes are delicious but many dishes can do without! Why not decorate the plate with a few plum tomatoes instead, as topping them up this way constantly only ruins the presentation and can make a burger look soggy and unrefined.I did also not like the menu which uses only numbers, I would like to have seen beautifully descriptive ones instead! I believe this is due to the lack of waiters intelligence to remember which burger each customer is referring to....The biggest let down here are the deserts which are ALL accompanied with another Cypriot obsession; ice cream!The cocktails are terrible and even the apple martini is made with apple liqueur and non of them use any kind of fresh pulp!This is a place to go when one desperately misses a different kind of burger but not to be impressed.Overall it is better than most places in Nicosia and I would urge you to give it a try when in town...not much else to compare this category.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I'm just addicted to it , the best burgers by far in Nicosia. Top quality materials you can't compare it with anything else in here , and cause I read many complaints about the pricing well sorry to say it but ur paying 10 12 euros for frozen processed junk food burgers at pubs well if you pay 2 more you have a real burger , only the quality of the meat makes up for the price alone . Highly recommend it.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,nice place! delicious staff! very big portions! friendly! good price! by far the best restaurant in the city!!!!!!!!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,I guess the place is a little bit over-rated! I went there with my friends because everyone said it is a must try burger place! Frankly it wasn't what I expected! It is relatively expensive to any other burger place around the area. Quantity of food is not also that much. Food was really late! I didn't like their service! It is not my place to be! I will think twice if I have the option to choose.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,It is nice but it could be way better than what the have now. Burgers don't need sauce!! that is my opinion.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Well, honestly, it's like the best burger restaurant in town. And yes it's a restaurant. All in all, it has a satisfying variety of burgers and drinks. Also you can make your own. The prices are friendly and the quality amazing. Nice environment, quiet, especially the night hours. Overall, if you find yourself in Nicosia, Cyprus it's worth checking it out.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,They Use Angus meat and prepare the burgers very artistically. its a different experience. the restaurant has a great atmosphere. The only down side is the astronomical price. well if you compare it with TGİ the prices are a little higher but a good burger,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,if you are a burger person and willing to pay for it like eating a good fish or steak then this is your place. food is good but apart from burgers not much to say about it.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Went with family and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the meal. We were shown to our table by a pleasant waiter. We each chose our burgers and were happily surprised when each was served his/her burger. I had a cheese burger with blue cheese and caramilized figs... Was delicious:)Of course a delicious meal is followed by a bill. Was expensive but have to confess it was delicious...,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,One of the best burger's I've had in Cyprus! Try the pesto one and the one with mozzarella and cranberry! Amazing!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"We came in on a Friday night without a reservation, and have settled on the bar since the place was entirely booked. It was a joy watching the cocktails being carefully made. They use fresh ingredients and prepare their drinks very, very carefully. It is a joy to watch and a pleasure to imbibe. The burgers are beyond excellent and the staff (and the owner!) are unbelievably pleasant to interact with. This is one of the best places in Nicosia. If you have a chance to go, do not miss it!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"The angus burgers are excellent, but there is a wide selection of not only beef burgers, but also chicken, veggie and salmon burgers. The fries are also great. A bit pricey though.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Good quality good service pleasant environment and reasonable prices for quality offered burger is fine quality beef,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Amazingly nice burger experience. We visit the restaurant very often and have tried almost all different versions of burgers that are offered. All the burgers we had were great. They are very nicely cooked. My favorite is the burger with the mushroom sauce and mash potatoes!!! Trully recommended.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Nice place for burgers. Great onion rings but burgers where not what we expected and very expensive.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"It really has the best burger in Nicosia! A lot of choices of burgers, always fresh ingredients. Nice atmosphere.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Just the best burger I ever tried....very nice place to eat, good service good prices easy to find...it touch the perfection...worth it every penny!!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,The place for burgers.....minimal design and interior with a great variety of burger combinations and some interesting choices of local materials (e.g. sieftalia burger) family friendly and very good option for lunch,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,The good quality of meat and the interesting selection of side dishes are a good reason to visit again!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We visited the restaurant as a couple during the winter of January. The food was excellent very good value for money. Recommend to everyone A++++,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"The beef burger was delicious according to my meat eating boyfriend. The veggie burger arrived inside a delicious fresh brown bun, a bed of rocket, pomegranate and some sort of sweet sauce. All in all this was tasty but the burger on it's own needs improvement. I could taste the egg (not suitable for strict vegetarians) and flour which reminded me of pancake mix. Barely any vegetables within the burger. A little bit burnt and oily on the outside but overall one of the better efforts for a veggie burger in Nicosia. Taking everything into account - a pleasant experience, nice atmosphere, central location and good service.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Who would have thought a burger could be so up scale?? it has to be the best burger place i have ever visited!!! the menu is straight forward with so many choices of burgers even the most difficult customer will find a burger to satisfy their taste buds!! The staff and service is always impeccable. It has become our favourite place to go to on Nicosia. A true experience!! :),Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Tasteful burgers. This restaurant in mu opinion has the best variety of burgers. Family friendly. My kids enjoy every visit. Recommended!!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Went on a busy Friday evening and had the best burger I had so far in a Cypriot restaurant. Burger was prepared perfectly for my liking! The chef has also brought in a variety of new burgers that you cannot find in other places. Visiting is a must!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Went Sunday noon for a burger! Nice atmosphere with lounge music and helpful and attentive stuff.We tried the No3 (blue cheese burger) and No5 (caramelized goat cheese) burgers medium cooked! The burgers were perfectly cooked and tasty. One of the best burgers I've tried.The only downside is that they charge for the side dishes which I believe is too much for a burger that costs 13-16 euro. By the way mashed potatoes are perfect though!Highly recommended!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We were never disappointed. We are big fans of their good quality burgers and amazing mashed potato!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Been there quite a few times. Have tried several burgers and as I feel that the simpler the burger, the better the taste. Several places like this one have opened in Nicosia recently, but Artisan's has been doing this for quite some time, and has been doing it well. You can choose from a decent variety of burgers, including chicken fillet burgers, with a variety of breads, toppings, sources, and sides. You also have the option of choosing how well your patty will be cooked. Found that even if you ask for medium it can often be a bit on the overcooked side. It is also nice that you're able to further customize burgers based on your taste, regardless of how they are presented in the menu. Service has always been good but be prepared to wait about 15 to 20 minutes for a burger if the kitchen is busy.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I am visiting Artisan's 3-4 time's a year with my family. Never let us down! Excellent is the best way to describes this burger heaven ,in all the ways! A big bravo to all the people that are working at Artisan's burger bar!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"we where looking for something nice to eat mid day wednesday 15:30 everything was close,Only fast food was open.we pasted by and we stoped.Huge burgers excellent taste good service, a bit expensive.Nice decor.Try it",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"This is a place that honors its name! It has a variety of burgers and you can choose your own bun/bread, your own sauce, toppings and cooking, or just choose one of the options included in the menu. The burger was tasty and just as I like it, the meat was juicy with no additional and unnecessary ingredients. I rated it with 4stars because the staff was late and they were not very well organised. they asked us twice if we want to order since we have already ordered and when we requested the bill they forgot about it and we had to ask again, Nevertheless they were very kind!! All in all, these are not serious issues for me and I will definitely visit again!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"excellent service, fantastic food, elegant clean restaurant, friendly stuff, great variety to choose from to form your burger, vegetarian and kids friendly. Portions are adequate and great taste. Loved the Wholegrain pepper sauce and Wild mushroom sauce with portobello mushroom. Also try the halloumi bites with pomegranate sauce and the buttered fried zucchini sticks. Once you have tasted it you will definitely go back again!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Been there a couple of times lately. I can only say that it is constantly improving.Service is great and enjoying what they are doing. The burgers and fries are really special!We also ordered for take away and again everything was spot on. The only problem is that the Take Away prices are the same as the dine-in ones so it is a bit of expensive. Delivery using a local delivery company is even more expensive. Most of the similar places in Nicosia offer a 20% discount for take away.Overall the place is definitely recommended to everyone. The burgers are just great and it is by far the best burger place in Nicosia at the moment,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Excellent food and unique gourmet burgers, yet reasonable prices. Portions are huge as well. Love the sides as well! Try the marshed potatoe side and the appetizer with the halloumi cheeze and the pomegranate sause.",Artisan's Burgerbar

We got there early at 7 and we're the first there,but by 8.30 it was filling up.The food was amazing,we all had burgers and they were superb large and very very tasty, and very fillingService was great!.As a general pointer each burger is cooked medium this is cyprus means rare so go for well done.In short go to this place!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Cosy but modern restaurant, with very good food and service. Had the deep-fried halloumi with a salad as starter, followed by prawn burger (with avocado, yummy!) and sides of mash potato and chips (sweet potato, parsnips and potato). Friends had the meat burger options and they were just as satisfied with the dinner!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Delicious home made burgers, nice friendly people but a bit expensive for a burger. We went there with friends and we had a very tasty experience!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Good atmosphere, tasty burgers and very friendly service from the staff. The burger is cooked as you order it and not as the cook wishes. The burgers are made from 100% Angus beef, hence the cost may be a bit high for eating burgers. Nonetheless, if you wish to have a nice burger every now and then, Artisan's is the place to be.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"This place is simple, cheerful and makes great burgers at a reasonable-ish price.... Need to book on weekends which is a pain as usually i choose this place on the spur of the moment as it's a casual affair.",Artisan's Burgerbar

50,Huge variety of burgers. Really enjoyed the atmosphere... Burgers were exactly as I ordered them! Definitely going there again.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,I visited the place a lot of times and indeed it has the best burger plates in nicosia acompanied by fresh french fries or salads. I cannot say it is excellent becuse a couple of times the burger was a bit dry.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"i have been there 2 times. the variety of plates is huge!however, both times my burger was very ""dry"", with very poor sauce that would help me enjoy it!!! expensive plates....have in mind that its only a burger!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"It is a nice, cozy, modern style burger joint which serves quality beef burgers (but not only beef). I went there a number of times and I was always satisfied. Prices are reasonable. There is an outside available as well... Drinks and cocktails are a choice too... All and all, very good place for a casual lunch or dinner.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"If you are a Burger lover, this is the place to visit. Service is good, Draft Beer available, pricing reasonable.",Artisan's Burgerbar

50,"I have been going to this place for years and i absolutely love it. Best burgers in Cyprus, great staff and a nice atmosphere. Highly recommended.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,You will be surprised but one of the best burgers I enjoyed was in Nicosia and believe me I'am a meat lover and I know what I'am talking about. Big variety of sauces and combinations very good meat quality and precision cooked to your preference .I visited a lot of burger joints and this one is my favorite.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"A small restaurant rather than a bar. Caters for families with kid friendly menu, as well as a more sophisticated offering of traditional (home made) burgers with a twist.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Have eaten here a couple of times and always been impressed. Casual friendly service, great food and reasonable prices.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,The environment was very friendly with the staff very helpful and kind all the time!! The food was perfect maybe one of the best burgers ever ate!! I will highly recommend it for all occations.. Can't wait to go again :)),Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Visited the place 5-6 times so far. Quality is constant.The patties are consistently of higher quality and you do not find bone or scar tissue in the mix. There are several numbers to choose from and all the side dishes (mainy fried) that you would wish for are there. You also get to choose the bread although this is no main attraction unless you are super concious of your diet in which case just dont go there.I believe that the menu needs a stir though but overal is a great place for an expensive burger. Service is good and the place does have an open kitchen or bar or sort of which is good. Located centrally off Makariou Street with plenty of parking around the corners.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"really best burgers in town with a great variety of delicious choices. Good service, accessible parking spots.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Excellent quality burger juicy and cooked to perfection but for a Burger lover like myself i would prefer a larger portion of chips or veggies on the side to compliment the burger and match the price.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"If you have not been here already you are missing out, great burgers and sides and nice atmosphere..The location is also very nice, right off Makariou street, so take a stroll in the Christmas decor and then have dinner or lunch here. One of my favorite places in Nicosia.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"If you love burgers visit this place but only for the burgers. Everything else, side dishes, service, variety, are average. The only things well above average are the burgers (they are really good) and the prices (well above average).",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,Tasty burgers but too expensive! The prices for a burger is around 12 -14 euro. For two burgers and two beers our bill was 39.60 euro... it’s not worth it and certainly we are not gonna vitit again!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nice burger place. Probably for burger lovers (I am not one of them) this could probably be a paradise.The burger was juicy and you could taste the quality of the meat. The toppings had a good variety but they were kept subtle enough so that you could taste the burger. Shame about the sides, which were not up to par with the rest of the dish.Atmosphere was nice, but a bit of rock music could probably fit better the menu.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"This is definitely the place to go for a good quality burger. Sounds basic and simple, but it's not. Beautiful budgets, very good chips, divine onion rings, home made chutneys.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Artisan's has consistently pleased my appetite for a good burger all the times I have visted the place (more than 10). It offers variety of combinations for the burger as well as good starters and side dishes. I would recommend to anyone to try the halloumi starter.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,variety of choices and ideas for your burger combination! friendly staff tasty burgers choice of sides recommended!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Very good menu and variety of burgers. You can choose type of bread and meat. A very pleasant environment to visit with friends family or a casual date after shopping!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Tucked away in a not so busy street, Artisan's is a real gem and something that has been missing from Cyprus for many years. I cannot recall many burger bars in Cyprus so i was very pleased to come across this place.We tried the burger with guacamole, mozzarella and chimichurri sauce (no.13) and the burger with crispy pancetta and gruyere cheese (no.2). Both were excellent and very tasty. The meat was super succulent and the buns were freshly made that morning in the restaurant itself. Nothing more you could ask for in a burger.The menu is simply and to the point of offering a wide range of burgers to meet every taste.Quite simply, we loved Artisan's and cannot wait to go there again. No nonsense, just Great Burgers!!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Very big portions, and very tasty, with good and friendly service although it was busy, the place to go if you enjoy burgers",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,Its a good place for a nice burger. Burgers can't never be gourmet food but they serve them in many special different ways. Halloumi and mint was good taste.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"The best burger in town . No words , only burger and excellent service . The burger .............. The burger ..............The burger .............. The burger ..............",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,One of the best places for burger lovers in Nicosia. It has a variety of burger combinations all of them perfectly cooked. My favorite is the one with blue cheese and as for the site try the fry potatoes. Fresh fry potatoes!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
20,I was really excited to see a real burger place open in Nicosia but unfortunately it did not reach my expectations.Overpriced with burger quality average at the most. They have to improve on many things. As far as service be patient.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"very good overall, good food, atmosphere, clean and above all tasty burgers and chips, well done!!!,!,!,",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We had a blue cheese burger and the one with caramelised goats cheese. the quality of the meat was excellent !! the blue cheese was not as good as the other one but overall it was probably the best burger i had in Nicosia so far.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"No,I was not impressed at all. Nothing special about the food. Not that clean either. And overpriced for burgers especially of that quality. There much better places to visit for lunch and dinner.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Great place, heavenly burgers! Excellent meat! Great chips and dips! The owner is a perfectionist! Very friendly and professional staff.I have ordered a burger with mustard sauce assuming the sauce was dairy free. When the dish came, the waiter advised that it contained dairy, the owner/ manager came to our table, apologised and replaced the dish without any hesitation with no extra charge! The client feels at ease and appreciated in this place. The ambiance is just perfect, the place is neat and very easy on the eye with high attention to details. The Nespresso is very much appreciated! Background music is timid and enjoyable :-)",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"We have come for lunch and dinner, and were quite happy with the food and service. The burgers are great and there is quite a variety for different tastes. Prices are are a bit on the high side.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Artisan's Burgerbar is one of the rare examples of restaurants that not only they have maintained their food quality and high service levels over the few years since opening but have actually improved as well. I have visited Artisan's 4-5 times and it has never let me down. They have a wide range of burger combinations and all that I have tried are very very good. Even though I haven't tried their non-beef offerings my friends said that they were also very good. Service was always top notch even when the restaurant was packed.

40,"This restaurant is worth a try, excellent location, service, and atmosphere. The menu is not that long, which in my opinion is a good thing, the staff is more that happy to alter any burger to your satisfaction.I eat here 4-5 times a year and I'm extremely satisfied, possibly the best burger I had in Nicosia.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"The burgers were very nice and there was a lot to choose from. I found though, that the extra sauces were unnecessary and also I think, it's slightly overpriced for some burgers. I probably will be going back though.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Excellent food! Been there with my family and enjoyed a splendid lunch. The burgers are soooo nice and presented excellently! We shall visit again for sure.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I visited this place for a burger on a world cup game night. I was curious to try it as I've heard others speaking highly about it. Overall it was a good experience, with a good burger (even though it was not the best I had) and a rather friendly and quiet atmosphere. I believe it is more expensive than what it's worth, which is why I did not rate it as excellent. I will probably visit again, although not too soon.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I have ordered from this place, and been there once as well, there service is nice and fast, place looks nice.The food is nice they have created a nice menu with many option, the burgers are delicious and the place is recommended if you are seeking some alternative burgers.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,The place specializes in burgers and they make them really good. The menu offers a variety of burgers and side dishes that can satisfy different kind of tastes. The environment and the service are very good and makes artisan's a perfect place for dinner in Nicosia.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I'll start off by saying that every single burger in the Artisan's menu is exceptional in all respects; taste, suitability of ingredients matched, presentation etc. How can I be so sure? It's simple - because I've tried them all!But Artisan's does not excel only on the food front; the quality of service offered by its highly skilled staff is exceptional, to say the least. You are made to feel right at home from the outset, with such politeness that should become the standard for restaurants that respect themselves and, by extension, their customers.My review wouldn't be complete, nor fair, without mentioning the cozy ambience in which patrons get to enjoy their burgers - it truly has the feel of an American chophouse that could be found in Miami or New York but, instead, it is located in Downtown Nicosia. I guess if one is equipped with a fertile imagination and experienced taste buds could use this attribute of Artisan's to take a two-hour trip away from Cyprus and into the very center of a true American burger heaven!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Dont take me wrong, it doesnt say its something else, but the limited options and the relatively high prices will not make me a regular. I must commend though that the service was very good.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,They serve tasty burgers. Although i would prefer a bit lower prices and more options to choose from. Maybe some more spicy ones?,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,If you are looking for a variety of unique and very delicious flavoured burgers than Artisan's burgerbar is THE place to go! The service and the atmosphere is great as well. Well worth the visit!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Many restaurants include burgers in their menu. Why not to leave it to the expert. Here you have your burger expert, Enjoy the juice meat of the Artisan !!",Artisan's Burgerbar

50,Excellent burgers in a cozy atmosphere. Loved the burger selection. Very tasty food. Worth the visit if you are in Nicosia. Hopefully they will expand in other towns as well!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"If you are on a diet, FORGET IT! Its a fully loaded dream with whatever takes your fancy, best beef, best cheeses, best sauces. Just delicious. Price average is around 14euros for a burger but you have to try it for lunch or dinner. Excellent service, casual atmosphere great to go with family or friends. Give you taste buds a thrill and forget calorie counting this once.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Very Tasty, great service, value for money and good atmosphere. The four best ingredients for a good meal.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Very nice atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant. There are different kinds of bread to choose for your hamburger. There is variety of hamburgers to choose, classic or alternative. The burger was very tasty and juicy although well-done cooked as I ordered it. The salad was fresh with a delicious dressing. I chose fried potatoes as a side dish for my hamburger but they were not crispy enough. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I had a great dinner. I will visit it again.",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"I will be frank. I liked this place. But not really! This is because the persons that owe it (not the gkarsons) have never heard of the sentence 'consistent quality'. I will explain you why:When it first opened this place I was among the first ones to visit it and try what they offerred in hamburgers and other plates. I was amazed by the hamburgers but, most of all, it was the handfried french fries that did it for me! They were the best, most tasty frenchies I had tasted: and they shouted 'HOMEMADEEEEEEE'. My second visit was equally good with nicely selected burger and still the best fries on the country. Take note of my third visit though: I ordered Burger No. 5 (pesto/brasil I think) and I was very much looking forward to have my excellent fried - instead of getting what I used to what did I get? Pre-fried french fried!!! Like the kind you buy from the supermarket!! I didn't say anything, nor to the gkarsons, nor to my wife. I just finished my meal, paid (my god, the prices!!!) and left.I gave them one more chance: I went there 3 weeks after and ordered the burger no. 7 with fries. AGAIN PRE-FRIED!!!!!!!!! And the worst part? The couple next to me where having the HANDMADE type, the one I feel in love with!!!!!!!!!!!!! I asked them to try one of them and they allowed me: it was them!!!!!! I made a complaint but the lady gkarson couldn't help me as she said that that's how they came out of the kitchen!!!!!!! I can't understand why a simple matter as that of the quality of a side dish cannot be upheld!!! Why did you accept to compromise your standards when people from all over Cyprus where visiting you on occassion of your lovely fries? Well, I have news for you people: LITTLE DETAILS SYNTHESIZE THE BIG PICTURE!!I'm sorry to be so frank but I had to warn fellow eaters so that they know the 'before and after' situation of your fries. In such difficult times you either do your best or you dont have the right of asking the customers to be regulars. Forewarning: shape up and return to your roots. Only in this way you will find yourselfs back to the heartland of the USA...I will come in a year to check on the quality of the fries. Until then you have plenty of time to imrpove.Thank you,",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"They have a great selection of burgers and sides... I recommend the halloumi & pomegranate to any vegetarians, they do good salads too so you won't feel left out. The burgers are really filling, so for the not so hungry share one and order lots of sides and salads. Totally worth the price for me!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I have noticed someone complaining about the chicken burger. I have been to this restaurant many times and when i ferst ordered a chicken burger it did come back not well cooked, whereas the beef burger was fine, since my husband was asked and replied that he needed it to be well-cooked. The next time we went there we asked for the chicken burger to be well-cooked, to which the waiter replied 'but the chicken is always cooked the same way!'. So we made the waiter write down that we REALLY wanted the chicken burger to be well-cooked. And this time it came back OK and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I do this every time I visit and the burger is thoroughly cooked, Anyone visiting, try the halloumi and pomegranate sauce for a starter, it is perfect.Also choose the mash potato as a side dish, it is really tasty, anyone who's been there always comments on it !",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"I went with my husband and my son 3 weeks ago ( a lot of friends recommended it) and liked the simple contemporary deco and the service. However, since it's food we are rating here, my chicken burger (and my son's) was -sorry!!- disgusting! Even though the presentation was fantastic the look of the burger when I cut it was off putting! Raw, like the low quality ones we buy at the supermarkets, not even close to home made like they advertize! The taste, worse!Too bad! They make a big effort to satisfy customers but they should please all customers not only the beef eaters. The reason I rate it 2 instead of 1 is because I tasted my husband's beef burger and it was fantastic! And the presentation great like But that wasn't what I ordered unfortunately! What I ordered was awful!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Been going there once every month and the burgers are consistently tasty. There is a variety of burgers with different buns that will keep most happy i believe. The restaurant is nice and the staff is very professional. Overall recommended.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"The food is just amazing every time I ate there. The ingredients are fresh, and the menu is very imaginative. It's an artistic twist on the good old classic burger. They also have good vegetarian options - salads, portobello mushrooms, halloumi cheese,... delicious!",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"I have been there once a few years ago when it first opened and wanted to revisit since my boyfriend is a burger lover. After our recent visit last week I realised the reason why we hadn't visited all these years..We called them for a reservation since it was Saturday night and they told us that they only had tables outside, but we agreed since we were planning our visit long ago. Indeed, the place was full and we were offered a table in the corner of the outside seating area.We had to wait about twenty minutes to place our order, since we were waiting for them to come to our table and eventually we had to call them ourselves. The options in the menu are adequate even for those who don't like the classic beef burgers. The waitress was friendly and helpful and proposed to take a starter or replace our extra sauce with the onion rings which included the same sauce (the difference in price was only 70 cents) and take them as a starter, since they had a lot of orders and it would take a while for our mains to come. We agreed to the second option since we were very hungry.The onion rings were tasty, and not long after, our burgers arrived. Their impressive presentation whetted our appetite for them even more. However, once we had our first bite, we got a bit disappointed; the caramelised onions in mine were not that good and the cheddar cheese sauce spoiled the flavour of the whole dish. Also, my grilled vegetables (as a side included in the price) were a bit raw for my taste. My boyfriend was not that happy either with his burger; the crispy pancetta could be barely eaten.Overall, the burgers in this restaurant are not that special, so their excessive price cannot be justified.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Great burger, a little high prices, you have a lot of choices for burger, the service was good and fast. Maybe I will go again. I think that they have to reconsider the prices.",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,Once and only.Average food with high prices.We even found a hair on our food.Just disappointedNever again :),Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"We have been before in the Artisan's Burgerbar and we were really satisfied. However, this time was nearly a dissapointment. At first, there was an unnecessary delay serving the burgers, since the place was almost empty. In addition to the delay, the burgers seemed to me not to be somehow dry (we ordered medium to well) and for sure not the delicious burgers that we have tasted the previous time. We have ordered burgers #5 and #7 of the menu and a fig & goat cheese salad, which was rather a dissapointment. Overall, I couldn't say that this was the last time, but it is almost sure that the next time will be after long time.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"Maybe we were unlucky - twice.Make no mistake the burgers, when hot and properly cooked are good, however the first time we went as a family 2 of the 3 burgers were cold- they were re-heated eventually with a minimum of fuss.. Only 10 people in the restaurant at the time. All 3, onceWe decided to return for lunch a couple of days later . Unfortunately one of the burgers was not cooked properly ie not to order. The plates were taken away twice to get re-cooked and the restaurant failed on both occasions to manage to cook a well done burger. Hey ho!If you are going to charge a slight premium for your burgers then the quality of food and service should be up to scratch. It wasn't.Maybe we were unlucky.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,The nice thing about this place is that there is a wide selcetion of burgers and you can choose what type of bun you like and what side orders you want.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Definitely the best burgers in town. Many choices for every taste, even for vegetarians in a nice place. The stuff is very helpful and the service is very good.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"One of the best burgers in town, great staff friendly and the food is great. Must eat burger in town. Though not located right in the heart of the city its just 10 minutes walk from Makariou avenue and 20 minutes from Ledra street.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"This is not a fast food burger.This is a prime beef, gourmet beef burger and you will not be disappointed.Add to that the great variety of side dishes and you have a place that's worth going to over and over again.I will try something else apart from the blue cheese and fig burger next time - I promise ;)",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Lovely sleek venue with attentive friendly staff. Hubby ordered burger No.2 and I had the veggie burger. In the price is a side dish of your choice: the fries were yum and slightly spicy and the grilled veggies of the day were perfect for me. So, plentiful tasty food and a nice local wine for €34. The beans!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Both tasty and juicy, unlike traditional mass production burgers. The best burger bar on the island by far. Highly recommended!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,we visited artisans last week with some friends and had a great night. the decoration was very relaxing and the restaurant was very warm. the service was very good and waiters were always ready to help. we ordered the burger with cheddar sauce which was very tasty and the beef burger was homemade and fresh. also side dishes such as smashed potato were tasteful. definately would visit the burgerbar again but i would choose another burger from the menu because i want to taste all different creations.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"My wife and I visited in January 2014 and sat outside in the road-side glass screened and heated area. We loved the decor and ambience of the restaurant inside and out. Very clean, stylish and modern. We were cheerfully greeted and looked after by equally friendly and attentive staff. The restaurant quickly became full after our arrival and the buzz was great. Mainly young-ish Cypriots relaxing and enjoying their evening. The waiter guided us through our options. Cocktails were excellent and the food was too. Better than many burgers we have eaten in the USA. Fresh, quality ingredients and the sauces were perfect. The friendly owner came to speak to us too and he made us feel even more welcome. Highly recommended and we considered this to be well priced for a city centre quality restaurant.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"It may not be your average burger joint, but that doesn't mean you can't treat it as one. Order the No2 and you'll get more texture with your burger. Probably not the best burger ever, but pretty good by the city's standards. Their cocktails are pretty good too. I would recommend this place for a nice casual dinner or lunch.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"By far the best burger we had in Nicosia in years. Prices are ok for the quality of food you get, and the staff is very helpful! Definitely what nicosia needed. Their meat is cooked perfectly, toppings are very creative, perfect brioche bread, and amazing fries - handcut and local.Definitely worth a visit if you're in town",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"This place has really good and unique burgers. The meat is excellent and the combination of ingredients is quite special - unlike any burgers I've tried before. The best thing about the place though is the staff. They are all welcoming, helpful and super friendly. You should definitely try this place out!",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"Being an American living in Cyprus my standard for a good burger are high. Artisan makes the effort but the texture of the burger was just mush, not what I'm looking for in a great burger. The toppings are imaginative but overall burger is not worth the gourmet price. Barbecue sauce on chicken wings was good but the wings were way overdone and tough. The order wasn't large so my husband finished them off anyway, with the help of a pint of beer. Told waiter they were tough and didn't really receive a response.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Located in the heart of Nicosia, perfect for both lunch and dinner. You should definetely try their cheddar cheese burger and mashed potatoes. Their tasty food along with the reasonable prices and friendly staff makes it the best burgerbar in town!!! It is strongly reccomended for burger lovers!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Artisan's definitely serves the best burgers in town (and probably in Cyprus!). The burgers are huge, perfectly cooked and delicious, and they are served with a side dish of your choice. There is a big list to choose from with very interesting combinations. I went for the mushroom burger and mash potatoes as a side and I was very happy with my choice. We also tried as a starter the fried halloumi with pomegranade sauce and we found it a very interesting combination (although the halloumi did not feel very tasty, but probably because it is not from pure goat milk as in many restaurants in Cyprus). Also the dessert was good and in a big portion, we had a cheese cake that was served with ice cream on the side. The service was excellent, the waiter took time to give us details about the food we want to order and afterwards he made sure everything was up to our taste. The menu may look a big pricey at a first glance, but after the dinner we thought it was good value for money because of the big portions and the high quality of the food! We will definitely go back!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"The beef burger was delicius on its own, but the dish as a whole i was expecting it to be something more. Nevertheless worths a visit. In my opinion they need to enrich their beer menu.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"If you are thinking of a burger and are in Nicosia or nearby, then the only place is Artisan's. Forget about what you knew so far about burgers and set a new burger standard. It is simply divine. If you really what to become addicted, try the mouthwatering chicken burger with pepper corn sauce. It's to die for. Just add a glass of Sauvignon blanc, and let your taste buds do the work.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,When I think of burgers the only good value for money place in town is artisans ! The service and food are excellent ... A great place to eat with friends !!!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Whilst the aspect of value for money is always a deciding factor when choosing a restaurant, I will say that the burgers at Artisans are worth their money!The place is modern, with clean lines, use of wooden elements and black board feature walls. Simple but well crafted. In the center, there is a bar and there is also an extensive outdoor seating area.I have been at Artisans about 5 times and suprisingly the quality and the flavours are better every time. At the beginning the burger toppings were modest and the fries were soggy. In my last visit, the burgers were perfectly cooked, the toppings were abudant, the fries were crisp and the salads were fresh and flavoursome. Were a group of 6 and we chose burgers number 1, 2 and 9. Burgers range with unusual toppings such as pancetta, caramelized onions, gruyer cheese, spicy mayo, blue cheese, figs, goat cheese, roasted peppers, rucola, wild mushrooms and more. The result are about 10 signature burger proposals with a fresh take on burgers. The meat used is of the highest quality. Simply delicious.Not of the same quality, the fries are average. Sometimes the ratio of crisp to soggy ranges. When the place is packed, it so happened the fries were soggy. Last night, they were ok. Besides burgers there are side dishes, salads and some other alternatives (chicken, fish etc) for the non burger fans.Each burger inclusive of a side does not come cheap: €11-15. Inclusive of drinks and maby a shared starter expect to pay €20-25pp. Overall this humble staple deserves its price. I would definitely go back.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I visited it today with friends to check if the Artisan's Burgerbar deserves its current position in the rank of the restaurants of Nicosia district in TripAdvisor (#8). At first the environment was very nicely decorated and the staff war really kind and friendly. We sat inside but you can sit also outdoors and the atmosphere seems really pleasant since there is not that much traffic and the neighborhood is really tranquil. We went for the signatures burgers #4, #5, #7 from the menu. I think that the time passed until we were served was about 20-30 minutes, but the result really satisfied us. The aesthetics of the burgers was amazing and they were delicious. We wnjoyed our meal very much and we also went for the strawberry cheesecake, which was also impressively served but it was not the same tasteful in comparison with the burgers. We payed almost 20euros/per person, but you can find the menu in the respective website. Overall, we enjoyed it very much. I absolutely recommend the place and I would certainly like to revisit it. Enjoy!",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"We visited this restaurant for a Sunday lunch and predictably it was full of families. The décor is very indifferent with subdued colours and light wood that would be more suitable at an office than a restaurant. The menu as others have said is made up of burgers, salads, a few starters of the kind of chicken wings and stuffed mushrooms and what is described as alternative burgers which includes vegetarian, chicken and seafood burgers. We skipped starters as we saw how huge the burgers going to the other tables were and ordered burgers and sides of potato chips and onion rings. The burgers were delicious and cooked medium as ordered. The sauces were nice and the vegetables fresh.They were in a brioche type bun that was not fluffy enough. Brioche buns go stale really quickly and should be baked several times in a day.The onion rings were very thickly cut and came under cooked, the onion was practically raw. The potato chips were fresh but average as they were not really crispy. A side sweetish sauce that was offered was indifferent and I am not sure what it was meant for, as it was not suitable either for dipping the fries or the onion rings. My main criticism was the price of the drinks. It was sky high and much higher than in any bar, never mind restaurant. Euro 5. 80 for half a litre of Stella is ridiculous (incidentally the menu refers to pint but in reality is a half litre which is about 15% less than a pint) and it is irrelevant if holders of certain bank cards get a discount. That discount should not be subsidized by other paying patrons. I had a look around and most people had one drink each and nobody lingered after finishing the meal as obviously ordering second drinks would break the bank but also maybe in part due to the place not being very cosy. The service was good and attentive and they kindly offered coffee on the house. I did not see any desserts on the menu not anybody eating dessert. Are there not any? I would go back as the burgers were the best I have had in Cyprus.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Great variety of burgers. Good prices and good quality. Weekends its better to make a reservation. Parking is available down the street,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Really unusual to find such attentive and helpful staff. Great menu with wide choice. Excellent burgers, delicious salads. Hope it stays open!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Probably one of the best, if not the best burger i ever had in Cyprus. Great atmosphere and in a nice and easily accessible location in the capital . Waitresses were very friendly and available at all times to serve you. The menu also includes a variety of 'unusual' burgers that i have never tried anywhere else in Cyprus.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"One of the best burgers I ever had for a long time! Fresh,juicy, perfectly cooked and a healthy option as well !! Great atmosphere and very welcoming personnel. The menu is super , offering many options to satisfy every single one. It's officially my personal best burger house :)",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Unusual but excellent burgers. A little bit expensive but it surely worth a visit every couple of months, discovering a different taste every time. Very helpful and polite staff.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I had been looking for a real burger in Cyprus for years without much luck. Until Artisan's opened. I can 101% claim it is the only real burger served in Cyprus. Juicy, fat, beef burgers put inside an amazing bun (which looks homemade) and served with very good homemade french fries.I hate places where waiters don't even ask you how you'd like your burger. Not this place. The waiters are actually (unlike so many places in Cyprus) informed about the food they serve and take you through the entire ordering process patiently and helpfully, never forgetting to ask the one most important question of a burger joint: HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR BURGER COOKED?That being said, a couple of times the kitchen has been inconsistent with delivering the correct order. I always order my burger medium rare, so once it came medium to well done and another time half of it was medium rare and half of it was literally rare.The decoration is simple but modern, a clean environment which lets you enjoy your burger. Even the toilets were literally spotless.I would easily rate 5 stars if not for the price. It doesn't come cheap. The price range of $11-16 in the TripAdvisor description is very optimistic. If one wants to order the cheapest burger, fries and a coke it will cost $22.5Of course it's understandable that good ingredients and rent cost, but a coke at 2.9 euro, 6 times more expensive than on a supermarket shelf is ridiculous. Not even wine allows for such profit margins.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Been there quite a few times and i was never disappointed! I always have one of the burgers, my favourite is the one with goat cheese on top! A great surprise was the chicken fillets i ordered for my children, i had no expectations, i expected something like nuggets but the fillets were hand-made, very fresh and yummy, they usually split a portion, this time we ordered one for each kid! Defenately recommended!",Artisan's Burgerbar

50,"We live in Limassol and have been wanting to try an Artisan burger for a while. When we did finally managed to it was well worth the drive!The burger was delicious,we both agreed one of the best we had ever had, and the man who served us was lovely. We are already talking about when we will come next and what will be our next burger choice :-) Thankyou",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nice new place, very good food! located at the centre of nicosia, the place is quite new, however the quality of the food was very good from day 1 until now!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,This is the best burger I've tried in Cyprus thus far. I have been there several times and the food as well as the service are consistently of a very high quality. If you like American-style burgers this is an absolute must!,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"In my experience, this is the best burger bar in Cyprus. The food is excellent and the selections you can make to create your burger are fantastic.The deserts let this restaurant down and they are not up to the same high standard as the burgers! When I go again, we will look somewhere else for desert!Service and main courses are excellent though!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Went there twice for lunch. First I tried the regular burger and second time the blue cheese & figs.Both were amazing! Cooked just right, exceptional buns, tasty cheese and everything else...The environment is clean and modern. Trendy. Service is very good & attentive.The only negative is that the fries are not amazing. They are ok but could be much better. They came coated in a salt&spice flavouring that is too salty for me. Second time I ordered them plain but they were too, how to put it... Ordinary.If they had hot&crispy fries, I would've given 5 stars. Because fries are an integral part of the burger experience, I will (sadly) substract one point! Sorry guys!My mouth waters just writing the review! Definitely a favorite!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Visited this restaurant on a Saturday late afternoon. As expected there were only 2 tables and we were the 3rd one at the time. This made service really quick. But in addition the 2 waiters working at the time were really helpful and offered to help us with the menu and they were really friendly.i am only noting the above to make it clear that my review on the service is clearly related to the time we visited.The food was quite good. The burgers and the salad we tried were really really good. it's been a long time since we have tried such a tasteful burger.Three issues that i would like to point out, hoping that they will be adressed by the management are the following:1. the side dish(french fries) were of really low quality. Over cooked and really oily. This messed up the whole burger flavor. Simple detail to take care of, but essential to the whole dining experience.2. the outside table that we were seated was covered with dust. I understand the whole concept of outside seating in a hot city like Nicosia, but there should be some extra attention in keeping the tables clean for the customers.3. We ordered a grilled chicken salad dish. Unfortunately the chicken was boiled and then grilled so it had that taste of chicken soup in it. I have seen that happening in many places in Cyprus. I guess that's a way to save time and keep chicken tender, but this has to be mentioned on the menu. When a customer orders grilled chicken this is what he must get. Not pre-boiled short-grilled chicken.Anyway, the overall experience was good. The prices are really reasonable and one could even say they are cheaper than expected.I would definately go back and highly recommend it to anyone. I expect that the minor issues above will be adressed. I did not have the chance to point them out during our late lunch but i will surely do that on my next visit.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Thoroughly enjoyed my eating experiences (visited the restaurant a couple of times) at Artisan's. The burger was cooked as ordered, service was excellent and outside seating offered a beautiful environment. Strongly recommended.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,This restaurant is a gem in Nicosia for the traditional burger lovers! We visit often and apart from the traditional 100% authentic beef burgers we also enjoy the alternative selections. I recently tried the vegie burger and my wife the shrimp burger. Both delicious and cooked to perfection. We also love the informal and friendly atmopshere.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Having recently moved to Nicosia from many years living between London and New York I had been tremendously disappointed by the quality of food served in the majority of the capital's most popular restaurants. That was until I stumbled upon Artisan Burger which offers the yummiest burgers (and beleive me I have tasted good burgers) as well as a large variety of yummy starters and side dishes!! The quality of the food is fantastic and the service is always wonderful (and local which is very important in my eyes). I am shocked that some people beleive it is unreasonable to require a reservation. I have found that in Cyprus you need a reservation for the most basic taverna let alone a trendy burger bar in the centre of town which offers food that actually tastes good!! Maybe they should try McDonald's next time: no reservation required although the prices may be similar! My personal opinion is that 12 euros for a burger and side dish is definitely a bargain! As a mother of a 10 month old I would also like to add that it is a very child friendly restaurant and this combined with the quality of the food has made it a favourite within our little family (we visit at least once every two weeks and sometimes even order take out!). If you chose to take your little one along you will be provided with a lovely comfortable wooden highchair and will have access to a clean modern baby changing facility which I am sure will make any mummy very happy : )Overall it is a top burger bar definitely worth visiting!,Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"Seriously you have to be kidding me! Do I need a reservation for eating a burger? The place was too formal and the prices were too much. We were very disappointed. It was the first and the last time there. The burger wasn't cooked enough, it was a reddish disgusting overpriced meat.For gods sake we weren't there for paying a burger at the price of sushi!!P.S we didn't like the taste at all.",Artisan's Burgerbar
20,I visit often cyprus and like to visit new placesvisited the artisan for lunchi have ordered my burger medium but actuall it was like suvlaki-well well donealso the 15 euro for one burger + the side dishes + drinks seems very expensive,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,The place is simple and cosy. It is open all day long. You can visit it whether you are a vegetarian or even if you prefer a healthier approach of a burger. Choose from a variety of meat or fish and even select the type of your bun if you want one. In the price you have a side dish to choose from a list of different type of potatoes or vegetables.,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I'm always apprehensive about reviewing new places after only one visit. After a 2nd visit my wife and I agree AB's food and service is outstanding. The burgers are creative, food is fresh and staff are very helpful. Inside decor is original making the atmosphere exceptional for a casual mea.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Very simple, clean and cozy place to enjoy a great meal; the salads are very generous and delicious; the burgers are huge and extremely tasty, with a selection of freshly baked bread and a variety of sides and sauces. Unfortunately, we were not able to try the appealing desserts, as we were full after the main course and we did not want to miss the taste of the delicious real burgers (they are not just a burger) we just had.Just 3 minor comments that did not affect at all our fantastic experience; the outdoor space need curtains to control the wind, 2 burgers ordered as well done were delivered as medium; still enjoyed it, and the menu should not be that simple; it would be great to see the photos in the web site for first time visitors.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Brilliant burger bar in Nicosia!! it has all kinds of burgers for those who love this kind of food. Even for those who dont there are salads available!! Desserts are amazing especially the ice-cream burger!,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,Having recently moved to Cyprus I have been trying to find a good burger joint that serves Angus beef. It is nearly impossible to find a good burger in Cyprus that isn't made worth the horrible mash that is known as Cyprus beef. I decided to give this place a chance. It is the only place so far that has a real burger made from real Angus beef. That being said I have lived my whole life in north America and have literally had hundreds of better burgers than this restaurant. They are the best by far in Cyprus but remotely far from great burgers I have had in north America.,Artisan's Burgerbar
30,i vistiteding this partucular plece over a sundya or saterdey i dont remember but it was good and the people in it were good. come to think it about it they offered me some good wine and enabled my tasting to be memoryble so i thank you very much people of artesens and i was am looking forwrad to join hambruger with u in the distant future. one note fore referencing: you can make introduction of the experience of eating with bare minimum hands like we do in iran because the really good pleasure that comes from this kind of eating like we do in iran and we like it - it is simple it is pleasureful and it gives euphoria - i wait to see this happen in my next two couple of visits. THANK U TEAM ERTISENS FOR THIS GREATFUL EXPERIENCING! C YA SOION!!!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"So- as a fan of Red Meat, burgers in particular- this is probably the best place you will find anything even remotely close to excellent Meat in Cyprus. I was extremely happy to find that the meat was indeed Angus Beef- and all ingredients and flavors are exquisetly fresh and flavorful!The FRIES!! (Chips) WOW! For anyone who knows what Five Gyus fries are like- the Artisan BurgerBar's fries are like that- but better!!There is quite a bit of variety here- not only do they have 12 signature burgers that you can choose from on the menu, but you have the option to ""create your own"" by choosing your own toppings and kind of bread your burger comes on. Additionally they have OUTSTANDING starters- although you may want to share so you don't fill yourself up - as the burgers are not small.The only down side we experienced is that we arrived at a slow time of the night I suppose- literally only 4 people in the whole place and I walked in with a party of 4 with one child myself. I believe only 3 people were working at the time- but it took 15-20 minutes for someone to come ask us if we wanted drinks- and another 10-15 minutes to get them...I don't know why. Service for our visit was a bit lacking- but once our orders were in- everything was excellent! The food came out fairly quick and it was delicious!I highly recommed this establishment- especially if you love burgers!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I was looking for a long time now for the best burger in town. And believe it, it couldn't been done better...I visited Artisan's a couple of times now and it was always a unique experience. For those who love burgers and especially alternative and unique choices and flavors this is the place to be... The food is great, service is excellent, staff is friendly. Nothing else to ask for. Fried halloumi with pomegranate sause is highly recomended. Can't wait to visit them again and try there desserts",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Visited couple of times.. First time Ive tried beef burger with cheddar cheese sauce, the second time chicken burger with creamy pepper sause with crispy onion rings on top. Both fresh, very tasty and very well cooked. Nice prices, friendly service and cozy environment. A true burger bar!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Great place, well decorated, really nice atmosphere, friendly staff. I have been there several times. Also they have a well organised take away service. I highly recomend fried halloumi cheese as starter. its delicous. As main dish try the one with the smoked cheese. Also there is a variety of beers and wines.Can't wait visiting you again. Well done. All the best in the future. See you soon!!!!!!!!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"The Artisan's Burger bar was good at first but it is improving every time i eat there. The beef is great, the sides are great and the salads are huge (seriously they are too filling for a starter). The food here is worth paying a small premium for. Strongly recommended.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"Let me be honest. Food was not bad. Actually it was better than average. I didnt get crazy about it. Flavor didnt explode in my mouth. No fireworks, no special excitements. Just pleased to have a very decent burger. But please guys, no offense really... its a burger for god's sake!!As far as I am concerned - personal taste not argued - I value burgers for what they are... a fast food invention that can be amazing only if the quality of the meat is EXQUISITE and if sometimes is accompanied by other excellent quality ingredients that add tot he overall flavor.Pricing policy. Inexcusable. I saw some comments by another reviewer about the price and how the manager dealt with it...the answer was that ""Unfortunately, or not, different things come at a different price and not all things are the same. We are not just another burger place, we do top quality food and top quality service."".Well, I have a word for you dear Manager. You are ABSOLUTELY right. Unfortunately! But not for the customers, but for you guys. Your place will not be long lived no matter how good you make your burgers. People are not willing to pay the same money they would pay for a meze at a local taverna or even a decent meal at an average+ restaurant, to get a burger instead.Good luck guys and no hard feelings with me :)",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"Entrees: 4/5 - these were done well. I had the turkey-brie entree salad which was large and delicious. The only negatives were it had almost no brie (why not just say it includes brie along with the other of many ingredients rather than call it a turkey-brie salad?) and that there was a small turkey bone present. My fiancée had an artisan hamburger and called it one of the best they have had. The side of fried vegetable chips was also nicely done.Dessert: 2/5 - we were both excited to order the 'brownie hamburger' which was supposed to be brownie with vanilla ice cream. Most places do this combination very well, but it was an utter letdown here and more of a basic ice cream sandwich. The brownie was a frozen cookie and both parts were far from fresh. Aside from the fact it wasn't what we expected, we have honestly had much better frozen supermarket desserts.Service: 2/5 - not really sure what went wrong here. Very slow service who would not check on us for absurdly long periods of time despite it being fairly empty. Language may have been an issue, but it did seem like a fairly English-speaking location. In any case, after taking and providing our initial drink orders in a friendly manner, it was a long wait for meal orders, and after that we were never asked how the food was or if we wanted more drinks (we did). After a very long delay we had to wave them down for dessert (which seemed to be a surprise) and we decided to skip the bottle of wine. When dessert ended up being a letdown, we told them the entrees were lovely but dessert was not. The response was a bit chilly and indifferent, so we decided it was time to ask for our bill (which again took forever to get). My fiancée and I are quite wealthy, but being young and after doing several exotic countries on this trip dressed more like students (we dress up for fine restaurants, but this is a bistro pub), so this may have been what discouraged much attention.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,Very good place to eat a gourmet burger. A lot of nice choices. Very good service. Also good prices.,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"The burgers at this place are great, and with a very large variety to choose from. Personally I've had a burger cooked to perfection here than I have had steak cooked elsewhere. The prices are ok and also the service was very good.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Personally, my friends and I have eaten the best burgers at this place. They are cooked as meant to be, the price is very logical and the atmosphere is great whether you choose to sit inside or outside. There is a wide variety of beer as well so if you are a beer and burger lover this must be your next choise!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I always appreciate a good burger cooked to taste (medium is the default here), with classic and modern combinations. I got the caramelized goat cheese burger (#5 on the menu) with mashed potatoes, and I was impressed by the flavor and cooking style of the burger, and the consistency of the mashed potatoes. Will visit again. Good service, and we got a 20% discount too (not sure why).",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,From the first time we visited this restaurant we were thrilled not only by the excellent quality of the food but also by the very good service and its pleasant atmosphere. Since then we became regular customers and enjoy our meal every single time. One of the few best restaurants in Nicosia with reasonable prices. Strongly recommended and will never disappoint.The ideal place for those who value QUALITY in their food and of course burger lovers!!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Taking burgers to a different level. Visit hungry, inspired and decisive. The drool-inducing options will make you coming back for more. I've heard people complain about the prices. The prices are right - this food is prepared with care & creativity, the meat and other ingredients are top notch - despite having the name 'burger' after it!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"Nice food, good variety of burgers (you can even customize a burger to your preference), excellent service and in general a nice casual place to enjoy a good burger!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"We visited Artisan's burger bar two times since it opened and we will definitely coming back for more!The service is friendly, the food is great and the prices are cheap. There are about 10 different kind of burgers (toppings) and if you visit their website, the food looks exactly as shown in the pictures. The burgers are thick and juicy and the buns are fresh and soft.There are chicken burgers as well for those who don't like beef.However, I must say the fried potatoes I ordered as a side were not so nice as they had lots of oil and the deserts are a little pricey.A nice add on (don't know if is available) would be to get to make your own burger (DIY burger :) ) and the price could change accordingly.I hope they don't strive away from burgers (as this is a burger bar) and keep up the good work!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"Easily the best burgers in Nicosia. The meat is top quality, expertly cooked (it's difficult to get burgers in Cyprus which are not overcooked), and I loved the ideas behind the burgers. Don't miss the one with the feta and tzatziki. Although I read some of the reviews saying it's overpriced.I don't think it is. It's a sit-down restaurant with a great atmosphere, super-friendly service and quality burgers, so you pretty much get what you pay for. Restaurants like these abroad (especially in the UK), charge approximately the same if not more. Anyway, I think it has plenty of potential and I will certainly be going back for more.",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"We came once for lunch on a Saturday after a friend had mentioned the place. We were pleasantly surprised to find a good selection of burgers, and both the ones we tried were very nice. We will be back for sure.",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,"Overall it's a promising place with potentials however, it's definately overpriced.Warm, nice atmosphere, good service, quality (medium-size) burgers (althought, different burgers style tasted almost same).But... it's not as if you go for gold, it's just a burger bar.In times like these when people feel the crisis symptoms, there are no great possibilities of surviving when overcharging. We were two couples and we pay 86 euros. Consider a family with 4 members to pay such an amount just for a burger meal. OMG!!!In general, we had a good time but the bill was not so nice. With all due respect, I suggest a price adjustement ASAP for your long-run pass...",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"The best burger in town. Juicy and tasteful with an outstanding quality of meet. The atmosphere is warm and the staff welcoming and friendly. In general, if not the best definetely one of the best spots in town for lunch or dinner.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,Probably the widest variety of burgers dishes. Very good food quality and service. Decor is minimal and very modern. A good addition to our market,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"The burgers where delicious and tasted excellent. This is a very good place to eat if you like Angus beef, service is great and nothing comes close in Nicosia for burgers. Great job!!!",Artisan's Burgerbar
40,The food was really good however the second time we went i found it hard to pick something. I think they could do with more choice,Artisan's Burgerbar
40,"I was there today with friends for Lunch. It was a good lunch, burger was juicy and delicious with a good quality of meat.Staff was welcoming, and explaining the menu very well.Service need to improve into some issues i.e add water to the empty glass ask for a second drink, collect the empty plates before to bring the bill and ask for desserts.I will go there again and i will recomend it to my friends as well.My rate is 4.5 out of 5 but once on trip advisor are only 4 or 5 stars thats why i rate it for 4.Prices for the Quality of food was Super!",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,The most delicious burgers ever! Excellent atmosphere and service! Definitely a place that you could visit as often as possible.,Artisan's Burgerbar
20,"Good concept, but adjusted (as everything else) to the pretentious Cypriot reality. Started well, but then it all went downhill, due to I’m guessing inexperienced management. Food not that great, and overall not the best choice for a nice dinner down town Nicosia.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"I was in Nicosia for just a few hours on business. I was planning on leaving when some of my colleagues insisted on going to Artisans burgerbar for a quick bite. Said the burgers were ""really nice"". People there were friendly, atmosphere was cool. But what really excited me was the rich taste of everything there. I had the three mini burgers for starters, which were awesome and a burger with smoked cheese sauce for main that blew my mind away. The dessert was even better. I just love a good burger. Next time im in town ill be there no question.",Artisan's Burgerbar
50,We visited Artisans for the first time last month and have been regulars even since. As restaurant enthusiasts we have a good eye for quality and detail and know the difference between a regular burger and an Angus Beef burger. Artisans did not fail to deliver what is expected and it is great to see that quality is not comprimised! The service and ambiance make a wonderful evening. Prices are reasonable and not more expensive than other places in town. Favourite burger which i highly recommend is the portobello mushroom burger!,Artisan's Burgerbar
50,"The food is amazing , best burgers I have tried in a long time! everything is fresh and the staff is very friendly and helpfully! Will be back many times!",Artisan's Burgerbar
30,We went there twice to try it out as we love our burgers.unfortunately both times we were dissappointed.as a burger place we thought the meat would Aplus quality and well spiced.they failed all different burger styles tasted the same.they also dont offer a veggie burger..all side dishes and sauces are extra so u end up with a nice bill.deserts the first time were great yet on our second visit the standard went down!,Artisan's Burgerbar
