20,The food is very good and serve fast but last time we had an argument with the owner. There were kids and infants and the allow smoking with the excuse that is an open space.. We complained but the owner prefer to let down children infants and mothers that customers who smoke.. Ok its General in Cyprus not to follow rules and regulations but this is cruel.,Estiatorio Euroullas

50,"Eurollas was packed with locals enjoying souvlaki and grilled meats. We were stuffed from a large lunch and just had a Cretan salad and a Chicken Caesar salad, but these were delicious. The place is almost impossible to find, but the easiest way is probably to find Pieto cafe on Ledras Street and just walk through. Find the place and go!",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,The best place to visit for lunch with friends or alone! Whenever you visit it’s always high quality standards food for eating! See you soon!,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,OMG a must visit to this tiny place in downtown Nicosia do not leave without visiting for home cooked meals,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Even though Nicosia is not a touristy place, the cluster of restaurants in Lidras street and its immediate vicinity comes closest to a tourist hub and seems to have variable quality and authenticity. I visited this one on a late summer evening and it was only filled with local guests, which to me is a very good sign. The food itself was great, tasty, tender, juicy, simple but of really good quality. Do not expert talkative waiters or fancy desserts, this is a place to enjoy souvlaki and other traditional fare with no fuss, no rush, in the light breeze coming from the lively pedestrian street (as pointed out by other contributors, the entrance is on Onasagorou, a few paces south of the Avo restaurant). Count about 10 euros for a copious dish and a drink.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,Great food and very friendly service. Hidden away in an alley an adventure all by itself. A very nice secluded location.,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Excellent food, very nice people, good atmosphere in a nice passage, highly recommended to all visitors",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"This little downtown restaurant, set up in a relaxed and quiet atmosphere in the centre of Nicosia, offers a good variety of high quality traditional food at very low cost.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,One of the best place to visit and enjoy lunch! Don’t forget to salute the boss and choose from a big variety of Cy plates!,Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"Visited the place during a day out in the old part of Nicosia. We were looking for a place to have lunch with a flare of the local cuisine at reasonable prices and I must say that this place ticked all of the boxes. Well, almost all of them.To start with, each day they serve different types of local dishes so what you can have and what not will really depend on the day of your visit. Apart from grillled dishes which are everyday available.During ourvisit we ordered 'afelia' (Cypriot dish made of pork cooked in a red wine based sauce served with rice cooked to local recipes) and grilled chicken skewers (served with some side salad, pitta bread and a dish of Cypriot Green olives and green peppers). Price was quite good as well. 15 EUR for two people is pretty good.Service could have been better though. The girl there showed us a list of five dishes that supposedly were served on Mondays but when we were ready to order she took us for a trip down the 'I-messed-up' boulevard when she said that actually three of those five dishes (our dishes of choice basically) weren't feasible due to a basic ingredient not being in stock.Anyhow, she seemed to be the only person serving cusomers on the day so understandably so she missed that bit but hospitality, the main ingredient for restaurants that want to stay in business was not there during our visit. Just like the basic ingredient of the days dishes they did not stock up much of it.",Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"The restaurant of Euroulla (Estiatorio Euroullas) is found in a small 'passage' joining the two main pedestrian streets in the heard of the old town of Nicosia, Cyprus. It is a place where you can enjoy the authentic cuisine of Cyprus with the traditional food, cooked in the best way the Cypriot women know. The prices are very cheap and the service quick and friendly. Don't miss it.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,Highly recommend. Best food we had in Cyprus this month. My partner who is Cypriot is still singing this places praises for great charcoal meat. We got the Meze for 2 at €22. Shared between two meat eaters and one vegetarian. Great amount of food and great price,Estiatorio Euroullas
40,I use this place for my friends meeting. Nice place. Price not expensice and hVE good choice. Normally dont need to make .reserve,Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"We stopped for lunch - a large KEO beer and two grilled meals for less than €15 - amazing value. The food (chicken fillet and pork chop, both with lovely chips) was accompanied with a small bowl of green olives and chillies and a plate with tomato and cucumber. All very tasty.The seating is a little crowded but for the quality of food and at these prices I'm not surprised it's a little squeezed up. Friendly waitresses.There are daily specials - the lady on the next table had black eyed beans with chard - it looked great. Fakes (lentils) were also available - both these pulse main courses just €5. There were various oven cooked items on the menu and kebabs too. We were very happy to find this little eatery and will definitely be back. It's impossible to find this sort of fare in most other European capital cities at these prices.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"We visited the place in the evening and while a small place taking over the corridor space between two building, staff was polite and patient to accommodate us.The menu is limited with mostly grilled meat. We had kebabs, halloumi, Cypriot sausages, salad, fries and beer. All food was perfectly prepared, fresh and tasty. Prices are very descent which makes this place value for money!You can find kebabs everywhere, but very few places make them so good at this price.",Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"If you like to taste local dishes or if you just out for lunch with friends this is a good choice. Need to reserve as is normally full. Visit Eurullas for dinner to have well cooked and tasty kebabs the Cyprus way,.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,Excellent homemade food. Small and cozy restaurant. We founded thanks to the recommendation of locals.,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,There is not much for me to say here apart from I am a Cypriot. I eat a lot of it. I feel qualified to say this place hands down serves beautiful honest tasty food. Eat the Seftalies. Mouth watering. Trust me.,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Have the chicken kebab, it’s to die for! Food of the gods. We also had pork and rice which was a bit weird with gravy, good flavors though. Great atmosphere and cool in the heat. Cheap, can’t go wrong. Try it!",Estiatorio Euroullas
40,Visited Evroullas for lunch for the first time and it was surprisingly great!!! Had the mix meze for just 11.00 euros per person. Tasty souvlaki in the middle of the narrow streets of the old town of Nicosia!!,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,This eccentric little place is one of the few that serves great meals all day. It was tough to eat well between lunch finishing and dinner starting but this is a great choice. The waiters and staff are friendly and pleasant. The food is good and great value. The menu isn't extensive and that's good because it means everything is freshly made. Try the sheftalia.,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,Go every day and will try new plates of home-cooked food. Place very short on tables for their clientele. Incredibly cheap to lunch here. Try most anything from their cooked offers.,Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"This little taverna is hidden away in a little alley off Ledras street in the heart of old Nicosia. They offer traditional Cyprus food; everyday a different menu! Food was really good, actually the best souvlaki in pitta bread I had in Cyprus and value for money!",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,We decided to GO BACK there with my colleague and it was the right decision. We just wanted to taste again their signature oven baked fish and potatoes. It was even better than what we remembered. The place is GREAT. The place is TRUE. The Service is just wonderful. MANY THANKS!,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"I love this place. They have an awesome lunch menu costing 5-7e for quality cypriot lunch meals. Stuff like beans, and fish, and pork. Menu changes everyday. High recommend. Great for vegetarians",Estiatorio Euroullas
30,"Been here a few times with family. Quality of the food if average to good. Service is polite and friendly - however they will only serve the food when it is all ready! So even if you order a salad, tahini - you will only get when all the food is ready, so you have to be patient. Location is good, nice old traditional feeling to the place",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"I am studying near there and this is my place to eat every day , if you are on Lidras and searching for a lunch this restaurant will fill up good your stomach at a very low price thumbs up for Evroulla . This is the really home made taste.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Passed by for lunch and had 8 choices of today’s selection, on Tuesday many were vegetarian, other days only 5 choices with one vegetarian. About 4 meat dishes on top across all days.I got the Lemon Chicken with Orzo (still don’t know what that is exactly), served with a side of white bread and a Greek salad. Everything was simple and very tasteful.A bargain at €6.5 including mineral water.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"My wife and I were walking around the city centre on a Sunday night, not sure where to eat. Lots of places appeared to be serving drinks and less food. So came across this little place and decided to try it. Glad we did, as food that we had was excellent. Nice glass of local wine also and really inexpensive. Would definitely go back, next time we are in Nicosia. Great atmosphere also with friendly staff.",Estiatorio Euroullas
40,Family visit at lunch time. Weekend menu differs from weekdays :) Family enjoys it. It is very affordable and right in the center. We go back frequently,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"It's a small little restaurant amongst the shops in one of the side roads off lydra street.We ordered a meze for 2 (€22) and a water and a coke which was a total of €24.The meze consisted of:2 pork souvlakia skewers2 chicken souvlakia skewers3 pieces of halloumi2 pieces of loukaniko (cypriot sausage)2 sheftalies1 bowl of salad with fetaOlives & pickled chilliChipsAnd a choice of either tzantziki, tahini and I think yoghurt, we picked tzantziki.Very tasty, filling and worth what we paid.The only let down was there were not enough fans to cool down!",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"We loved this place visiting 3 times in a week. We always went at lunch time when they have good value specials changing every day. It is mostly local cypriot cooking which was fine by us. We had meals of Afelia with rice, Lemon chicken with rice sprinkled with local cheese, Roast pork with lovely Cyprus potatoes and Kolokasi, a pork dish with taro.Most specials cost 5.50 euros and come with bread and a small salad of tomato,cucumber and small chili. Water was 2 euros per litre.The waiter is very animated and friendly as are all the staff.Very local, very good.",Estiatorio Euroullas
30,"Visited the place on a scorching hot june for lunch.Warm welcome from the staff who was extra helpful in providing with a table in front of a fan.The menu is small and focused on local cuisine,especially with ""meze"" prepared on the grill.Overall a good experience,I would definitely recommend it",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"This is precisely what I seek for in a new city -- authentic, simple, real food. A menu of no more than ten items, all prepared by people who know their craft. The best a place has to offer.Had the chance to catch at a glimpse of Evroulla, the founder of this tiny kitchen, and exchange smiles with her. It gave me the feeling of privilege and homeliness:)",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"We thoroughly enjoyed eating here, though on a Sunday lunch time it was very, very busy with locals. The food was good and the waiters were lovely they were rushed off their feet but maintained a constant service which was not easy it was so busy.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"You enter an alley way, bristling with people eating. This is EVROULLAS. The best local restaurant within the city walls of Nicosia, tucked in an alley, off LEDRA ST. Menu has many local delicacies, from full vegetarian meals, Lentils, Broad beans, Black beans with chard, Chick peas, then the meat dishes, Kolokasi, Fasolakia, with Chicken or pork or Lamb, and Baked fish. To top it all, various charcoal grilled meats, kebabs & sheftalies & Greek sausages and Haloumi. From 5-6.5e a portion. Beer 3e a big bottle. Wow, can you get up after such a meal. At lunch time you normally have to wait for a table to empty.",Estiatorio Euroullas
40,Indeed the food is very good. Basically everything is cooked on charcoal. Very cheap compared to what is offered.,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"We have found this place by luck. It just looked very inviting since it was filled up with locals.It ended up being a perfect choice. We took the cypriot meze. The portion was huge! It Everything was so tasteful. Service was fantastic!we had such a nice time, great food, cold cypriot bear... What else you can ask for on Sunday afternoon? We are sure we are going to be going back there many, many times.",Estiatorio Euroullas

40,"Very simple place, nice food and friendly staff in the very centre of Nicosia. Typical food, daily menus and cheap prices! Suggested",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"If you are in a hurry but you hate junk food try Evroullas. Cooking homemade food during weekdays lunch time and souvlaki or cyprus meze during weekends or nights. Excellent street food on charcoal. Located in a stoa, a beautiful hidden garden.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Evroulla is a restaurant frequented by the people that work at the center of Nicosia and that says a lot about it.It is located in a small passage on Onasagorou st, not a lot of tables but they do take away and there is a lot of it.The restaurant is open from Monday to Friday they have the day special dishes and grill every day. The portions are generous and the price is popular:We had Chicken Filet (they give you the entire chicken breast) and Black eye Beans served with Swiss chard, a real treat and a big bottle of water. The check was 14 EU",Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"Tucked in an alley which connects Ledra Street and its parallel this Cypriot restaurant serves mostly locals. As such, it does not try to impress but rather satisfy its steady clientele. If you are after a good satisfying meal for a reasonable price Estiatorio Euroullas is the place for you. You may have to wait until there's a seat for you but it is worth your waiting. Service is quick and efficient.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Had lunch here a few times, today had the chance to try marinated pork-chop with oven potatoes. Everything was very tasty, the chop was very tender and the potatoes seasoned very well. Prices are good ( 5-6E per meal ) and the service is casual . Recommended if you are in the area!",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,This is the best place in town for legumes . also try spaghetti with mince meat. Mixed kebabs are probably one of the best around. Mrs Evroulla takes care of everything with exceptional skill.,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,The most amazing place such a small place the menu is different daily they have the best souvlakia and sheftalia and the have 5 different home cooked meals everyday. It is a must visit.,Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"Very tasty, homemade food. Large portions and nice prices!!A sandwich will be more than enough for a meal, even for someone who is a big fan of food!",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,Love this place so much....Whenever i wish for home cooked food i go for lunch there... but you must go early for lunch otherwise you won't find anything!At night they serve grilled meat dishes. Believe me the best original souvlaki/sieftalies in town and chop pork - so good!,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,Tasty souvlaki. Low prices. medium service but it's fine.. it is worth it. I recommend this place!!!,Estiatorio Euroullas
20,"It was the first time in this restaurant and it will certainly be the last.Food was ok but the service unacceptable. After more than 30 minutes from our order, we inquired about the starter, only to be told that ""they can only service this way as it was busy"".... (the starter never arrived.....).When food finally arrived, it was delivered in intervals of 5 minutes for each of the four of us, which meant that some of us ate cold food just to try to be in sync with our friends.....Overall very poor service for ok food and an experience which was well below average.Not recommended and we will not be going back......",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Perfect prices, lovely interior, good food, big portions. Ordered pork kebab (3 sticks, tomato, cabbage) - 5 eur, chicken kebab + sheftalia (2 sticks and 2 sheftalia) - 7 eur, no potato, pita bread, pickles, lemon. Homemade lemonade is great! Staff - perfect!",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,We were staying at the Sandstone hotel just above this marvelous cookshop and as soon as we dropped our things we just went downstairs to eat. The Smell. We couldn't resist to the smell coming from this little cookshop. There you can have menu of the day where we had two portions of food and a large beer costing us EUR13.00. Everything is cooked by the big Boss Mrs. Euroulla ( she rocks btw). I still try to remember where we had this kind of food at that price. Nowhere in Cyprus. Highly recommended specially if you are around Ledras street during lunch time!,Estiatorio Euroullas
50,The most tasteful and mama's food! Right in the heart of the old Nicosia. Very friendly owner and staff. The best value for money I have noticed during last 10 years. Greetings from Crete - we will be back soon!!!,Estiatorio Euroullas
40,"A nice traditional cypriot cookshop. Cypriot kitchen, traditional dishes nicely cooked by Euroula. A good choice if you find your self downtown during lunch",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"Traditional cypriot food..well worth searching this place out. Located on the parallel street to ledra. Offers home cooked style meals at a reasonable price..not a fine dining experience, located in the stoa or corridor linking the two streets, always busy.",Estiatorio Euroullas
30,"We visited ""Estiatorio Euroullas"", since we were told for very good food in very good prices and a menu that changes through the weekdays. We ordered different dishes of meat (seftalia, sausage, souvlaki, etc), but I cannot really say that we were satisfied. It was good, but definitely not that good, rather average. The prices were indeed very good but on the other hand the portions were rather small. Overall, I would say that it is a place where you can eat reasonably well and also value for money, but you will not be impressed in any sense. However, note that we have visited the place on Saturday. Maybe on weekdays things are better.",Estiatorio Euroullas
50,"One day during our week in Cyprus, we went to visit Nicosia, a.k.a.Lefkosia. After a 3-hour pedestrian visit organized by the municipality, we wanted to have lunch, but not in the touristic places around the Tourism Center. We eventually and accidentally discovered this place, inside a cool alley full of restaurants. The server did not speak English, nor his supervisor, and they had to call a colleague to help us: certainly it was a place for locals! The restaurant offers a different list of dishes for each day of the week, and we chose one of the Thursday offers, a dish of warm stuffed vegetables (four dolmades or vine leafs, one eggplant an one tomato, each stuffed with meat and rice) served with a side dish of raw fresh vegetables, for 5.50 Euros, and a large bottle of beer for 2.00 Euros. We then asked for dessert, but we were invited to go to a local pastry shop. As the Sunday Mail Cyprus newspaper dated 19 February 2012 states: “Business is booming at Euroulla’s in Nicosia, and the reason is simple: good food, good prices!” I cannot say better...",Estiatorio Euroullas
